Utilizing an anatomical classification (cortex, cerebellum, peripheral nerves) major toxins and stresses are reviewed with selections from recent references. Selective vulnerability of certain areas to particular toxins is apparent at all levels of the CNS, although the amount of damage produced by any noxious agent depends on the age and genetic substrate of the subject. It is apparent that the effects of certain well known and long respected environmental toxins such as lead, mercury, etc., deserve continued surveillance. In addition, the overwhelming impact on the CNS of social damages such as trauma, alcohol, and tobacco cannot be ignored by environmentalists. The effect of the hospital and therapeutic environment has become apparent in view of increased awareness of iatrogenic disorders. The need for particular laboratory tests, for example, examination of CSF and nerve conduction toxicity studies, is suggested. Epidemics such as the recent solvent neuropathies suggest a need for continued animal studies that are chronic, as well as acute evaluations when predicting the potential toxic effects of industrial compounds.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="envhper00486-0078.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="75" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="envhper00486-0079.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="76" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="envhper00486-0080.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="77" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="envhper00486-0081.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="78" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="envhper00486-0082.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="79" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="envhper00486-0083.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="80" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="envhper00486-0084.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="81" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="envhper00486-0085.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="82" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="envhper00486-0086.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="83" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="envhper00486-0087.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="84" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="envhper00486-0088.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="85" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="envhper00486-0089.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="86" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="envhper00486-0090.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="87" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="envhper00486-0091.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="88" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="envhper00486-0092.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="89" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="envhper00486-0093.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="90" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="envhper00486-0094.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="91" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="envhper00486-0095.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="92" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="envhper00486-0096.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="93" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="envhper00486-0097.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="94" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="envhper00486-0098.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="95" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="envhper00486-0099.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="96" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
