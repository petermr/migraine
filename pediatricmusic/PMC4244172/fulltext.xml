Latin caregivers experience caregiving as less challenging than Caucasians. Factors influencing burden include scholarship of the caregiver, relationship with the patient, motor and cognitive decline of the disease. To date there are no studies addressing the issue in Mexican caregivers of multiple sclerosis patients.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To describe the prevalence and predicting factors of caregiver burden in multiple sclerosis within a Mexican population.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> 99 Caregiver-patient pairs were recruited during scheduled office visits. Demographic data was recollected. Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI) was administered to caregivers and Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) was calculated in each patient.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Some degree of caregiver burden was found in 60.6%, being moderate or severe in 31.1%. The &#x0201c;Impact of caregiving&#x0201d; subdimension accounted for most weight of the construct. The median patient disability according to the EDSS was 5.5. Variables predicting caregiver burden were EDSS (p &#x0003c; 0.001, CI 95% 0.09-0.21), daily hours of caregiving (p &#x0003c; 0.001, CI 95% 0.81-0.91) and incomplete high-school for caregivers (p = 0.030, CI 95% 0.01-0.79). Daily hours of caregiving also predicted each subdimension of the ZBI independently. Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to determine the goodness of fit of the normal distribution of the interval variables. A likelihood ratio test was performed comparing the complete model with a reduced one including only the predicting factors, obtaining a significant p = 0.0014 for 6 degrees of freedom.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Caregiver&#x02019;s burden prevalence was much higher than reported previously. In fact, even moderate or severe burden were higher than the overall burden described in other studies. Predicting factors were similar to those found in previous reports. Considering the higher prevalence of caregiver burden found, it is possible that the study sample was underestimated. If this is so, there&#x02019;s a chance that two more variables (Age of caregiver and Months spent as caregiver) could have reached significance providing the sample was enlarged. According to the results, neurologists should implement supporting measures for caregivers, addressing the time they spend with their patients. Future research should focus in other patient&#x02019;s variables and cultural environment.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section4-1352458514546077"><title>P002</title><sec id="section5-1352458514546077"><title>How do MS patients&#x02019; sickness absence and disability pension trajectories develop over time?

Matched controls were followed over an equivalent time period. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated with General Estimation Equations (GEE) using a negative binominal distribution. A piecewise GEE model was fitted to evaluate if socio-demographics influenced the progression of MS patients&#x02019; SA/DP trajectories at three distinct time periods, i.e., t-5 - t-1, t1- t1 and t1 - t5.

The patients have many social problems. In many countries especially &#x00131;n developing ones, there are little knowledge about the disease and its course in the community. So that the patients may be lack of social support during their lives.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> The aim of this study was to investigate the perception of Multiple Sclerosis in Turkey, in an eastern city K&#x000fc;tahya.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> The Survey of multiple sclerosis patients, their relatives and control group on the Knowledge, Attitudes, and Behavior Regarding the Disorder was used and included questions on descriptive characteristics, familiarity with multiple sclerosis(MS), attitudes toward MS, and understanding of MS.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> 71 MS, 46 relatives of MS patient and 40 control group included in the study. The control group were consisted of the people which had no MS diagnose or no relatives or friends with MS. Mean age of the MS patients, relatives and control group were 37yr (min19-max56), 40yr(min19-max66), 39(18-67), respectively. In the MS patient and relative groups; 10(14%) and 4(8:7%) of them concealed the diagnosis from other people. Both the patient and relatives groups had knowledge about the symptoms of the disease; however in the control group 30 (75%) people had no idea about the disease or the symptoms or about the etiology. Of the patients 61(85.9%) had no social problems, while 5(7%) had been fired of their work and 3(4.2%) had stigmatization.

The paper-based questionnaire inquired about details of current employment and impact of MS-related disability on working capability. The survey was supplemented by clinical data derived from the most recent medical report.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The questionnaire was handed out to 644 patients and returned by 449 (68%). Individuals above the retirement age (n=44) were excluded. A total of 405 patients (women 266, 66%) with a mean age of 44 years (range 18-64), median EDSS of 3.0 (range 0-8.5) and median disease duration of 12.4 years (range 1-43) were subjected to further analysis. Full-time employment was declared by 108 patients (27%, median EDSS 2.0 (0-6.5), mean age 40.8 y (19-62), median disease duration 10.5 y (range 1-43) women 58 (54%)). A total of 104 patients (26%, median EDSS 3.0 (1.0-7.0), mean age 45 y (26-63), mean disease duration 12.4 y (range 1.7-34.0) women 68 (65%)) had scaled down to part-time work because of disease-related issues. Complete inability to work was reported by 110 patients (27%, median EDSS 5.0 (1-8.5), mean age 48 y (25-65), median disease duration 16.0 y (range 3.2-43.0) women 73 (66%)). 83 patients (21%) were not employed but reported other reasons than MS (mostly care for children, household).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our data further corroborate the toll this disorder takes on the life of the patients and caregivers early in the course and despite emerging treatment options. Only less than one-third of the patients in a cross-sectional cohort of Swiss MS patients with mostly mild impairment were fully employed. Part-time work is common despite limited disability. Further efforts need to be taken in order to develop measures to preserve and regain working capability. Moreover, studies aimed to assess potential gender-and education-related inequalities are warranted.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section10-1352458514546077"><title>P005</title><sec id="section11-1352458514546077"><title>Profile of social participation of multiple sclerosis adults in Qu&#x000e9;bec city</title><p><underline>N Lacroix</underline><sup>1,2</sup>, N Boucher<sup>1,2</sup>, P Villeneuve<sup>2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Universit&#x000e9; Laval, CIRRIS (Center for Interdisciplinary Research in Rehabilitation and Social Integration), Quebec, QC, Canada, <sup>2</sup>Universit&#x000e9; Laval, School of Social Work, Quebec, QC, Canada</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Many studies have presented the physical and psychological consequences of chronic degenerative diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS).

Data were collected through telephone interviews using questionnaires. Social participation was evaluated using the Assessment of Life Habits (LIFE-H), which quantifies the level of difficulty and support required to carry out various life habits. The Participation and Activity Limitation Survey (2006) was used to collect additional data regarding participation in employment. Socio-demographic and disease-related variables such as type of MS, years since diagnosis and self-evaluation of the presence and importance of symptoms were also documented.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Of the 90 participants (74.4% female, age 23-78, median = 53.2), 62.2% had relapsing remitting MS, 11.1% had primary progressive, and 23.3% had secondary progressive. The LIFE-H results showed that social roles (mean = 7.5) were more affected than ADLs (mean = 8.7). The most affected area of social participation were Recreation (49.4%), Employment (43.0%), Mobility (32.2%), Fitness (22.2%), and Interpersonal relationships (12.4%). Symptoms with the most important perceived impact were fatigue (59.3%), leg weakness (40.4%), bladder dysfunction (33.3%), heat sensitivity (31.3%), and balance problems (31.0%). Multiple linear regression analyses showed the following significant (p &#x0003c; 0.05) relationships with social participation categories:</p><list list-type="order" id="list3-1352458514546077"><list-item><p>balance problems and leg weakness explained variance in Mobility scores,</p></list-item><list-item><p>depression and sexual problems in Interpersonal relationship scores, and</p></list-item><list-item><p>leg weakness and cognitive changes in Leisure scores.</p></list-item></list><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> These findings show that, if it&#x02019;s possible to correlate most perceived impact of the symptoms with life habits accomplishment, when put in multiple linear regression, only few emerge as significant. Interaction seems more important than individual disease-related factors. These outcomes suggest that some other factors, like work status, might be as important as individual disease-related factors for the accomplishment of daily activities and social roles.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section12-1352458514546077"><title>P006</title><sec id="section13-1352458514546077"><title>Determinants of stigma experienced by patients suffering from multiple sclerosis.

Co-evaluating stigma assessment tools may be useful towards this direction. The term &#x02018;stigma&#x02019; is used to describe the amount of social isolation-reject experienced by a patient due to his medical condition.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> Aim of this study was to investigate the main determinants of stigma among Hellenic MS patients.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> We used a sample of 299 MS sufferers that visited the Outpatient Clinic of our Hospital. The data collected concerned demographic elements, habits, disease-derived variables (EDSS, disease subtype, imaging etc), as well as the Stigma Scale for Chronic Illness (SSCI) questionnaire. Statistical processing included univariate analysis, and variables significant below p=0.05 were assessed further in multiple regression models. Principal component analysis confirmed two independent stigma measuring factors (internal: coming from the inner self - external: coming from the social environment). SSCI&#x02019;s reliability was satisfactory (Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha = 0.923).</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Mean age of patients was 43.2 years and mean disease duration was 12 years. Female sex was predominant (67.2%), while the relapsing-remitting disease subtype was the most frequent (70%). The majority of patients were married (59.2%) with children (58.2%), and active workers (55.2%). 45.2% of them had received tertiary level education. Any type of social support (family, friends, social structures) was present in 92% of cases. Age, disease duration, EDSS score, disease subtype, occupational status and social support could explain the variability of 24.5%, 22.4% and 20.5% of the total, internal and external stigma respectively. Higher EDSS scores and lower social support correlated with higher total, internal and external stigma (p&#x0003c; 0.0001 and p=0.01 respectively), independently of all other factors.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Surprisingly, despite the ongoing economical crisis in Greece, occupational status had much lower influence than disability and social support in total stigma formation. Lower social support had also lower influence in external than internal stigma, fact that maybe reflects the stable Hellenic social solidarity. Other aforementioned demographic and laboratorial parameters, did not seem to further influence stigma.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section14-1352458514546077"><title>P007</title><sec id="section15-1352458514546077"><title>A 10-year longitudinal study of use of and satisfaction with health care in a population-based sample of people with MS</title><p><underline>C Chruzander</underline><sup>1,2</sup>, S Johansson<sup>1,2</sup>, L Wid&#x000e9;n Holmqvist<sup>1,2</sup>, K Gottberg<sup>3</sup>, U Einarsson<sup>2</sup>, C Ytterberg<sup>1,2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Karolinska Institute, Neurobiology, Care Science and Society, Stockholm, Sweden, <sup>2</sup>Karolinska University Hospital, Department of Physiotherapy, Stockholm, Sweden, <sup>3</sup>Karolinska Institutet, Neurobiology, Care Science and Society, Division of Nursing, Huddinge, Sweden</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> People with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) use a large amount of health care services with hospital care and primary care in parallel and many departments and services involved. Several studies have demonstrated that PwMS are unsatisfied with several areas of health care services. For the purpose of improving health care services for PwMS it is important to investigate their satisfaction with care in a long-term perspective.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> The aim of this 10-year follow-up of a population-based sample of PwMS was to explore the use of health care in a long-term perspective (10 years). An additional aim was to explore the satisfaction with health care services from the perspective of the PwMS over 10 years.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> This study was based on a 10-year follow-up of a population-based study in Stockholm (n=166). Home visits were used to collect data on personal and disease-specific factors, functioning and satisfaction with health care. Data on use of total outpatient health care (including primary care and outpatient hospital care) and inpatient health care were obtained from the computerised register of the Stockholm County Council.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> A total number of 35 984 outpatient contacts were registered from baseline to the 10-year follow-up of which 65% were registered in primary care and 35% in hospital outpatient care. Contacts with nurses composed 47% (n=11 019) of the total number of contacts in primary care. A total number of 4108 days were registered for inpatient hospital care; mean 22 days per PwMS, range 0-302 days. Seventy-one percent of the PwMS were satisfied with the efficacy/outcome of primary care at both baseline and at the 10-year follow-up. There was a significant increase in the proportion of PwMS who were satisfied with the efficacy/outcome of hospital out-patient care, from 75% to 85%.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Preliminary results demonstrate that primary care constitute a large portion of the total care used and that a third of the PwMS express that they are unsatisfied with the outcome/efficacy of primary care. Further analyses are needed to explore which factors are associated with the use of health care.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section16-1352458514546077"><title>P008</title><sec id="section17-1352458514546077"><title>Differences in health care utilization over 10 years between people with MS who entered a nursing home and those who did not</title><p>M Finlayson<sup>1</sup>, <underline>RA Marrie</underline><sup>2</sup>, GS Finlayson<sup>3</sup>, O Ekuma<sup>2</sup>, D Jiang<sup>2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Queen&#x02019;s University, Kingston, ON, Canada, <sup>2</sup>University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, ON, Canada, <sup>3</sup>Manitoba Centre for Health Policy, Winnipeg, ON, Canada</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> People with MS often require increasing amounts of physical care over time. For approximately 5-10% of people with MS, care needs may lead to nursing home (NH) entry. Understanding longitudinal patterns of health care utilization (HCU) may offer opportunities to identify individuals at risk of NH entry, which may inform interventions to prevent or delay this outcome.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To compare the 10-year trajectories for three annualized indicators of HCU between people with MS who entered a NH and those who did not.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Population-based, de-identified claims data from the Population Health Research Data Repository at the Manitoba Centre for Health Policy were used for this case-control analysis. Applying a validated algorithm we identified all Manitobans with MS between 1984 and 2012. From this pool, cases were identified (nursing home entrant at any point since 2005). Cases were matched to controls (not resident in a nursing home since 2005) by age, sex, geographic region, and date of first demyelinating disease claim. The HCU trajectories for ambulatory physician visits, number of prescriptions, and hospital days were generated using semi-parametric group-based trajectory approaches. The Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) was used to select the best model together with theoretical considerations. The trajectories displayed changes in HCU for each annualized HCU indicator over time for both groups.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> 226 cases and 896 controls were identified, for a total of 1122. The average age of the cases was 48.35 (SD=13.25) and 44.91 for the controls (SD=11.58).

Additional burdens on society, the healthcare system, caregivers, and patients can cause productivity losses due to short- and long-term absences from work, time lost from work and leisure, and early retirement.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To summarize evidence relating to the economic burden in relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS), secondary progressive MS (SPMS), and other forms of progressive MS and to evaluate costs associated with levels of disability in MS as measured by the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS).</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Comprehensive systematic searches were conducted in MEDLINE, Embase, and the National Health Service Economic Evaluation Database (NHS EED) for relevant articles published between January 2003 and November 2013 using pre-defined Medical Subject Heading and free-text terms. Proceedings of relevant scientific meetings were also hand-searched. Articles underwent two rounds of screening by independent researchers. Data were extracted by one investigator and validated by a second, independent investigator.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Fifty-six studies reporting direct (medical and non-medical), indirect, or intangible costs conducted in Europe (41), North America (5), South America (6), Australia (1), and Asia (3) were included. The majority of studies estimated cost from a societal perspective. Direct costs were mainly driven by medication costs, followed by cost of procedures and visits to healthcare providers. Indirect costs consisted mainly of productivity losses due to short- and long-term absences from work, and early retirement due to MS. Similarly, total costs were driven by medication costs and disease severity. Relapses were also associated with increased total cost. Direct, indirect, and total costs increased with higher levels of disability as measured by EDSS score. All cost components varied by country, reflecting variations in practice patterns, and also by MS type; costs were much higher for SPMS than for primary progressive MS or RRMS.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> MS is associated with significant economic burden. Total, direct, and indirect costs increase with increasing disease severity and during relapses. MS costs vary by geographical location. Treatments which reduce relapses and delay disability progression could reduce the overall costs of MS to patients and the healthcare system.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section26-1352458514546077"><title>P013</title><sec id="section27-1352458514546077"><title>Cost-effectiveness of alemtuzumab vs subcutaneous interferon beta-1a for treatment of active relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis: payer perspective</title><p><underline>C Celestin</underline><sup>1</sup>, GR Cutter<sup>2</sup>, AJ Coles<sup>3</sup>, A Reimers<sup>4</sup>, DH Margolin<sup>1</sup>, on behalf of the CARE-MS I and II Investigators</p><p><sup>1</sup>Genzyme, a Sanofi Company, Cambridge, MA, United States, <sup>2</sup>University of Alabama at Birmingham, Department of Biostatistics, Birmingham, AL, United States, <sup>3</sup>University of Cambridge, Addenbrooke&#x02019;s Hospital, Cambridge, United Kingdom, <sup>4</sup>Genzyme, a Sanofi Company, Stockholm, Sweden</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Alemtuzumab is approved in over 30 countries for treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). Alemtuzumab demonstrated superior efficacy over subcutaneous interferon beta-1a (SC IFNB-1a) and manageable safety in RRMS patients (treatment-naive or who relapsed on a prior therapy). Given increasing constraints on health care resources, there is a need to evaluate the relative value of alemtuzumab compared with a commonly accepted therapy for treatment of RRMS.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To compare the cost-effectiveness of alemtuzumab vs SC IFNB-1a in active RRMS patients in Sweden.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> In the Comparison of Alemtuzumab and Rebif<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Efficacy in Multiple Sclerosis (CARE-MS) studies, RRMS patients (treatment-naive [CARE-MS I (NCT00530348)] or who relapsed on prior therapy [CARE-MS II (NCT00548405)]) were randomized to alemtuzumab 12 mg/day intravenously on 5 consecutive days at baseline and on 3 consecutive days 12 months later, or SC IFNB-1a (44 &#x000b5;g 3 times weekly). A cohort-based Markov model based on School of Health and Related Research model was used to estimate incremental costs and benefits. The model tracks patients as they progress through a series of disability states, using a 1-year cycle length. Costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) per patient were calculated based on time in each Expanded Disability Status Scale state, relapse incidence, adverse events, and treatment duration. The outcomes reported include incremental costs in Swedish krona (SEK) per QALY gained, incremental costs per life-year (LY) gained, and incremental costs per relapse avoided. A societal perspective was taken with a lifetime time horizon using data from CARE-MS I and II trials.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Alemtuzumab is more effective and less costly than SC IFNB-1a across all outcomes in RRMS patient populations, which is important to payers.

Income from Earnings, Disability pension (DP), Sickness absence (SA), Disability allowance, Unemployment benefits, and Social welfare were analysed for all as well as stratified by socio-demographics and year since MS diagnosis.

MS patients and the matched reference population had equivalent amounts of incomes from social welfare, but the MS patients had lower earnings and unemployment benefits and higher income from disability allowance, DP and SA. The MS patients diagnosed in 2010 had 16% lower earnings than the matched reference group, while MS patients diagnosed before 2005 had 39% lower earnings. Corresponding figures regarding benefits were 30% and 132% higher for MS patients. Further, the matched reference group&#x02019;s earnings peaked in ages 45-54 whereas the MS patients income peaked in ages 35-44.

The WPAI survey measured employment status, absenteeism, presenteeism (impairment during work), overall work impairment, and daily activity impairment. Patients who reported &#x0201c;working for pay&#x0201d; were classified as employed while those &#x0201c;temporarily not working but looking for work&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;not working or looking for work due to age&#x0201d;, and &#x0201c;not working or looking for work due to disability&#x0201d; were considered not employed. The patients also underwent an examination to assess Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS). Brain T1 hypointense lesion volume (T1LV) and T2 hyperintense LV (T2LV) were expert-quantified using an edge-finding tool. To assess a lesional destructive capability, we calcualted the ratio of T1LV to T2LV (T1/T2) for each subject. To assess whole brain atrophy, we measured normalized brain parenchymal volume (BPV) from 3D T1-weighted images using SIENAX.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The mean (SD) age was 45.5 (9.7) years and disease duration was 12.1 (8.1) years; 75% were women, 76% had relapsing-remitting MS, and 76% were working for pay. T1LV, T1/T2, and EDSS score were higher and BPV was lower in the not employed group vs. the employed group (Wilcoxon rank-sum tests, p&#x0003c; 0.05). Age, disease duration, and T2LV did not differ between groups (p&#x0003e;0.05). In a multivariable logistic regression model adjusting for age, gender, and disease duration, higher T1LV was associated with a lower chance of working for pay (p&#x0003c; 0.05).

Disability in MS is commonly measured by the Kurtzke Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), a clinician-based neurological impairment rating scale. Scores range from 0 to 10 and higher scores indicate greater disability.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> Comprehensive systematic literature reviews were conducted to summarize the evidence relating to the health utility impact of RRMS, secondary progressive MS (SPMS), and other forms of progressive MS. Evidence on the utilities associated with different levels of disability in MS as measured by the EDSS was also evaluated.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Using pre-defined Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) and free-text terms, systematic searches were conducted in MEDLINE, Embase, and NHS EED databases for relevant articles published between January 2003 and November 2013. Proceedings of relevant scientific meetings were also hand-searched. Citations returned from the searches underwent two rounds of screening by independent researchers based on predefined inclusion/exclusion criteria. The first round was based on titles/abstracts, while the second round was based on full texts of articles meeting the inclusion criteria. Data were extracted by one investigator and validated by a second, independent investigator.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Twenty-seven studies reporting health utilities associated with health states of MS met the inclusion criteria for the review. The majority of studies (26 studies) elicited preference via the European Quality of Life Five Dimensions (EQ-5D) questionnaire, a generic preference elicitation instrument; one study used the Health Utilities Index-3 (HUI-3). There was an inverse relationship between utilities and EDSS scores; no trend was noted for geographical location. Mean utility scores ranged from 0.80 to 0.88, 0.49 to 0.70, 0.38 to 0.58, and -0.03 to 0.1 for patients with EDSS scores of 0-1, 3, 6, and &#x02265;8, respectively. Some patients valued their health states as worse than death as reflected by the negative utility scores.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> MS negatively impacts health utilities which decrease significantly with increasing neurological disability. Relapses were also associated with decreases in utility scores. There appears to be no differential effect of MS type and geographical location on health utilities. Treatments for MS that delay disability progression may allow a patient to remain in a better health state utility longer.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section38-1352458514546077"><title>P019</title><sec id="section39-1352458514546077"><title>Cost of MS - patients&#x02019; burden in Norway</title><p><underline>BO Svendsen</underline><sup>1</sup>, K-M Myhr<sup>2</sup>, NG Torkildsen<sup>1</sup>, T Smedal<sup>1</sup>, L Boe<sup>1</sup>, JH Aarseth<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Haukeland University Hospital, Department of Neurology, Bergen, Norway, <sup>2</sup>University of Bergen, Department of Clinical Medicine, Bergen, Norway</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Multiple sclerosis (MS) often implies a high burden of the disease to the patients and reduces quality of life. The disease has major health economic impact on society, but MS also imposes costs on the patients themselves. The magnitude of these costs has not been investigated.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> The objective of this work was to estimate the annual cost (in 2013), as well as estimate the long term cost of multiple sclerosis to patients in Norway.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Information on disease related economic burden was gathered through a postal survey to all MS-patients in Hordaland County, Norway. The postal survey was sent to all persons (n=) 965, who had received a definite MS-diagnosis according to the Poser or McDonald&#x02019;s criteria who were alive at the end of 2013.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> 27 questionnaires were returned because of unknown adressees, and 5 persons were reported recently dead. Of the remaining 933, 562 responded.</p><p>The average annual (2013) total, indirect plus direct, economic cost to patients was &#x020ac; 11,337. Indirect economic cost, loss of income, accounted for 63 %. Remodelling of houses, &#x020ac; 1,590, constituted the most important direct economic cost - patients&#x02019; payment for resources used due to the disease. Direct economic cost was close to identical for females and males. Indirect economic cost was close to 10 % higher for males, mainly due to higher salaries before diagnosis. Over a period of 30 years, the present value of the average annual total economic cost amounted to &#x020ac; 258,986 when a 2 % discount rate was used to adjust for differential timing of costs. In general, costs inceased with progressive disease severity, and patients with a rapid disability progression had a much higher cost than patients that progressed more slowly. For patients among the 10 % with the most rapid progression, the present value of the 30-year annual total economic costs from disease onset might easily exceed &#x020ac; 410,000 and be expected to come close to &#x020ac; 600.000 in extreme cases. For patients among the 10 % with the slowest progression expected present value ranged from &#x020ac; 29,000 to &#x020ac; 97,000.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The cost of MS to the patients is a significant part of the burden of the disease for all patients, especially patients with severe forms of the disease. This, patient centered, information should be important to health politicians who are to decide on allocation of resources to treatment and research on the disease, and on economic support to patients with MS.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section40-1352458514546077"><title>P020</title><sec id="section41-1352458514546077"><title>Updates from the Sonya Slifka longitudinal multiple sclerosis study and the comprehensive analysis of the direct and indirect costs of MS study</title><p><underline>SL Minden</underline><sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Brigham and Women&#x02019;s Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Psychiatry, Boston, MA, United States</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> The National Multiple Sclerosis Society&#x02019;s (NMSS) <italic>Sonya Slifka Longitudinal Multiple Sclerosis Study (Slifka</italic>) began in 2000 to study change in demographic and disease characteristics, quality of life, use and cost of health services, and treatment, economic, and psychosocial outcomes among a generally representative sample of almost 2,200 individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS) in the United States (US).

These data, with demographic and disease updates, were collected by computer-assisted telephone interviews every 6 months through 2010. The 2009 wave (n=2,361) provides event-based data on use and costs of services (inpatient, emergency, day hospital, physician, rehabilitation, mental health, alternative; tests, treatments, procedures; paid/unpaid home care) and types and costs of purchases (DMTs; prescription drugs; home/vehicle modifications; equipment/supplies; transportation). Our multidisciplinary team of clinicians, economists, health services and policy researchers are producing bi- and multivariate statistics for service use and purchases and estimating their cost. We mapped patient-reported procedures to standardized billing codes and assigned Medicare prices and estimated medication prices using national average Medicaid reimbursements. Unpaid home care was valued at the rates paid for equivalent services by other participants in their communities.

In Portugal there are about 2,694 patients treated with interferon beta (IFNB) and it is estimated that 30.4% are poor responders (disability progression of &#x02265;1 point in EDSS scale) and can benefit from second-line treatment. Fingolimod treatment costs are an obstacle to treatment escalation, despite the fact that early initiation of fingolimod may impact favorably on long-term clinical outcomes.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> This analysis aimed to assess if the early switch from IFNB to fingolimod impacts MS clinical outcomes and promotes better resource utilization in a Portuguese hospital perspective.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> TThis analysis was based on the annualized relapse rate of TRANSFORMS phase III trial extension. A cost-effectiveness model was developed to calculate the cost per relapse avoided with 4.5 years of continuous treatment with fingolimod (early treatment) versus 1 year of treatment with IFNB followed by a 3.5 years of treatment with fingolimod (delayed treatment). A Portuguese hospital perspective was adopted addressing only direct costs: drug, monitoring and relapses&#x02019; treatment. Drug costs were based on Portuguese list prices, while the unit cost of each complication was obtained from the Diagnosis Related Groups tariff. The costs of relapses were derived from the Portuguese literature.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Assuming there are 819 patients treated with IFNB that are poor responders, the early treatment with fingolimod resulted in more relapses avoided when compared with delayed treatment with fingolimod (2,211 versus 1,843) - an additional 369 relapses avoided. The early treatment with fingolimod led to an increase of drug acquisition costs, but reduced cost associated to monitoring and relapses&#x02019; treatment. The total costs were 86,380,820&#x020ac; for early treatment versus 79,257,091&#x020ac; for delayed treatment. This represents an average incremental investment of 1,933&#x020ac; per patient per year. The early strategy resulted an incremental cost effectiveness ratio of 19,358&#x020ac; per relapse avoided when compared with the delayed strategy.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Under the Portuguese hospital perspective, early treatment with fingolimod is expected to result in better clinical outcomes associated with a more efficient healthcare resources allocation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section44-1352458514546077"><title>P022</title><sec id="section45-1352458514546077"><title>The economic cost of a multiple sclerosis relapse</title><p><underline>K O&#x02019;Connell</underline><sup>1</sup>, SB Kelly<sup>1</sup>, E Fogarty<sup>2</sup>, M Duggan<sup>1</sup>, L Buckley<sup>1</sup>, M Hutchinson<sup>1</sup>, C McGuigan<sup>1</sup>, N Tubridy<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>St Vincents University Hospital, Dublin, Ireland, <sup>2</sup>National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics, St James&#x02019; Hospital, Dublin, Ireland</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Multiple sclerosis (MS) commonly affects young adults and can be associated with significant disability resulting in considerable socioeconomic burden for both patient and society.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> The aim was to determine the direct and indirect cost of an MS relapse.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> This was an prospective audit composed of medical chart review and patient questionnaire. Relapses were stratified into 3 groups: low, moderate and high intensity. Age, gender, MS subtype, disease duration, expanded disability status scale (EDSS), disease modifying therapy (DMT) use and employment status were recorded. Direct costs included GP visits, investigations, clinic visit, consultations with medical staff, medication and admission costs. Indirect costs assessed loss of earnings, partner&#x02019;s loss of earnings, childcare, meals and travel costs.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Fifty-three patients had a clinically confirmed relapse. Thirsteen were of low intensity; 23 moderate intensity and 17 high intensity with mean costs of &#x020ac;503, &#x020ac;1395 and &#x020ac;8862 respectively. Those with high intensity episodes tended to be older with higher baseline EDSS (p&#x0003c; 0.003) and change in EDSS (p&#x0003c; 0.002). Direct costs were consistent in both low and moderate intensity groups but varied with length of hospital stay in the high intensity group.

Visit 1 was conducted per clinic routine. Visit 2 included the FILMS instrument. Patient and clinician perception of visit quality was assessed at the end of each of the visits using a 1-5 Likert scale.

Similarly, we observed distinct, unmet needs reported by the subjects with different characteristics as well as financial and psychological support were reported primarily by newly diagnosed subjects, while the architectural barriers in public places, personal assistance, and transportation were reported by the sickest patients. Finally, among the services to be enhanced and improved, the rehabilitation, transportation, and homecare service were more frequent in the sickest patients while the MS clinical centres, financial and psychological support in newly diagnosed subjects.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The MS population is a heterogeneous population as a result of different difficulties and needs perceived according to the clinical stage and disability degree. Focusing on individual patient needs is a prerequisite for a patient-centred approach, which also means engaging patients in healthcare decision making as much as possible. These findings suggest that personalised treatments could provide the basis for improving and changing the access and coordination of community services and to drive policymakers towards the development of an MS-specific and personalised taking charge.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section50-1352458514546077"><title>P025</title><sec id="section51-1352458514546077"><title>A health resource utilization in Thai patients with idiopathic inflammatory demyelinating central nervous system disorders</title><p>C Chanatittarat<sup>1</sup>, <underline>S Siritho</underline><sup>2,3</sup>, N Prayoonwiwat<sup>2</sup>, U Chaikledkaew<sup>1</sup>, P Pasogpakdee<sup>4</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Social and Administrative Pharmacy Excellence Research (SAPER) Unit, Pharmacy, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand, <sup>2</sup>Division of Neurology,Siriraj Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand, <sup>3</sup>Bumrungrad International Hospital, Neurology Dept., Bangkok, Thailand, <sup>4</sup>Sriphat Medical Center, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Increasing awareness of Thai patients with Idiopathic Inflammatory Demyelinating Central Nervous System Disorders (IIDCDs) such as neuromyelitis optica (NMO) and multiple sclerosis (MS) causes higher prevalence of the diseases over the past decade.

Then direct medical cost (DMC) of 169 patients besides demographic data and 5 year disease burden alongside the study was retrospectively reviewed in one center. All expenses were adjusted to 2014 years using consumer price index and US exchange rate of 32.58 Baht.

Prior studies have shown MS patients with high DMT adherence have better health outcomes and lower costs than non-compliant patients. However, no study has examined the effects of improving DMT adherence on medical cost offset.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> This study estimated the effect of DMT adherence on healthcare resource use and cost outcomes for patients with MS. The impact of improving adherence on the same outcomes was modeled overall and within patient subgroups.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> A retrospective analysis was conducted using OptumHealth Reporting &#x00026; Insights employer claims database on MS patients (&#x02265;2 diagnoses of ICD-9-CM 340) initiating DMT from 1/1/2002 through 3/31/2012. Direct medical costs (paid amounts to providers for services or drugs, excluding payments for DMTs), indirect costs (disability payments to employees and workloss costs to employers), and resource use were analyzed in the 6 months prior to initiation of any DMT (baseline period) and up to 3 years after initiation (follow-up period). Adherence to any DMT was measured by proportion of days covered (PDC). Multivariate regression analyses were used to estimate the effect of PDC on follow-up period outcomes, controlling for baseline characteristics. The estimated model was used to predict the change in utilization and costs associated with a 10 percentage point improvement in PDC.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> 1,538 patients met the selection criteria (baseline age 43.6 years, 63% female). PDC had a statistically significant effect on direct medical and indirect work productivity costs, workloss days, and likelihood of an inpatient stay or emergency visit at 1, 2, and 3 year follow-up periods (all p&#x0003c; 0.01). A 10 percentage point improvement in PDC was estimated to reduce direct costs by 4%, indirect costs by 3-4%, workloss days by 3-7%, likelihood of an inpatient stay by 13-19%, and likelihood of an emergency visit by 8-19%, depending on the follow-up period. The impact on the likelihood of an inpatient stay or emergency visit increased with the length of the follow-up period. In the first year, the decrease in direct costs associated with a 10% improvement in adherence was greater for patients with PDC&#x02265;0.8 (10%), men (6%), and patients not on disability in the baseline period (5%).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Improved adherence to DMTs is associated with lower medical and indirect costs, reduced workloss days, and decreased inpatient stays and emergency visits for MS patients.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section60-1352458514546077"><title>P030</title><sec id="section61-1352458514546077"><title>Application of the RAND/UCLA method to explore the appropriateness of current and emerging treatments for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis</title><p><underline>HJ Stoevelaar</underline><sup>1</sup>, F Barkhof<sup>2</sup>, T Berger<sup>3</sup>, D Centonze<sup>4</sup>, C Papeix<sup>5</sup>, A Tourbah<sup>6</sup>, T Ziemssen<sup>7</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Ismar Healthcare, Centre for Decision Analysis and Support, Lier, Belgium, <sup>2</sup>VU University Medical Center, Department of Radiology, Amsterdam, Netherlands, <sup>3</sup>Innsbruck Medical University, Clinical Department of Neurology, Innsbruck, Austria, <sup>4</sup>U.O.C.

Over the last few years, several disease-modifying treatments (DMTs) have been introduced, and new medications are expected to be approved in the near future. All established and novel DMTs have specific efficacy-safety profiles, and treatment choice requires individual balancing of benefits (e.g. decreased relapse rate, delayed disability progression) versus potential safety risks.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To develop a comprehensive model for weighing benefits and risks of DMTs in relation to specific patient characteristics.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method (RUAM) was used to systematically assess the appropriateness of available and novel DMTs for a variety of clinical scenarios. A treatment was considered appropriate when the expected benefits largely exceeded the potential risks. A panel of 12 European experts in MS individually judged the appropriateness of 10 treatment regimens (including no/deferred treatment) for hundreds of clinical scenarios, using a 9-point scale. Scenarios were combinations of several patient characteristics such as treatment history, disease activity status (a.o. number of relapses and new T2 lesions in the last year), disability progression (EDSS increase), and presence of MS-related and unrelated co-morbidities. The panel process consisted of 2 individual ratings rounds and 3 panel meetings to prepare the scenarios and to discuss the results. Based on the median panel score and extent of agreement, for each scenario an appropriateness statement was calculated (appropriate, inappropriate, uncertain).</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Agreement (&#x02265; 75% of ratings in the same section of the 9-point scale) increased from 32% to 45% in the second round.

Results between the two rounds showed that ratings are highly sensitive for new scientific evidence and regulatory changes.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The RUAM proved to be a valuable approach to weigh the benefits and risks of established and novel DMTs for RRMS at the level of individual patients. Periodic review of the results in light of new scientific evidence and regulatory approval is mandatory.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section62-1352458514546077"><title>P031</title><sec id="section63-1352458514546077"><title>Presenteeism and quality of life between MS patients and healthy workers</title><p>A Ferreira<sup>1</sup>, AM Passos<sup>1</sup>, <underline>MR Neves</underline><sup>1</sup>, C Sousa<sup>2</sup>, MJ S&#x000e1;<sup>2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Instituto Universit&#x000e1;rio de Lisboa (ISCTE-IUL), Business Research Unit, Lisboa, Portugal, <sup>2</sup>Hospital de S&#x000e3;o Jo&#x000e3;o, Porto, Portugal</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> In recent years there has been a growing interest in the study of quality of life (QoL) in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). However the study of QoL and well-being in patients with MS in the workplace is a totally unexplored area of research. Presenteeism is the behavior of being present at work with a physical or psychological state that limits the capacity to produce. The symptoms associated with health problems (e.g. depression, anxiety) are responsible for a significant and undeniable reduction of job performance.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold></p><list list-type="order" id="list6-1352458514546077"><list-item><p>To compare productivity in spite of both presenteeism and QoL of individuals with and without MS</p></list-item><list-item><p>To analyze the influence of psychological antecedents of depression and anxiety on productivity in spite of presenteeism and QoL of MS patients.</p></list-item></list><p><bold>Methods:</bold> A total of 63 subjects with MS and 109 subjects without MS were examined with the <italic>BDI</italic>, the <italic>BSI</italic> (anxiety subscale), the Stanford Presenteeism Scale and the subscale of Fatigue of <italic>Hamburg Quality of Life Questionnaire in Multiple Sclerosis</italic>.

Hence, QoL can be increased toward more efficient HR practices, enhanced work designs and more flexible schedules, promoting a better balance between family and work-life. Our results also showed that MS has no significant impact on productivity as a physical health problem. Despite this, there is evidence that depression is the higher predictor of lower QoL in MS patients, whereas anxiety is the most significant predictor for subjects without MS. According to our study, the strategy for both groups must be different, considering depression is the main factor for the MS patients, whereas anxiety is the critical variable for subjects without MS.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section64-1352458514546077"><title>P032</title><sec id="section65-1352458514546077"><title>Patterns of use of tests to monitor disease activity among patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis in the United States and Europe</title><p><underline>P O&#x02019;Meara</underline><sup>1</sup>, S Narayanan<sup>2</sup>, J White<sup>3</sup>, J Chan<sup>3</sup>, S Gabriele<sup>3</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Ipsos Healthcare, New York, NY, United States, <sup>2</sup>Ipsos Healthcare, Columbia, MD, United States, <sup>3</sup>Ipsos Healthcare, London, United Kingdom</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Progression of symptoms among Relapsing Remitting Multiple Sclerosis (RRMS) patients (pts) may necessitate active disease management (DM).

Healthcare providers (HCPs; 94% neurologists) were screened for duration of practice (&#x0003e;=3yrs) and pt volume (&#x0003e;=15 MS pts/month (mo.)) and recruited from a large panel to be geographically representative in each country. Medical charts of next 10 consecutive MS pts were selected by each HCP. RRMS pt data was analyzed.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> 2433 eligible RRMS pt charts were abstracted by 365 HCPs (EU/US: N-265/100; mean neurology practice duration-17/21yrs; mean # of pts seen per month-66/62). In EU/US, pt mean age: 37/41yrs, female: 67%/70%, currently treated: 85%/88%, currently with mild:moderate:severe disease: 60%:34%:5%/67%:29%:3%.

For a more reliable and sensitive assessment of disability in multiple sclerosis (MS) we are developing the ASSESS-MS system, which relies on the automated image analysis algorithm of defined recorded movements. To validate a more sensitive tool, a method to capture clinical judgement in a more discriminatory manner than ordinal scales is required. Therefore, we investigate the ability of experienced neurologists to evaluate motor dysfunction in MS patients via video-based paired comparisons.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To assess whether video-based paired comparisons of patient movements allow a reliable and finer-grained capture of clinical judgment of motor dysfunction in MS, than commonly used measurement instruments.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Thirteen experienced neurologists were presented with pairs of video recordings of MS patients (EDSS 1-7) performing standardized movements like the finger nose test (FNT) and movements based on activities of daily living (ADL), such as drinking from a cup. The clinicians were asked to compare patients&#x02019; performance, evaluating as worse, equal or &#x02018;judgement not possible, because of confounding factors&#x02019;. The pairwise comparisons were evaluated and mapped onto a continuous scale using the Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) model, a commonly applied model in the analysis of paired comparison data. The results were analysed for intra- an interrater reliability and were correlated with the matching EDSS subscores.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The paired gradings were significantly correlated with the matching subscores (e.g. Kendall&#x02019;s tau for FNT was 0.5 with p&#x0003c; 0.01) and allowed to discriminate between patients, even in those with the same EDSS subscore. Internal reliability, which characterizes rater consistency, was above 90%, and short-term test-retest reliability was ~90%. Further results will be presented.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Paired comparisons of video-captured defined movements of MS patients appear to reliably capture neurological judgment of motor dysfunction.

The final decision on the correct scores remains with the physician who can overrule the algorithm. Here we compared results obtained with the standardized EDSS paper-version (pEDSS) and the eEDSS.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Three certified EDSS raters who received training in the use of the eEDSS examined 100 MS patients with varying degrees of neurological deficits. Each patient was assessed twice. The first rater began with using the pEDSS and then switched to the eEDSS after seeing a third of the study population. In parallel the second EDSS rater assessed the same patients an the same day using the eEDSS and switched accordingly. The same principle was used for the third EDSS rater. pEDSS and eEDSS were compared for the frequency of inconsistencies in the assignment of the FS, AS and EDSS, using generalized mixed-effects-models and the exact McNemar-test.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Inconsistencies in FS assessments where much more likely to occur when pEDSS was used compared to eEDSS (OR [95% CI] = 2.538 [1.397 - 4.613]).

For all patients a standardized EDSS-assessment, Nine-Hole-Peg-Test, and the Symbol Digit Modalities Test were performed and documented. Movement information was extracted directly from the depth sensor recordings, pre-processed and analysed by the bespoke automated image analysis algorithm. The built-in skeleton algorithm was not used.

Each movement was correctly classified with a Dice score of at least 80%, supporting the validity of the approach. Average sensitivity/specificity scores were 80-90%. The bespoke automated image analysis algorithm identified movement properties with highest discriminative power, which may help facilitate training of neurologists.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The infrared depth sensor recording technique with bespoke automated image analysis algorithm enables a reliable and sensitive quantitative assessment of motor dysfunction in MS patients.

We will compare test scores of the ST with those of the 9HPT in patients and examine the reliability of the ST results in a test-retest group.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Both tests were performed, according to the MSFC manual, by a group of 37 MS patients, a matched control group of 18 healthy volunteers and a group of 49 healthy test-retest (TRT) controls. The MS patients were divided into groups according to their Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score. EDSS scores ranged from 3-8.</p><p>Statistical analyses were performed in R and MATLAB.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The 9HPT scores showed low to high correlation with the ST scores. Correlation was equal to 0.63, 0.50 and 0.28 (p&#x0003c; 0.0001, p=0.034 &#x00026; p=0.05) for the patient, control and TRT groups respectively. In the total group of 104 subjects, correlation was high (r=0.84, p&#x0003c; 0.0001), and moderate in a group consisting of only the 67 healthy volunteers (r=0.51, p&#x0003c; 0.0001).</p><p>The 49 TRT controls were re-evaluated with the ST within four weeks of the first assessment. The correlation between these two measures was good (r=0.67, p&#x0003c; 0.0001). The average difference between the two measurements was 11.5 % &#x000b1; 10.2 of the baseline value.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The ST is a reliable test of hand function. It is a brief and easy to administer paper-and pencil-test that can be used in a broad EDSS range. It has a high test-retest correlation, and correlates highly with the 9HPT. The ST is simpler and shorter to perform than the 9HPT, and it is more closely related to daily activities like writing. In addition, no material apart from pen and paper is needed, and a record of the test is easily kept. Therefore the ST is a candidate to be used in composite measures of MS related functional deficits for clinical practice and trials.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section75-1352458514546077"><title>P037</title><sec id="section76-1352458514546077"><title>Influence of method of analysis on responsiveness to change of an IRT score of global disability derived from NARCOMS performance scales</title><p><underline>E Chamot</underline><sup>1</sup>, AR Salter<sup>2</sup>, I Kister<sup>3</sup>, GR Cutter<sup>2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>University of Alabama at Birmingham, Epidemiology, Birmingham, AL, United States, <sup>2</sup>University of Alabama at Birmingham, Biostatistics, Birmingham, AL, United States, <sup>3</sup>New York University, Neurology, New York, NY, United States</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> We recently used item response theory (IRT) methodology to derive a patient-reported scale of global neurological disability from North American Research Committee on Multiple Sclerosis (NARCOMS) Performance Scales (PS). In a cross-sectional setting, the IRT scale was found superior to the traditional sum scale. In a longitudinal context, changes on several external measures of disease activity and progression were associated with changes in IRT-estimated PS score that were in the expected directions, but rather small.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To determine the extent to which a &#x0201c;latent change&#x0201d; one-step statistical analysis strategy (direct longitudinal IRT modelling of observed responses to PS across occasions) and the &#x0201c;conventional&#x0201d; two-step strategy (estimation of IRT scores from patients&#x02019; responses to the PS at each occasion, followed by separate conventional longitudinal analysis of score estimates) yield different estimates of responsiveness in PS IRT score when comparing changes on the new measure with changes on external anchor measures, including (1) self-evaluation of change in overall MS symptoms since last survey; (2) employment status; and (3) Patient Determined Disease Steps (PDDS).</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Each single-item PS assess perceived disability in 1 of 11 neurological domains. Conventional and latent change analyses of responsiveness assessed associations between within-person changes on the anchors and changes in PS IRT score. Participants were NARCOMS volunteers enrolled in 2003-2008 who had at least a follow-up immediately after enrollment and at 5 years of follow-up. Data consisted of the first three consecutive biannual updates that assessed the particular anchor of interest.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Sample size ranged from 1435 persons (employment status analysis) to 2207 persons (PDDS analysis). Cohen&#x02019;s d effect sizes expressed in fraction of baseline PS IRT score variance were consistently much larger when estimated with the latent change approach than with the conventional approach. For instance effect size for &#x0201c;worse/much worse symptoms since last survey&#x0201d; was +0.22 (95% CI, +0.13, +0.31) with the former approach and +0.05 (95% CI, +0.01, +0.08) with the latter approach. Response shift did not play any role in these differences.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> In this study, direct IRT modeling prevented bias known to occur with conventional two-step analysis strategy. Our finding may apply to analysis of other MS outcomes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section77-1352458514546077"><title>P038</title><sec id="section78-1352458514546077"><title>Assessment of upper extremity function using the manual dexterity component of the multiple sclerosis performance test: validation of novel metrics</title><p><underline>F Bethoux</underline><sup>1</sup>, D Schindler<sup>2</sup>, J Alberts<sup>2</sup>, D Miller<sup>1</sup>, S Rao<sup>3</sup>, J-C Lee<sup>4</sup>, D Stough<sup>1</sup>, C Reece<sup>3</sup>, B Mamone<sup>1</sup>, R Rudick<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Cleveland Clinic, Mellen Center for MS Treatment and Research, Cleveland, OH, United States, <sup>2</sup>Cleveland Clinic, Biomedical Engineering, Cleveland, OH, United States, <sup>3</sup>Cleveland Clinic, Center for Brain Health, Cleveland, OH, United States, <sup>4</sup>Cleveland Clinic, Quantitative Health Sciences, Cleveland, OH, United States</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Impairment of upper extremity (UE) function is a frequent consequence of multiple sclerosis (MS). The MS Performance Test (MSPT) is an Ipad<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>-based neurological performance assessment tool designed to simulate the MS Functional Composite (MSFC). The 9-Hole Peg Test (9-HPT) assesses UE function within the MSFC. The Manual Dexterity Test (MDT) is the component of the MSPT simulating the 9-HPT. Preliminary data showed that the MDT demonstrates favorable psychometric characteristics compared to the 9-HPT. The MDT allows the computation of novel metrics, in addition to the total time needed to complete the test.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To explore the performance characteristics of novel metrics derived from the MDT.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> The 9-HPT and the MDT were administered in MS patients (MS) and age- and gender-matched healthy controls (HC) during two sessions on the same day. Two modalities of the MDT were used: &#x0201c;Dish MDT&#x0201d; (the 9 pegs are removed one by one from a dish and returned to the dish), and &#x0201c;Row MDT&#x0201d; (the pegs are removed from a row and returned to a dish). Novel metrics on the MDT included the total peg insertion time, total peg removal time, and peg-to-peg variability during insertion and removal (coefficient of variation=CV). The Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) and MS Performance Scales (MSPS) were administered to assess MS-related disability.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> 51 MS (age 46.2(10.1) years, 78.4% women, symptom duration 12.1(9.1) years) and 49 HC subjects (age 45.7(10.7) years, 73.5% women) were included in the analysis. Test-retest reliability was satisfactory (concordance correlation coefficients: 0.721 to 0.953). Both the average insertion and removal times on the Dish and Row MDT differentiated between MS and HC (p 0.003 to &#x0003c; 0.001, Cohen&#x02019;s d 0.65 to 0.93). Peg-to-peg variability was not significantly different between MS and HC. Both the insertion and removal times were strongly correlated with total MDT time and 9-HPT time (Pearson correlation coefficients: 0.71 to 0.93). Patterns of correlation with disease duration, EDSS, and MSPS were comparable to those of the total MDT time and 9-HPT.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> In this cross-sectional study, the insertion and removal times on the MDT exhibited similar performance characteristics to the total MDT time and 9-HPT, suggesting that the test could be reduced to only one phase without compromising its clinical usefulness. Longitudinal studies are needed to confirm these findings.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="section79-1352458514546077"><title>Clinical trials</title><sec id="section80-1352458514546077"><title>P039</title><sec id="section81-1352458514546077"><title>Improvement in MRI outcomes across subgroups with alemtuzumab versus interferon beta-1a in treatment-naive relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis</title><p><underline>X Montalban</underline><sup>1</sup>, DL Arnold<sup>2,3</sup>, E Fisher<sup>4</sup>, DH Margolin<sup>5</sup>, J Palmer<sup>5</sup>, on behalf of the CARE-MS I Investigators</p><p><sup>1</sup>Edifici Cemcat, Vall d&#x02019;Hebron University Hospital and Research Institute, Barcelona, Spain, <sup>2</sup>NeuroRx Research, Montr&#x000e9;al, QC, Canada, <sup>3</sup>Montr&#x000e9;al Neurological Institute, McGill University, Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery, Montr&#x000e9;al, QC, Canada, <sup>4</sup>Cleveland Clinic, Department of Biomedical Engineering, Cleveland, OH, United States, <sup>5</sup>Genzyme, a Sanofi Company, Cambridge, MA, United States</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> In the CARE-MS I (NCT00530348) trial in treatment-naive patients with active relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS), alemtuzumab proved superior to subcutaneous interferon beta-1a (SC IFNB-1a) with respect to relapse rate, reduction in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) lesion activity, and brain volume loss over 2 years.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> Investigate MRI outcomes in CARE-MS I patient subgroups stratified by baseline demographic and disease characteristics.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> In the 24-month, phase 3, head-to-head CARE-MS I study, patients were randomized to receive alemtuzumab 12 mg/day intravenously on 5 days at baseline and on 3 days 12 months later, or SC IFNB-1a 44 &#x000b5;g 3 times weekly. Annual cranial MRI was analyzed blinded to treatment. Treatment effects on gadolinium (Gd)-enhancing, new/enlarging T<sub>2</sub>-hyperintense and new T<sub>1</sub>-hypointense lesions, and brain volume loss (brain parenchymal fraction [BPF] change) over 2 years were analyzed for subgroups stratified by: gender, age, race, geographic region, baseline Gd-enhancing lesion activity, T<sub>2</sub> lesion volume and BPF, highly active disease (&#x02265;2 relapses in the year prior to randomization and &#x02265;1 Gd-enhancing lesion at baseline), baseline Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score, disease duration, and relapses in prior 2 years.

TOPIC (NCT00622700) is a phase 3 study that evaluated the efficacy and safety of teriflunomide in patients with a first clinical episode suggestive of MS and a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan showing &#x02265;2 T2 lesions &#x02265;3 mm in diameter.

MRI scans were performed at screening, 12, 24, 48, 72, and 108 weeks, and were processed at a central MRI analysis center. Patients treated with teriflunomide 14 mg were analyzed by the following subgroups: gender, age (&#x0003c; or &#x02265;31 years), baseline total lesion volume (TLV; &#x0003c; or &#x02265;5 mL), and baseline number of gadolinium (Gd)-enhancing lesions (0 or &#x02265;1).</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Baseline characteristics were well balanced across the treatment groups; the mean TLV was 8.66 mL and 31.4% of patients had at least one Gd-enhancing lesion.

The benefits of teriflunomide 14-mg treatment on the number of Gd-enhancing lesions per scan were consistent across all subgroups. The positive effects on TLV were observed in subgroups of teriflunomide-treated patients defined by age, baseline TLV, and number of Gd-enhancing lesions at baseline.

LAQ reduced whole brain atrophy rate in both the ALLEGRO and BRAVO phase III trials, as well as gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) atrophy rates in the ALLEGRO trial.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> This study investigated the treatment effect of LAQ on the rates of GM and WM atrophy in the BRAVO trial.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> RRMS patients were randomized to LAQ, intramuscular interferon beta-1a (IFN), or placebo (PLC). The percent change in GM and WM volumes on MRI were measured at year 1 and year 2 with respect to baseline using pairwise Jacobian integration (PJI). PJI nonlinearly aligns a pair of scans from baseline and follow-up and calculates the mean Jacobian determinants of the deformation field, which represent atrophy or growth at each voxel. We calculated the treatment effect as the difference in the unadjusted means between the active and PLC arms divided by the mean PLC value. For p-values, we used ANCOVA with baseline covariates of categorical Gadolinium-enhancing lesion counts (&#x02265;1 or 0), T2 lesion volume, and corresponding normalized tissue volume. The rate in the second year was calculated from year 1 and 2 values.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The unadjusted mean (SD) percent changes in GM volume from baseline to year 1 were -0.609 (0.829) for PLC (n=383), -0.797 (0.859) for IFN (n=396), and -0.298 (0.774) for LAQ (n=371), and from baseline to year 2 were -1.196 (0.902), -1.340 (0.988), and -0.865 (0.940) for PLC, IFN, and LAQ, respectively. Similarly, WM mean (SD) percent changes were -0.452 (0.921), -0.542 (1.171), and -0.274 (1.020) for year 1; and for year 2, -0.793 (1.310), -0.954 (1.445), and -0.670 (1.311) for PLC, IFN, and LAQ, respectively.</p><p>There was a significant treatment effect of LAQ on GM atrophy (51% at year 1 and 28% at year 2, both p&#x0003c; 0.001) compared with PLC. The IFN group showed worsening of 31% (p=0.004) at year 1 and 12% at year 2 (p=0.075). The treatment effect of LAQ on WM atrophy was 39% (p=0.001) at year 1 and 15% (p=0.015) at year 2, compared with PLC. The IFN group was not statistically different from PLC in WM rates at year 1 (p=0.488) and year 2 (p=0.239).

In CARE-MS II (NCT00548405), alemtuzumab had superior efficacy compared with subcutaneous interferon beta-1a (SC IFNB-1a), with manageable safety. Alemtuzumab-treated patients had significant improvements in multiple aspects of quality of life (QoL) from baseline (BL) to Year 2, and QoL scores were significantly higher than those of the SC IFNB-1a arm.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To examine QoL outcomes at Year 3 in alemtuzumab-treated patients who relapsed on a prior therapy.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> CARE-MS II was a 2-year, phase 3 trial in patients with RRMS who relapsed on prior therapy. Patients randomized to alemtuzumab 12 mg/day received intravenous infusions on 5 consecutive days at BL and on 3 consecutive days 12 months later. Patients could be retreated as-needed with alemtuzumab in an ongoing extension study (NCT00930553). QoL was measured every 6 months using the following instruments: Functional Assessment of Multiple Sclerosis (FAMS; scale 0-176 for total score); Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Survey (SF-36; scale 1-100; healthy population mean=50; administered annually in the core study); and EuroQol in 5 Dimensions visual analog scale (EQ-5D VAS; scale 0-100). Higher scores represent better QoL. Change from BL was analyzed by the Wilcoxon one-sample signed rank test. Worsening and improvement on the SF-36 physical component summary (PCS) and mental component summary (MCS) were defined as a &#x02265;5-point decrease and increase from BL, respectively.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> 435 patients were treated with alemtuzumab 12 mg in the core study, 393 entered the extension study, and 80 received alemtuzumab re-treatment. FAMS total score was significantly improved from BL to Year 3 (119.1 vs 124.8; p&#x0003c; 0.0001), with significant improvements on 5 of 6 subscales. Mean SF-36 PCS score rose from BL to Year 3 (42.7 vs 44.7; p&#x0003c; 0.0001) as did mean MCS score (44.9 vs 46.5; p=0.042), corresponding with improvements on 6 of 8 SF-36 subscales. Compared with BL, Year 3 PCS and MCS scores were stable or improved in 82% and 73% of patients, respectively. Mean EQ-5D VAS was also improved from BL to Year 3 (70.1 vs 73.0; p=0.0045).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Overall sustained improvement in physical, mental, and emotional aspects of QoL were observed through 3 years in alemtuzumab-treated patients who relapsed on a prior therapy, even though most patients received only 2 alemtuzumab treatment courses.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section92-1352458514546077"><title>P045</title><sec id="section93-1352458514546077"><title>Larger treatment effects in early multiple sclerosis: a meta analysis of randomized trials</title><p><underline>A Signori</underline><sup>1</sup>, MP Sormani<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>University of Genoa, Health Sciences, Section of Biostatistics, Genoa, Italy</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> In recent years post-hoc analyses of clinical trials were conducted to determine the efficacy of disease-modifying treatments in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) across specific patient subgroups. However, single clinical trials are not powered to detect subgroups specific treatment effects, and no baseline factors emerged in previous analyses indicating subgroups of patients with higher treatment effects.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To evaluate whether there are subgroups of relapsing-remitting (RR) MS patients that are more responsive to treatments taking advantage of the increased power coming from a meta analytic approach.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> We systematically searched all published randomized clinical trials in RRMS reporting a subgroup analysis, that is, an assessment of the treatment effect in different subgroups of patients defined according to baseline characteristics (sex, age, baseline Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), relapse history, previous treatments, presence of Gadolinium enhancing lesions (Gd+) and T2 lesion volume on the baseline MRI scan). Treatment effect was assessed on two endpoints: the annualized relapse-rate (ARR) and the disability progression according to sustained increase of EDSS score. The analysis was made independent from the specific overall treatment effect size by rescaling the treatment effect in each subgroup to the overall treatment effect size, and reporting the subgroup effect as a relative contribution to the treatment specific effect. The subgroup specific treatment effects were combined in a meta-analysis weighted by the inverse of variance.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Six trials including a total of 6693 RRMS patients were included in the meta-analysis. Pooled treatment effects on ARR resulted to be significantly higher in younger subjects (p&#x0003c; 0.0001), in patients with lower baseline EDSS (p=0.013), in patients with baseline Gd+ activity (p&#x0003c; 0.001) and with a trend for patients with high T2 lesion load (p=0.091). A similar scenario was detected for pooled effects on disability progression with an higher effect in younger patients (p = 0.015) and in patients with baseline Gd+ activity (p = 0.019). For both endpoints no differences of treatment effect were detected among groups defined by different gender, relapse history or history of previous treatment.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> This study shows in a formal way that in RRMS, higher treatment effects are associated to characteristics of an earlier (age and EDSS) and more active (Gd+ and T2 activity) disease.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section94-1352458514546077"><title>P046</title><sec id="section95-1352458514546077"><title>Evaluating the effect of teriflunomide in subgroups defined by prior treatment: pooled analyses of the phase 3 TEMSO and TOWER studies</title><p><underline>MS Freedman</underline><sup>1</sup>, D Dukovic<sup>2</sup>, M Benamor<sup>3</sup>, P Truffinet<sup>3</sup>, L Kappos<sup>4</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>University of Ottawa and the Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, Ottawa, ON, Canada, <sup>2</sup>Sanofi, Bridgewater, NJ, United States, <sup>3</sup>Genzyme, a Sanofi Company, Chilly-Mazarin, France, <sup>4</sup>University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Teriflunomide is a once-daily oral immunomodulator approved for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS). The TEMSO (NCT00134563) and TOWER (NCT00751881) phase 3 studies had similar designs and patient populations that allowed data pooling. In the main pooled analyses, teriflunomide 14 mg significantly reduced annualized relapse rate (ARR) and risk of disability progression vs placebo; the 7-mg dose significantly reduced ARR. The two teriflunomide doses had similar, manageable safety profiles. Pre-trial use of disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) may suggest higher baseline disease activity in some study patients.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To assess the consistency of teriflunomide treatment effect on ARR and disability progression across patient subgroups defined by prior MS treatment.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Adult patients with relapsing forms of MS (N=2251) were randomized 1:1:1 to receive teriflunomide 14 mg, 7 mg, or placebo, for 108 weeks (TEMSO) or for 48 weeks after the last patient randomized (TOWER). Post hoc pooled analyses of ARR and 12-week confirmed disability progression were performed according to patient subgroups defined by prior MS treatment: &#x0003e;1 prior DMT; 1 prior DMT; and no prior DMT.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Baseline characteristics were generally well balanced among treatment groups. Mean time since diagnosis of MS ranged from 4.4 years (no prior DMT) to 7.3 years (&#x0003e;1 prior DMT). Mean time since most recent relapse ranged from 5.6 months (no prior DMT) to 6.4 months (&#x0003e;1 prior DMT).</p><p>Teriflunomide 14 mg generally demonstrated efficacy vs placebo across the patient subgroups for ARR and risk of disability progression; there were no significant treatment-by-subgroup interactions. Relative risk reductions for ARR with teriflunomide 14 mg vs placebo were 46.7%, 27.7%, and 35.9% for &#x0003e;1 prior DMT, 1 prior DMT, and no prior DMT, respectively; corresponding hazard rate reductions for risk of disability progression were 78.6%, 46.6%, and 17.4%. A more robust effect was observed on disability progression with teriflunomide 14 mg versus teriflunomide 7 mg, whereas similar results were observed on ARR with both doses.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> These pooled subgroup analyses show a consistent treatment effect of teriflunomide 14 mg across subgroups defined by pre-trial therapy, and confirm the clinical efficacy of teriflunomide.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section96-1352458514546077"><title>P047</title><sec id="section97-1352458514546077"><title>The effects of age and gender on brain volume in FREEDOMS, FREEDOMS II and TRANSFORMS phase 3 studies</title><p><underline>E-W Radue</underline><sup>1</sup>, JS Wolinsky<sup>2</sup>, D Tomic<sup>3</sup>, DA H&#x000e4;ring<sup>3</sup>, P Chin<sup>4</sup>, F Barkhof<sup>5</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>University Hospital Basel, Medical Image Analysis Centre, Basel, Switzerland, <sup>2</sup>University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, Department of Neurology, Houston, TX, United States, <sup>3</sup>Novartis Pharma AG, Basel, Switzerland, <sup>4</sup>Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, East Hanover, NJ, United States, <sup>5</sup>VU Medical Centre, Image Analysis Centre, Amsterdam, Netherlands</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Analysis of brain volume (BV) in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) in fingolimod clinical trials revealed relationships between variables such as MRI lesions, disability progression and whole BV change, but few studies of large datasets have examined the impact of age and gender on BV loss in RRMS.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To examine the effect of age and gender on normalized BV (NBV) at baseline (BL) and on percentage BV change (PBVC) from BL to end of study (EOS) across the three phase 3 trials of fingolimod (2-year FREEDOMS and FREEDOMS II; 1-year TRANSFORMS).</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> &#x02018;Structural Image Evaluation, using Normalization, of Atrophy&#x02019; (SIENA) was used to assess PBVC from BL to EOS, and cross-sectionally at BL (SIENAX) to assess NBV. In a statistical model selection process using multiple regression models, the independent associations of several BL variables with NBV and PBVC were tested. For NBV, these variables were: age; gender; duration of MS; number of relapses 1 or 2 years before the study; disability score (Expanded Disability Status Scale [EDSS] or MS Functional Composite [MSFC]); Gd+ lesion count; T2 lesion volume; and T1-hypointense lesion volume. The same variables and NBV were tested as covariates for PBVC, with treatment as a fixed variable. Variables were ranked by importance in each trial, and the highest ranking were used to define the final model, if selected in all three trials.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Age correlated most strongly with NBV across the three trials, closely followed by BL T2 lesion volume. Disability score (MSFC or EDSS) and duration of MS also correlated with NBV. NBV was slightly greater in women than men in FREEDOMS (respectively, 1518.3 cm<sup>3</sup> vs 1505.8 cm<sup>3</sup>; <italic>p</italic>=0.0167) and FREEDOMS II (1530.3 cm<sup>3</sup> vs 1493.5 cm<sup>3</sup>; <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c; 0.001), but not in TRANSFORMS (1526.4 cm<sup>3</sup> vs 1524.3 cm<sup>3</sup>; <italic>p</italic>=0.6592); gender was excluded from the final regression model because of its poor rank across trials. Age and gender did not predict PBVC in any trial. The best BL predictors of PBVC were treatment, T2 lesion volume and Gd+ lesion count.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Age, T2 lesion burden, MS disease duration and disability status were important determinants of NBV. Between-gender differences in BV were minimized by the normalization process in SIENAX; at BL, NBV was similar in men and women. Regardless of age, men and women were equally affected by BV loss. Compared with controls, fingolimod treatment reduced BV loss in all three studies irrespective of age or gender.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section98-1352458514546077"><title>P048</title><sec id="section99-1352458514546077"><title>Follow-up data from the Mirror study: a dose-ranging study of subcutaneous ofatumumab in subjects with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis</title><p><underline>PS Sorenson</underline><sup>1</sup>, ST Kavanagh<sup>2</sup>, DJ Austin<sup>3</sup>, RA Grove<sup>4</sup>, MC Lopez<sup>5</sup>, JM Tolson<sup>6</sup>, SA Van Meter<sup>7</sup>, A Bar-Or<sup>8</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Copenhagen University Hospital, Rigshospitalet, Department of Neurology, Copenhagen, Denmark, <sup>2</sup>GlaxoSmithKline, Clinical Statistics, Neurosciences, Research Triangle Park, NC, United States, <sup>3</sup>GlaxoSmithKline, Clinical Pharmacology, Stockley Park West, United Kingdom, <sup>4</sup>GlaxoSmithKline, Clinical Statistics, Neurosciences, Stockley Park West, United Kingdom, <sup>5</sup>GlaxoSmithKline, Stiefel Global Clinical Dev US, Research Triangle Park, NC, United States, <sup>6</sup>GlaxoSmithKline, RD Projects Clinical Platforms &#x00026; Sciences, Research Triangle Park, NC, United States, <sup>7</sup>GlaxoSmithKline, Neurosciences Therapy Area Unit, Research Triangle Park, NC, United States, <sup>8</sup>McGill University and McGill University Health Center, Montreal Neurological Institute and Hospital, Montreal, QC, Canada</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Studies have demonstrated the benefits of anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody treatments in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). This study investigated the safety and efficacy of four subcutaneous ofatumumab (OFA) dosing regimens in subjects with RRMS.

At week 12, the end of the PBO-controlled phase, the PBO group received a single OFA 3mg dose.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> 231 subjects received at least one dose of treatment. Of these, 221 (96%) subjects entered the 24-week follow-up phase; 212 (92%) subjects completed and 9 (4%) subjects prematurely withdrew. The most common reason for withdrawal was withdrawal of consent.</p><p>During the 24-week follow-up phase, the most common adverse events (AEs) were related to infections, observed in 25% of subjects across treatment groups. There was no evidence of a relationship between dose and the incidence or severity of AEs. Twelve serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported by 9 subjects with no SAE reported by more than one subject; no cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy or opportunistic infections were observed.</p><p>Assessment of efficacy data showed that the MRI lesion suppression seen during the 24-week treatment phase persisted through week 48 for the OFA treatment groups. As of the week 48 visit (equivalent to 36 weeks post-last dose for all groups except 60mg q4w, for which it was 28 weeks post-last dose), B-cell repletion (defined as &#x02265; baseline level or &#x02265; 0.11 GI/L) had been achieved by 46% of PBO/3mg-treated subjects, 35% of 3mg q12w-treated subjects, 40% of 30mg q12w-treated subjects, 33% of 60mg q12w-treated subjects, and 19% of 60mg q4w-treated subjects.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> These results support further study of the safety and efficacy of OFA in longer term studies in subjects with RRMS.

Boswellic acids (BAs), the main biologically active compound of frankincense, are orally available and known to exhibit anti-inflammatory activities. Clinical trials with frankincense extracts in rheumatoid arthritis showed very good tolerability and good efficacy in restraining inflammation, while the effect of BAs in RR-MS is unknown so far.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> We perform a Phase IIa bicentric open-label baseline-to-treatment study with the standardized frankincense extract BOSWELAN&#x000ae; to test the safety, tolerability and efficacy of BAs in RR-MS patients.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> The study is conducted under GCP. One major inclusion criteria is the presence of at least 2 new Gadolinium-enhancing (Gd+) lesions in monthly MRI during a 3-month screening phase. Treatment is initiated by an individualized dose finding to identify the highest well tolerated BOSWELAN&#x000ae; dose for each patient. Primary outcome is the number of new Gd+ lesions in monthly MRIs between months 5 and 8 of the treatment phase compared to 4 screening MRIs.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> 80 patients were screened at two centers to include 37 patients in the SABA trial. 6 patients terminated early due to non-compliance with the study protocol (n=3) or did start licensed immunotherapy because of relapse activity (n=3). Until now 23 patients have reached the primary endpoint of the treatment phase (month 8). Boswellic acids were very well tolerated at the highest dose of 4800mg per day which is the treatment dose for the majority of study patients (87%). There were no changes of laboratory parameters, in particular no changes in blood cell counts or liver enzymes due to the intake of BAs. Adverse events (AEs) were primarily mild (59% of all AEs) or moderate (39% of all AEs) and comprised predominantly gastrointestinal symptoms within the first four weeks (dose escalation phase). These declined almost completely to baseline frequencies afterwards. MRI disease activity was reduced by 63,8% in the number of new Gd+ lesions and by 62,4% in the number of new T2 lesions between screening and treatment phase (p &#x0003c; 0.05).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Up to now BOSWELAN shows a very good safety profile and high patient acceptance.

Data from a total of 490 individuals from 6 phase I studies in HVs and 1 placebo-controlled phase II study in patients with relapsing-remitting MS were split into two datasets for model building (five studies) and qualification (two studies). Inter-individual variability (IIV) was defined as log-normal distribution and residual variability as additive. Covariates tested were weight, age, gender, MS (yes/no) and ethnicity. Qualification of the model involved multiple levels of scrutiny; starting by standard goodness of fit and including assessment of the predictability of the model on the building dataset and on the qualification dataset.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> This PK/PD modeling approach characterizes the effect of siponimod on lymphocytes dynamics. The maximal effect was estimated at 83% inhibition (I-max). The concentration necessary to reach 50% of the maximal effect (IC50) was estimated at 4.86 ng/ml.

In Weeks 1&#x02212;4, in the bismuth subsalicylate vs the placebo group, the incidence of overall GI events was 69.3% vs 68.6% and of acute GI events was 70.5% vs 68.2%; these rates are comparable to those seen in a previous study employing daily prompted self-report of GI events. The incidences of flatulence (38.6% vs 50.6%) and diarrhea (36.4% vs 48.2%) were lower in the bismuth subsalicylate group vs the placebo group, as were the mean worst severity scores for flatulence (1.1 vs 1.8; LS mean difference [95% CI]: 0.7 [0.1, 1.3]) and diarrhea (1.0 vs 1.6; LS mean difference [95% CI]: 0.6 [0.0, 1.2]. Percentages of subjects reporting worst severity scores of &#x0201c;severe&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;extreme&#x0201d; were lower in the bismuth subsalicylate group vs the placebo group for flatulence (severe, 1.1% vs 5.9%; extreme, 0% vs 0%), diarrhea (severe, 1.1% vs 9.4%; extreme, 0% vs 0%), upper abdominal pain (severe, 0% vs 8.2%; extreme, 0% vs 1.2%), indigestion (severe, 0% vs 3.5%; extreme, 0% vs 1.2%), and vomiting (severe, 1.1% vs 1.2%; extreme, 0% vs 1.2%). The duration of and percentage of days with individual acute GI events were comparable between groups.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Coadministration of bismuth subsalicylate with delayed-release DMF significantly reduced the severity and numerically reduced the incidence of flatulence and diarrhea.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section108-1352458514546077"><title>P053</title><sec id="section109-1352458514546077"><title>Comparable clinical and MRI efficacy of glatiramer acetate 40mg/mL TIW and 20mg/mL QD: results of a systematic review and meta-analysis</title><p><underline>G Cutter</underline><sup>1</sup>, JS Wolinsky<sup>2</sup>, G Comi<sup>3</sup>, D Ladkani<sup>4</sup>, V Knappertz<sup>5,6</sup>, A Vainstein<sup>7</sup>, N Sasson<sup>7</sup>, O Khan<sup>8,9</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL, United States, <sup>2</sup>University of Texas, Health Science Center at Houston, Houston, TX, United States, <sup>3</sup>San Raffaele Scientific Institute and Vita-Salute San Raffaele University, Milan, Italy, <sup>4</sup>Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, Petach Tiqva, Israel, <sup>5</sup>Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, Frazer, PA, United States, <sup>6</sup>Heinrich-Heine Universit&#x000e4;t D&#x000fc;sseldorf, D&#x000fc;sseldorf, Germany, <sup>7</sup>Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, Netanya, Israel, <sup>8</sup>Multiple Sclerosis Center, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, MI, United States, <sup>9</sup>Sastry Foundation Advanced Imaging Laboratory, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, MI, United States</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> The GALA study in RRMS showed the safety and efficacy of glatiramer acetate (GA; Teva Pharmaceutical Ind.) 40mg 3 times weekly (TIW) vs. placebo (PBO). A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed to generate a robust estimate of the treatment effects of GA 20mg once-daily (QD) from PBO-controlled studies, and indirectly compare them with those of GA 40mg TIW.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To assess the comparability of the GA 40mg TIW and GA 20mg QD efficacy profiles.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> A systematic review for meta-analysis resulted in four eligible PBO-controlled studies with GA 20mg QD. Individual and aggregated meta-analyses to reach an overall estimate of GA 20mg QD treatment effect on annualized relapse rate (ARR) and number of new T2 lesions were performed. Risk ratios (RRs) from individual patient data were determined by negative binomial regression with treatment, baseline EDSS score, and number of relapses in the 2 years before entry as fixed effects, and study as a random effect in the model. A study-by-treatment interaction term was also included. For aggregate analyses, RRs were estimated using inverse variance for fixed effects and DerSimonian and Laird method for random effect. Statistical adjustments/weighting were used to account for differences in study designs, sizes, and drug exposure. The RRs for GA 20mg QD vs. PBO were descriptively compared with RRs for GA 40mg TIW vs. PBO in GALA for the same endpoints.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> GA 20mg QD showed ARR reductions of 28% vs. PBO in pooled individual patient data (RR=0.72, 95%CI 0.56, 0.93; <italic>p</italic>=.0112) and 30% in aggregate data (RR=0.70, 95%CI 0.60, 0.81;</p><p><italic>p</italic>&#x0003c; .0001).

Confidence intervals (CIs) for RRs of GA 20mg QD vs. PBO and GA 40mg TIW vs. PBO on ARR substantially overlapped, indicating similarity of GA 40mg TIW effect to that of GA 20mg QD. GA 20mg QD reduced new T2 lesions by 43% vs. PBO (RR=0.57, 95% CI 0.39, 0.81; <italic>p</italic>=.002) while in GALA, the GA 40mg TIW reduction was 35% (RR=0.65, 95%CI 0.55, 0.78; <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c; .0001).

Cumulative ARR at the end of year 4 was maintained at 0.26. Comparison between patients who entered the extension versus those who terminated the core study early or chose not to continue to the extension (n=95) showed no differences in baseline demographics and disease characteristics. During the extension phase, 28 patients (8.0%) discontinued treatment due to withdrawn consent, and 10 (2.8%) due to an adverse event (AE). Serious AEs occurred in 20 subjects (5.7%), similar to the rate during the core study. Each event was reported in a single subject. Most AEs showed decreased incidence in the extension relative to the core study. An expected decrease in IFN &#x003b2;-1a IM known adverse drug reactions (ADRs) was noted, including thyroid-related (1.4% to 0.3%) and febrile and influenza-like AEs (61.4% to 7.4%). Increases in laquinimod ADRs were noted, including gastrointestinal (9.7% to 12.5%) and musculoskeletal (12.5% to 16.5%), but to a lesser degree when compared with the placebo group during the core study.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> In the ensuing 2 years following the switch from IFN &#x003b2;-1a IM to laquinimod, the ARR remained stable. AEs following the switch showed the expected pattern of reduction in IFN &#x003b2;-1a IM related AEs and increase in laquinimod related AEs, with no new unexpected events.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section112-1352458514546077"><title>P055</title><sec id="section113-1352458514546077"><title>Effects of a very low fat, plant-food-based diet on fatigue in multiple sclerosis: report of a pilot trial</title><p><underline>V Yadav</underline><sup>1,2</sup>, G Maracci<sup>1,2</sup>, E Kim<sup>1,2</sup>, R Spain<sup>1,2</sup>, M Cameron<sup>1,2</sup>, S Overs<sup>3</sup>, A Lewis<sup>1</sup>, J McDougall<sup>4</sup>, J Lovera<sup>5,6</sup>, C Murchison<sup>1</sup>, DN Bourdette<sup>1,2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Oregon Health &#x00026; Science University, Neurology, Portland, OR, United States, <sup>2</sup>Portland Veterans&#x02019; Affairs Medical Center, Neurology, Portland, OR, United States, <sup>3</sup>Novant Medical Group, Charlotte, OR, United States, <sup>4</sup>McDougall Research and Education Foundation, Santa Rosa, CA, United States, <sup>5</sup>Louisiana State University, Neurology, New Orleans, LA, United States, <sup>6</sup>Lsu, Neurology, Neurology, LA, United States</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Despite use of disease modifying therapies, poor quality of life in MS patients can be a significant management issue.

Over a total of 9 months period, two 3 months periods with trial treatment were separated by a wash-out period of 3 months. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01149525.</p><p>Eligible MS patients were affected of fatigue for more than 3 months with global score on Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS)&#x0003e;45%.The primary outcome measure was the global score on the 21 item MFIS. Secondary outcome measures included the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), Fatigue Visual Analogic Scale (VAS), physical dimension scale of MFIS, and the SEP59 Quality Of Life scale (derived from the MSQOL-54, validated in French). Free carnitine and acyl-carnitine serum dosages were scheduled at baseline and at the end of study.

The teriflunomide clinical development program includes four monotherapy placebo-controlled studies. Teriflunomide has consistently demonstrated significant clinical and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) benefits, and has a well-characterized safety profile. With both doses (14 mg and 7 mg), plasma accumulation of teriflunomide occurs slowly, with steady-state levels reached in 3-3.5 months. Analyses of data from the first few months of clinical trials enable estimates of the timing of onset of treatment effects.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To assess the timing of onset of efficacy of teriflunomide through examining the relationships between pharmacodynamic (PD) effects, efficacy, and plasma concentration.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Integrated data from the TEMSO (NCT00134563) and TOWER (NCT00751881) pivotal phase 3 studies were used to model the pharmacokinetic (PK)/PD profile of teriflunomide and assess the relationship of plasma concentration to efficacy. Plots of Nelson-Aalen estimates of mean cumulative relapses over time based on integrated TEMSO/TOWER data were used to observe the timing of onset of the teriflunomide treatment effect on relapse. Data on effect on MRI outcomes were analyzed, as available, from 6 weeks in the phase 2 study (NCT01487096) and from 12 weeks in the TOPIC phase 3 study (NCT00622700). For cell counts, blood samples were taken at randomization, every 2 weeks for 24 weeks, then every 6 weeks until treatment end.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Using the integrated data, PK/PD modeling showed that efficacy of teriflunomide was evident before plasma concentrations reached steady-state levels. Nelson-Aalen estimates of the mean functions for the number of relapses showed early separation of the teriflunomide 14-mg and 7-mg curves and the placebo curve, within 6 weeks of starting treatment. In the phase 2 study, combined unique active lesions (UALs) were reduced at 6 weeks with teriflunomide vs placebo; differences were significant at 12 weeks. In TOPIC, total lesion volume and UALs were reduced at 12 weeks with teriflunomide 14 mg vs placebo. Neutrophil and lymphocyte counts decreased within 6 weeks.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Findings from the teriflunomide clinical development program support the understanding that after initiating treatment, the effects of teriflunomide 14 mg on relapses, MRI outcomes, and laboratory parameters are evident before plasma concentrations have reached steady-state levels.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section120-1352458514546077"><title>P059</title><sec id="section121-1352458514546077"><title>Five-year follow-up of delayed-release dimethyl fumarate in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis: MRI outcomes from DEFINE, CONFIRM, and ENDORSE</title><p><underline>NC Kurukulasuriya</underline><sup>8</sup>, DL Arnold<sup>1,2</sup>, RJ Fox<sup>3</sup>, R Gold<sup>4</sup>, E Havrdova<sup>5</sup>, L Kappos<sup>6</sup>, T Yousry<sup>7</sup>, D MacManus<sup>7</sup>, R Zhang<sup>8</sup>, M Yang<sup>8</sup>, V Viglietta<sup>8</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>NeuroRx Research, Montreal, AB, Canada, <sup>2</sup>Montreal Neurological Institute, McGill University, Montreal, AB, Canada, <sup>3</sup>Mellen Center for Multiple Sclerosis Treatment and Research, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, United States, <sup>4</sup>St. Josef Hospital, Ruhr University, Bochum, Germany, <sup>5</sup>Charles University, Department of Neurology, First Faculty of Medicine, Prague, Czech Republic, <sup>6</sup>University Hospital, Basel Neurology, Basel, Switzerland, <sup>7</sup>University College London Institute of Neurology, Queen Square Multiple Sclerosis Centre, NMR Research Unit, London, United Kingdom, <sup>8</sup>Biogen Idec Inc., Cambridge, MA, United States</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Delayed-release dimethyl fumarate (DMF) demonstrated efficacy and safety in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) in the 2-year, Phase 3 DEFINE and CONFIRM studies.

Patients randomized to placebo (PBO) or glatiramer acetate (GA) were re-randomized 1:1 to delayed-release DMF 240 mg BID or TID.

For patients switching from PBO to delayed-release DMF (PBO/BID), no new/enlarging T2 lesions were observed in 33% of patients during the second year on PBO in DEFINE/CONFIRM and 73% of patients during the second year on delayed-release DMF in ENDORSE.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Reduced frequency of new MRI lesions is maintained over 4 years among patients continuing delayed-release DMF therapy. After switching from PBO to delayed-release DMF, patients demonstrated MRI outcomes similar to those observed with delayed-release DMF in DEFINE/CONFIRM.

Teriflunomide is known to decrease the proliferation of stimulated lymphocytes via inhibition of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase activity that is required for de novo pyrimidine synthesis.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To assess lymphocyte and neutrophil counts in pooled data from the placebo-controlled phase 2 (NCT01487096) and phase 3 TEMSO (NCT00134563), TOWER (NCT00751881), and TOPIC (NCT00622700) studies.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Patients with relapsing MS were randomized to receive once-daily teriflunomide 14 mg (n=1002), 7 mg (n=1045), or placebo (n=997). Blood samples were collected at randomization, every 2 weeks for 24 weeks, then every 6 weeks, and at treatment end.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Mean baseline lymphocyte and neutrophil counts were similar across groups. Small reductions in mean lymphocyte/neutrophil counts were seen in patients receiving teriflunomide; mean counts remained within the normal range for most patients (lymphocytes, 1-4x10<sup>9</sup>/L; neutrophils, 2.5-7.5x10<sup>9</sup>/L). Mean (standard deviation [SD]) lymphocyte count reductions at Week 48 were: 14 mg, &#x02212;0.27 (0.45)x10<sup>9</sup>/L; 7 mg, &#x02212;0.20 (0.45)x10<sup>9</sup>/L; placebo, 0.01 (0.50)x10<sup>9</sup>/L. Mean (SD) neutrophil count reductions at Week 48 were: 14 mg, &#x02212;0.66 (1.72)x10<sup>9</sup>/L; 7 mg, &#x02212;0.41 (1.57)x10<sup>9</sup>/L; placebo, &#x02212;0.13 (1.69)x10<sup>9</sup>/L. Decreases in mean values occurred within the first 12 weeks (lymphocytes) or 6 weeks (neutrophils) of treatment and stabilized thereafter. Lymphocyte and neutrophil count decreases returned to normal in the majority of patients before end of treatment. Protocols specified that patients with neutrophil counts &#x0003c; 1x10<sup>9</sup>/L were to discontinue treatment permanently. Eleven (1.1%; 14 mg), eight (0.8%; 7 mg), and one (0.1%; placebo) patients discontinued due to neutropenia or neutrophil count decrease as per the protocol requirement. Neutropenia serious adverse events (SAEs) were infrequent, as reported in seven (0.7%; 14 mg), two (0.2%; 7 mg), and three (0.3%; placebo) patients; there were no lymphopenia SAEs. No evidence of a link between neutrophil or lymphocyte count decreases and infection was observed.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Consistent with results from individual trials, pooled data from four studies of teriflunomide in patients with MS show small, reversible effects on lymphocyte and neutrophil counts. Limited impact on immune cell numbers without an associated increase in infection risk suggests teriflunomide is an immunomodulator with a minimal effect on immunity.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section124-1352458514546077"><title>P061</title><sec id="section125-1352458514546077"><title>Consistent effect of laquinimod on relapse-related and disability progression-related endpoints</title><p><underline>G Comi</underline><sup>1</sup>, TL Vollmer<sup>2</sup>, L Kappos<sup>3</sup>, X Montalban<sup>4</sup>, T Gorfine<sup>5</sup>, N Sasson<sup>5</sup>, V Knappertz<sup>6,7</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>San Raffaele Scientific Institute and Vita-Salute San Raffaele University, Milan, Italy, <sup>2</sup>University of Colorado, Aurora, CO, United States, <sup>3</sup>Clinical Research and Biomedicine, University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland, <sup>4</sup>Hospital Universitari de la Vall d&#x02019;Hebron, Barcelona, Spain, <sup>5</sup>Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, Netanya, Israel, <sup>6</sup>Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, Frazer, PA, United States, <sup>7</sup>Heinrich-Heine Universit&#x000e4;t D&#x000fc;sseldorf, D&#x000fc;sseldorf, Germany</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Once-daily oral laquinimod 0.6mg has demonstrated efficacy in reducing relapse and disability-based outcomes.

POPARTMUS (NTC00127075) was a multicentric, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial of progestin and estradiol, administered immediately after delivery for 12 weeks in 203 women with relapsing MS. Results showed no protective effect of sexual steroids on relapse rate after delivery and on the occurrence of new MRI lesions. Currently very few longitudinal MRI data are available in the MS literature to characterize this particular period in a woman&#x02019;s life.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To describe MRI findings in the 28 women included in the MRI subgroup.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> 28 patients out of 203 underwent the MRI follow-up. Inclusion and randomization took place before the end of the 36<sup>th</sup> week of amenorrhea. Neurologic evaluation and MRI acquisition were scheduled at week 36 of amenorrhea and at weeks 4, 8, 12 and 24 after delivery. MRI scans were assessed by a single neuroradiologist blinded to group treatment and patient ID. The number of active MRI scans was assessed. A follow-up MRI was defined as active if presenting at least one new lesion (eg. new or growing T2 lesions and/or Gadolinium-enhanced T1 lesions (T1Gd) lesions, compared to previous timepoint). The cumulative number of new lesions was measured at each MRI timepoint. The volume of T2 and T1Gd lesions was also reported.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> 18 of the 28 women had at least one active MRI after delivery with no significant difference between treated and placebo groups. Mean cumulative number of new lesions was 21.9 in the treated group and 19.4 in the placebo group at week 12 and 27 vs 24.7 at week 24. Mean cumulative number of T1Gd lesions was 12.7 in the treated group and 8.2 in the placebo group at week 12, and 13.8 vs 10.1 at week 24. Mean volumes of T2 lesions were 10161.6, 9356.7, 9649.1 and 7967.1 mm<sup>3</sup> in the treated group versus 13434.1, 14596.9, 15506.5 and 16312.4 mm<sup>3</sup> in the placebo group at weeks 4, 8, 12 and 24 respectively. Mean volumes of T1Gd lesions were 626.1, 293.7, 251.2 and 28.2 mm<sup>3</sup> in the treated group versus 172.2, 165.1, 126.0 and 133.2 mm<sup>3</sup> in the placebo group at weeks 4, 8, 12 and 24 respectively.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> MRI data confirm the absence of efficacy of sexual steroids in the POPARTMUS study. Nevertheless, this MRI cohort of postpartum MS women is unique and will be further investigated. Pooled post-hoc analysis will include brain atrophy and diffusion-weighted imaging.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section130-1352458514546077"><title>P064</title><sec id="section131-1352458514546077"><title>Long-term efficacy of delayed-release dimethyl fumarate in newly diagnosed patients with RRMS: an integrated analysis of DEFINE, CONFIRM, and ENDORSE</title><p><underline>R Gold</underline><sup>1</sup>, G Giovannoni<sup>2</sup>, JT Phillips<sup>3</sup>, RJ Fox<sup>4</sup>, A Zhang<sup>5</sup>, NC Kurukulasuriya<sup>5</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>St. Josef Hospital, Ruhr University, Bochum, Germany, <sup>2</sup>Queen Mary University of London, Blizard Institute, Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry, London, United Kingdom, <sup>3</sup>Baylor Institute for Immunology Research, Multiple Sclerosis Program, Dallas, TX, United States, <sup>4</sup>Cleveland Clinic, Mellen Center for Multiple Sclerosis Treatment and Research, Cleveland, OH, United States, <sup>5</sup>Biogen Idec Inc., Cambridge, MA, United States</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Delayed-release dimethyl fumarate (DMF) demonstrated efficacy and safety in the 2-year, Phase 3 DEFINE and CONFIRM studies across a broad range of patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS).

Patients randomized to placebo (PBO) or glatiramer acetate (GA) were re-randomized 1:1 to delayed-release DMF 240 mg BID or TID. Efficacy was analyzed (June 12, 2013 cutoff) by treatment arm in the parent study. Only results for delayed-release DMF 240 mg BID in ENDORSE are reported, as this represents the approved maintenance dosage in the United States and European Union. The GA arm was excluded from the parent analysis of newly diagnosed patients in DEFINE and CONFIRM. &#x0201c;Newly diagnosed&#x0201d; was defined as diagnosed within 1 year prior to parent study entry and either treatment naive or previously treated with corticosteroids alone. BID/BID patients remaining on study received at least 4 years of continuous delayed-release DMF treatment (2 years parent study, 2 years ENDORSE); those remaining on study who switched from PBO (PBO/BID) received at least 2 years of delayed-release DMF treatment (ENDORSE only).</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The newly diagnosed population included 144 BID/BID and 85 PBO/BID patients (median [range] treatment duration: 4.1 [0.6-5.7] and 3.9 [0.5-5.6] years, respectively). Over the entire observation period, the annualized relapse rate (ARR) (95% confidence interval [CI]) in the newly diagnosed population was 0.142 (0.11, 0.19) in BID/BID and 0.175 (0.12, 0.26) in PBO/BID. The Kaplan-Meier estimated proportion of patients with confirmed 24-week disability progression (95% CI) was 0.148 (0.07, 0.29) in BID/BID and 0.205 (0.13, 0.31) in PBO/BID.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> After 4 years median follow-up, sustained treatment with delayed-release DMF demonstrated a strong effect on ARR and disability progression in newly diagnosed RRMS patients.

LAQ had a more pronounced effect on indices of underlying neurodegeneration (CDP, brain tissue loss) than on markers of acute inflammation (relapse, new T2 lesions). The extent to which the LAQ mechanism on CDP overlaps with the mechanism for reducing acute inflammatory events is unknown. In a recent <italic>post hoc</italic> analysis, fingolimod treatment (Tx) effect on CDP was substantially (60%) mediated by its effect on relapses in the first study year (Sormani, 2013).</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To determine the proportion of LAQ 0.6mg Tx effects on CDP mediated by its effect on relapse and new T2 lesions.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> From pooled individual pt data in ALLEGRO and BRAVO, CDP (increase of &#x02265;1 EDSS point from baseline [BL] if BL EDSS &#x02264;5, or of &#x02265;0.5 if BL EDSS &#x0003e;5, sustained 3 or 6 months) was assessed by adjusted logistic regression model with BL EDSS and log of the number of relapses in the 2 years before screening as covariates. Numbers of relapses and new T2 lesions in study year 1 were then independently added to the model. The proportion of Tx effect (PTE) on CDP explained by each potential surrogate was assessed using Freedman&#x02019;s formula (1992).

CDP reductions with LAQ vs. PBO were similar after adjusting for new T2 lesions at year 1 (PTE=0%, both 3- and 6-month CDP). In BRAVO, compared with LAQ, IFN&#x003b2;-1a effects were mediated by relapses and new T2 lesions to a greater extent: Relapse PTE was 18% with LAQ vs. 31% with IFN&#x003b2;-1a, and T2 lesion PTE was 0% with LAQ and 36% for IFN&#x003b2;-1a.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> These mediation data suggest that most of the LAQ effect on disability reduction is explained by mechanisms other than suppression of acute inflammation.

Fibrinogen: A small increase in the group mean level of fibrinogen (well below the normal upper limit value) was already demonstrated after the first month of treatment; returned to baseline at month 6 on drug, without further increase during 3 years of follow up. CRP: No differences were noted between placebo and laquinimod treated subjects at any time during study.

EDSS was 4.0-6.5. Main exclusion criteria were steroid therapy, interferon-beta or glatiramer acetate therapy in the last month, or therapy with any other immunosuppressive drugs 6 months prior to enrolment. Patients with cardiac, haematological, renal or psychiatric disease were excluded. The study was a single-centre, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group trial.It was investigator driven. EPO (48000 IU) or placebo was given intravenously 17 times during the first 24 weeks. All patients received Methylprednisolone 1 gr i.v. prior to the first and second dose of EPO / placebo.

EDSS scores were plotted over time for each patient (natalizumab, n=627; placebo, n=315). The area under the EDSS/time curve was calculated (using the trapezoidal rule<sup>1</sup>), then the product of the patient&#x02019;s baseline EDSS score and the trial duration was subtracted from it, the result was defined as the area under the curve (AUC) with units in EDSS years. A positive AUC indicates a net worsening in EDSS over time from baseline; a negative AUC indicates a net improvement. Least squares (LS) mean AUC, adjusted for baseline EDSS, was compared between treatment groups using ANCOVA on rank test. Patient proportions with AUC &#x02265;1.0, &#x02265;1.5, or &#x02265;2.0 EDSS years were compared by Fisher&#x02019;s exact test.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Natalizumab patients had a net improvement in disability over time (-0.15 EDSS years) while placebo had a net worsening (+0.33 EDSS years), as measured by LS mean AUC; the difference (0.48 EDSS years) was highly significant (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c; 0.0001).

Annual cranial MRI were analyzed blinded to treatment. Treatment effects on risk of gadolinium (Gd)-enhancing lesions, new/enlarging T<sub>2</sub>-hyperintense lesions, new T<sub>1</sub>-hypointense lesions, or brain volume loss (brain parenchymal fraction change [BPF]) over 2 years were analyzed for subgroups stratified by: gender, age, race, geographic region, baseline Gd-enhancing lesion activity, T<sub>2</sub> lesion volume, BPF and Expanded Disability Status Scale score, highly active disease (&#x02265;2 relapses in year prior to randomization and &#x02265;1 Gd-enhancing lesion at baseline), disease duration, relapses in prior 2 years, and prior SC IFNB-1a use. Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated by logistic regression (covariate adjustment for baseline Gd-enhancing, T<sub>2</sub> or T<sub>1</sub> lesion count). BPF was analyzed using a ranked ANCOVA model.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> In all examined subgroups, alemtuzumab (n=426) significantly reduced the risk of T<sub>2</sub> lesions (OR range: 0.11-0.37, p&#x0003c; 0.01) and T<sub>1</sub> lesions (0.07-0.33, p&#x0003c; 0.05) vs SC IFNB-1a (n=202) at Month 24. Risk of Gd-enhancing lesions was lower with alemtuzumab in all subgroups, with significant risk reductions (0.19-0.38, p&#x0003c; 0.05) in most. A lower risk of Gd-enhancing,T<sub>2</sub> and T<sub>1</sub> lesions was observed with alemtuzumab vs SC IFNB-1a irrespective of prior SC IFNB-1a use (OR range: 0.20-0.33; all p&#x0003c; 0.005).

However, it is inconvenient and its acute side effects, including insomnia, depression, agitation are undesirable. Both the dose and the dosing frequency can be reduced by incorporating MP in (PEGylated) liposomes, creating a slow-release formulation with reduced systemic toxicity but with similar peripheral efficacy. Moreover, by adding glutathione to the PEGylated liposomes (2B3-201) an enhanced delivery of MP into the brain is achieved, thereby potentially enhancing central activity. Preclinical studies in animal models of MS showed that 2B3-201 had fewer behavioral side effects and a superior efficacy compared to free MP.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> This first-in-human study was designed to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of 2B3-201, including its immune-suppressive effects, as compared to free MP and placebo.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> In this double-blind, 3-way cross over study, 18 healthy male subjects were divided over 3 cohorts and received ascending doses of 2B3-201, active comparator (free MP) or placebo (5% dextrose). MP plasma concentrations, lymphocyte counts, ACTH and fasting glucose were determined, as well as other standard safety parameters at days 0 to 3 and day 7 following each dose. In addition, neurocognitive tests were performed at regular intervals. A safety and PK interim analysis was performed after the completion of cohort 1.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> 2B3-201 was shown to have a plasma half-life of 23 h, compared to a half-life of 3 h for free MP. 2B3-201, at doses of 150 mg, 300 mg and 450 mg, resulted in a similar reduction in the lymphocyte count as 1000 mg of free MP. This effect was sustained considerably longer after 450 mg 2B3-201 administration to &#x0003e;74 h. Similar patterns were observed for a decline in ACTH and a rise in fasting glucose (measured up to 48h). All pharmacodynamic outcome measures had returned to baseline at 7 days after dosing. Furthermore, no signs of CNS side effects or serious AEs were observed with 2B3-201. The AEs were generally mild and self-limiting.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> 2B3-201 at doses up to 450 mg was considered safe. In addition, 2B3-201 shows a long plasma half-life (23h) and immunosuppressive effects that last for at least 3 days. This supports continued development of 2B3-201 as a safe single dose treatment of acute relapses in MS.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section156-1352458514546077"><title>P077</title><sec id="section157-1352458514546077"><title>Lymphocyte count reductions with delayed-release dimethyl fumarate: integrated analysis of the phase 2, phase 3, and extension studies</title><p><underline>RJ Fox</underline><sup>1</sup>, A Chan<sup>2</sup>, R Gold<sup>2</sup>, JT Phillips<sup>3</sup>, K Selmaj<sup>4</sup>, R Zhang<sup>5</sup>, H Yuan<sup>5</sup>, M Novas<sup>5</sup>, V Viglietta<sup>5</sup>, NC Kurukulasuriya<sup>5</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Mellen Center for Multiple Sclerosis Treatment and Research, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, United States, <sup>2</sup>St. Josef Hospital, Ruhr University, Bochum, Germany, <sup>3</sup>Multiple Sclerosis Program, Baylor Institute for Immunology Research, Dallas, TX, United States, <sup>4</sup>Medical University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland, <sup>5</sup>Biogen Idec, Inc., Cambridge, MA, United States</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Delayed-release dimethyl fumarate (DMF) demonstrated efficacy and safety in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis in placebo-controlled clinical trials, including a Phase 2b trial and the Phase 3 DEFINE and CONFIRM studies.

Patients (n=147) completing the 36-week treatment period entered the long-term open-label extension (NCT00228163). Patients either continued with teriflunomide therapy or, for those initially receiving placebo, were re-randomized (1:1) to teriflunomide, 14 mg or 7 mg.

HspB5 fulfills important neuroprotective functions in the central nervous system (CNS), and has a particularly prominent role in limiting oxidative injury. One mechanism through which HspB5 exerts its protective functions is Toll-like receptor 2-mediated activation of regulatory microglia and macrophages. Recent evidence indicates that this protective role of HspB5 can be subverted by HspB5-reactive human memory T cells that enter the CNS during MS, and secrete interferon-gamma (IFN-g) in response to their target. IFN-g subsequently changes the HspB5-induced protective microglial/macrophage response into a strongly pro-inflammatory, destructive response, the molecular signature of which is associated with inflammatory demyelination during MS. These data indicate that selective inhibition of the local IFN-g response by HspB5-reactive T-cells should inhibit such a destructive response. In a previous Phase I study, intravenous HspB5 was found to be safe and well tolerated in healthy subjects over a wide dose range.

Between EMA approval and fingolimod availability on the Italian market, an open-label single arm study was initiated in Italy, in patients without alternative therapeutic options.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> Evaluating safety and tolerability data in this population.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Main inclusion criteria were: diagnosis of RRMS, Expanded Disability Status Scale score of 0-6.5, no other suitable treatments for MS. Key exclusion criteria were: history of chronic disease of the immune system other than MS, active systemic infections, history or presence of malignancy, uncontrolled diabetes or diabetic retinopathy, macular edema (ME), severe cardiovascular (CV) disease. Safety and tolerability of fingolimod were evaluated by recording adverse events (AEs) and serious AEs (SAEs), vital signs, laboratory (lab) tests and ophthalmology assessments.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Of the 906 enrolled patients, 825 (91%) completed the study. 34/906 (3.7%) prematurely discontinued due to an AE and 3/906 (0.3%) due to pregnancy. Mean duration of treatment was 158.2 days (&#x000b1; 94.2). AEs were recorded in 35.4% of patients, the most frequent being headache (4.1%), influenza (2.1%), lymphopenia (1.8%), asthenia (1.8%) and pyrexia (1.8%). 18/906 (2.0%) patients had a self-limiting CV AE (including 2 cases of atrioventricular block - AVB- second degree Mobitz type I) with onset during the first dose monitoring period (6 hours). Most AEs (94%) were mild or moderate and did not lead to fingolimod discontinuation. SAEs were noted in 2.9% of patients and included 3 cases of ME, 2 cases of troponin increase with normal electrocardiogram, 1 case of AVB second degree Mobitz type I, 1 case of pneumonia, 1 case of acute respiratory failure, 1 case of transaminase increase and 1 case of autoimmune thrombocytopenia. There were no systemic or disseminated opportunistic infections. Lab abnormalities were mainly recorded for transaminases: transaminase increase was reported as SAE in one case and caused study drug discontinuation in 6 cases. Of the 3 pregnancies occurred during the study, there were 2 healthy births and 1 elective abortion.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The results of this study are consistent with the previous clinical trials and confirm that fingolimod is safe and well tolerated in patients with RRMS.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section170-1352458514546077"><title>P084</title><sec id="section171-1352458514546077"><title>Dose-response and safety of high dose vitamin D supplementation: subgroup analysis of an exploratory randomized double blind placebo controlled trial</title><p><underline>K O&#x02019;Connell</underline><sup>1</sup>, K Mulready<sup>2</sup>, J Brady<sup>2</sup>, O Kenny<sup>1</sup>, K Kinsella<sup>1</sup>, S Jordan<sup>1</sup>, C McKenna<sup>3</sup>, C Muldowney<sup>3</sup>, S Basdeo<sup>4</sup>, J Fletcher<sup>4</sup>, D Murphy<sup>5</sup>, E Heffernan<sup>5</sup>, R O&#x02019;Laoide<sup>5</sup>, L Cassidy<sup>6</sup>, K O&#x02019;Rourke<sup>7</sup>, N Tubridy<sup>1</sup>, C McGuigan<sup>1</sup>, M Hutchinson<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>St Vincents University Hospital, Department of Neurology, Dublin, Ireland, <sup>2</sup>Mater University Hospital, Department of Biochemistry, Dublin, Ireland, <sup>3</sup>St Vincent&#x02019;s University Hospital, Pharmacy Department, Dublin, Ireland, <sup>4</sup>Trinity College Dublin, Department of Immunology, Dublin, Ireland, <sup>5</sup>St Vincents University Hospital, Department of Radiology, Dublin, Ireland, <sup>6</sup>Royal Victoria Eye and Ear Hospital, Dublin, Ireland, <sup>7</sup>Mater University Hospital, Department of Neurology, Dublin, Ireland</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Increasing evidence links vitamin D deficiency to both susceptibility to, and severity of, multiple sclerosis. We report the dose- response results in a sub-group analysis of a double blind randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial examining the immunological effects of two doses of vitamin D (5000 IU or 10,000 IU daily) compared to placebo over 24 weeks in both healthy control participants and patients presenting with CIS.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To assess the dose response, safety and tolerability of high dose vitamin D in healthy control participants over 24 weeks.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Healthy control participants, aged 25 -40 years, with a 2:1 female to male ratio and no contraindications to high dose vitamin D supplementation were randomized to receive either, placebo, 5000 IU or 10000 IU of vitamin D for a 24 week period in a 1:1:1 fashion. All participants had renal function and serum calcium measured at 4 weekly intervals and vitamin D and PTH at baseline and weeks 4, 8,16, 24. Adverse events were recorded at each visit.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> 38 healthy control participants {mean age 30 years (SD:4.5), 26 (68%) women} were recruited from November 2012 to June 2013. Mean baseline serum 25(OH)D was 52 (SD: 24.6) nmol/L and PTH 4.7 (1.7) pmol/L. Using a cut-off of serum 25(OH)D &#x0003c; 50 nmol/L as deficient and 50-72.5 nmol/L as insufficient, 22 (58%) participants were classed as deficient, 7 (18%) insufficient and 9 (24%) had an acceptable serum 25(OH)D level of &#x0003e;72.5nmol/L. After seasonal adjustment of vitamin D levels, 76% participants remained deficient or insufficient at baseline. The greatest mean changes in serum 25(OH)D levels were seen between baseline and 16 weeks of dosing: placebo group: -4.2 (SD: 22.5) nmol/L, 5000 IU group: +83.2 (27.2) nmol/L, 10,000 IU group +154.8 (66.2). Serum levels plateaued after 16 weeks. No increases in serum calcium, urea and creatinine levels were observed despite a maximum vitamin D level of 402 nmol/L achieved. No serious adverse events were reported in the course of this study.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> This study adds to the growing evidence that: a) vitamin D deficiency remains highly prevalent in higher latitudes and b) high dose vitamin D supplementation is safe.</p><p>EU Clinical Trials Register: EudraCT: 2012-000635-68.

Patients randomized to PEG-IFN in Year 1 remained on the same dosing regimen in Year 2. Safety data were summarized for all patients who received &#x02265;1 dose of active study treatment over 2 years.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Completion rates at Year 2 were similar across the PEG-IFN groups and across the PBO-to-PEG-IFN groups. Among patients who received PEG-IFN at any time over 2 years (Q2W n=740; Q4W n=728) the incidence of adverse events (AEs) was 94% for each dosing group, and the majority of AEs were mild or moderate in severity. The incidence of severe AEs was 21% and 20% for Q2W and Q4W groups, respectively. The most common AEs across both dosing groups were injection site erythema (Q2W 64%; Q4W 59%), influenza-like illness (Q2W 51%; Q4W 50%), pyrexia (Q2W 43%; Q4W 41%), and headache (Q2W 42%; Q4W 41%). Discontinuations due to AEs were 6% for each PEG-IFN group. Over 2 years, the incidence of serious AEs was higher in the Q4W group (22%) than the Q2W group (16%), with MS relapse the most frequently reported event (Q4W 14%; Q2W 10%). There were a total of nine deaths over the 2-year period, of which four occurred in Year 1 and five occurred in Year 2 (PEG-IFN Q2W n=3; PBO-to-PEG-IFN Q4W n=2 [of which three were considered related to study treatment: PEG-IFN Q2W n=1; PBO-to-PEG-IFN Q4W n=2]). The majority of reductions in hematological parameters and elevations in liver enzymes were not clinically significant and did not result in treatment discontinuation.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The nature, type, and frequency of AEs with PEG-IFN over 2 years are consistent with those observed during Year 1, and are consistent with the known profiles of interferon beta therapies in MS. The safety profile of PEG-IFN was also similar across the Q2W and Q4W dose regimens over 2 years.</p><p><sup>1</sup>Calabresi PA, et al. <italic>Lancet Neurol</italic>, In Press.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section174-1352458514546077"><title>P086</title><sec id="section175-1352458514546077"><title>An interim analysis of the German START-study confirms the good cardiac safety profile of fingolimod</title><p><underline>V Limmroth</underline><sup>1</sup>, S Hoyer<sup>2</sup>, M Lang<sup>3</sup>, S Schmidt<sup>4</sup>, T Ziemssen<sup>5</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Neurologische Klinik, Kliniken der Stadt K&#x000f6;ln, Cologne, Germany, <sup>2</sup>Novartis Pharma GmbH, Nuremberg, Germany, <sup>3</sup>Neurologische Praxis, NTD Study Group, Ulm, Germany, <sup>4</sup>Neurologische Gemeinschaftspraxis, NTD Study Group, Bonn, Germany, <sup>5</sup>Neurologische Klinik, Universit&#x000e4;t Dresden, Dresden, Germany</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Fingolimod, a sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor (S1PR) modulator, was the first oral therapy approved for the treatment of relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS). Following treatment initiation, fingolimod activates S1PR at the surface of cardiac myocytes, resulting in transient pulse rate reduction, and in rare cases in atrioventricular conduction blocks.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> The START-study (cFTY720DDE17) characterizes the cardiac safety profile of fingolimod in RRMS patients after treatment initiation.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> The START study is a prospective, 1-week, multicenter, open-label study enrolling up to 7,000 RRMS patients in more than 250 centers in Germany, according to the EU label criteria of fingolimod. The study consists of a screening period, a baseline visit during which the first fingolimod dose is taken, and a final visit after one week. During screening and at the final visit, a 12-lead ECG is carried out. The procedure at baseline is as follows: prior to the first intake of fingolimod, a 12-lead ECG is recorded. After the first dose, a continuous 6h Holter ECG is recorded, while pulse and blood pressure are measured simultaneously, every hour. A final 12-lead ECG is performed afterwards. In 200 patients, diagnostics include a 24h ECG during screening and at baseline.</p><p>All ECG recordings are centrally evaluated by cardiologists.</p><p>The cardiac safety profile analyzed by the START study focuses in particular on cardiac events requiring extended monitoring according to the label: bradycardia, prolongation of QTcF (Fridericia)-interval as well as second- and third degree AV blocks.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The previous START interim analysis was based on 1230 patients (March 2014). Only 0.7% of the patients developed bradycardia (&#x0003c; 45 bpm) at any time during the 6h observation period, and no patient required medication to treat bradycardia. There was no QTcF-interval prolongation beyond 500msec. Only 43 out of 2702 patients (1.6%) developed a 2<sup>nd</sup> degree AV-block Mobitz type I or higher. All cardiac events were transient. There was no evidence of either bradycardia, QTcF-prolongation or AV block II<sup>0</sup> or III<sup>0</sup> at the end of study, approximately seven days after the first exposure to fingolimod.</p><p>The results of the most recent analysis conducted in August 2014 will be presented.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> This study confirms the good cardiac safety profile of fingolimod, which has already been documented in the previous pivotal multicenter trials.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section176-1352458514546077"><title>P087</title><sec id="section177-1352458514546077"><title>Vitamin D levels in multiple sclerosis in correlation to age, sex, EDSS and dosage of substitution.</title><p><bold>First results of a prospective study</bold></p><p><underline>WL Poellmann</underline><sup>1</sup>, M Starck<sup>1</sup>, J Koehler<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Marianne Strauss Klinik, Berg, Germany</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Vitamin D in multiple sclerosis (MS) is still controversial discussed regarding the impact of serum levels and possible therapeutic options.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> Therefore we initiated a non-interventional study in MS patients in our center to address these questions.

In every group of MS type at least 100 patients will be evaluated and observed over a period of two years. Patients with 25-OH vitamin D3 levels below 45 &#x000b5;g/l are allocated randomly to a substitution with either up to 10.000 IE or 20.000 IE weekly.

In the extension study (NCT00930553), patients received as-needed alemtuzumab re-treatment (12 mg/day IV on 3 consecutive days) &#x02265;1 year apart or permitted use of approved disease-modifying therapy (DMT), on evidence of relapse or magnetic resonance imaging activity. Former SC IFNB-1a patients received 2 alemtuzumab courses in extension.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The extension enrolled 349 (95%) eligible patients from the core study alemtuzumab arm. Through 4 years, 73% of these patients received only 2 annual courses, while 21% and 5% received 1 or 2 additional courses, respectively, and &#x0003c; 5% of patients received another DMT during extension. Nine patients discontinued from the study, none of which resulted from adverse events (AEs). Among patients who received SC IFNB-1a in the core study, 144 (83%) entered the extension and 132 (92%) of these patients received 2 courses of alemtuzumab. There were 8 withdrawals in the crossover group during the 2-year extension period, none due to AEs. Efficacy and safety data will be reported for Year 2 of the extension for the alemtuzumab cohort (Years 3 and 4 of alemtuzumab exposure), and the former SC IFNB-1a crossover cohort (Years 1 and 2 of alemtuzumab exposure).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The majority of treatment-naive patients who received 2 courses of alemtuzumab during the core study did not require further treatment during the 2-year extension period, and few sought alternative therapies or withdrew from the study. Among former SC IFNB-1a patients who received alemtuzumab during the extension, few sought treatment with other therapies or withdrew from alemtuzumab; the majority received both treatment courses and remained in the study.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section184-1352458514546077"><title>P091</title><sec id="section185-1352458514546077"><title>Attitudes of people with multiple sclerosis towards clinical research</title><p><underline>S Jordan</underline><sup>1</sup>, K O&#x02019;Connell<sup>1</sup>, M Duggan<sup>1</sup>, N Tubridy<sup>1</sup>, M Hutchinson<sup>1</sup>, C McGuigan<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>St Vincent&#x02019;s University Hospital, Neurology, Dublin, Ireland</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Clinical research remains invaluable in understanding the natural history of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and the benefits of therapeutic interventions. Treatment options have increased for people with MS. Early access to these potentially effective new therapies is usually through enrolment in clinical trials. In practice many people are reluctant to participate in research. An understanding of patients&#x02019; attitudes towards clinical research is important to identify potential barriers to participation and see if these can be addressed.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To ascertain patients&#x02019; attitudes towards clinical research and identify issues that inhibit recruitment.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> A questionnaire was distributed to patients attending an MS clinic at a tertiary referral centre with an academic/clinical research unit. Demographic and clinical data was collected and analysed using Sphinx software.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Data collection is ongoing but an initial sample of n=33 has been analysed. The population was 23 female/10 male with 30% in the 31-40 year age range. 21/33 of the did not recall being asked to participate in clinical research previously. Of the 12 patients who had been approached to take part in research 9 had participated. 7 had completed a questionnaire-based research, 5 had been in a clinical drug trial. Of those who had previously participated: 5/9 thought it had been beneficial and 11 stated that they would participate again. 20/33 reported they would be interested in participating in clinical trials because of the perceived close clinical monitoring; 18/33 considered that access to a novel therapy would encourage participation. Factors inhibiting recruitment included: safety concerns of a trial medication 18/33 and time constraints 11/33. 23/33 believed that patients should participate in clinical research. 17/33 would participate in a study comparing active treatments, but not a placebo controlled study. 21/33 consider clinical research of benefit to all patients with MS, 20/33 believe it added to medical knowledge, 3/33 thought that it was of benefit to the research team and doctors only.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Initial results, reveals barriers to participating in clinical research in an MS population; include safety concerns and time constraints with regards attending study visits. This allows us to consider these issues when planning further studies to encourage maximum participation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section186-1352458514546077"><title>P092</title><sec id="section187-1352458514546077"><title>GNbAC1, a monoclonal antibody against the MSRV envelope protein, pharmacodynamic responses in patients with multiple sclerosis</title><p><underline>F Curtin</underline><sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>GeNeuro, Plan les Ouates, Switzerland</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Human endogenous retrovirus (HERV) genes represent 8% of the human genome. Among HERV genes, the Multiple Sclerosis associated Retrovirus (MSRV) DNA contains copies expressing a protein called Env, which can activate a pro-inflammatory and autoimmune cascade via Toll-Like receptor 4. MSRV-Env expressed in multiple sclerosis (MS) plaques has an inhibitory effect on oligodendrocyte precursor cell differentiation and affects remyelination. GNbAC1, a humanised monoclonal antibody, binds MSRV-Env. Blocking MSRV-Env by GNbAC1 is expected to have a neuroprotective effect in MS.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To assess the safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics over 1 year of GNbAC1, a monoclonal antibody agonist of the Multiple Sclerosis associated Retrovirus (MSRV) Env protein in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> We report the results of Phase II single ascending dose study followed by a 12-month open-label extension to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of GNbAC1 in 10 MS patients. First, in Cohort 1, 5 patients were randomized to receive a single intravenous infusion of 2 mg/kg of GNbAC1 or placebo; in Cohort 2, 5 patients were randomized to receive an intravenous infusion of 6 mg/kg of GNbAC1 or placebo. Then, all patients of Cohorts 1 and 2 pursued treatment with 11 GNbAC1 infusions at 2 mg/kg and 6 mg/kg dose respectively at 4-week intervals in an open label setting.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> GNbAC1 was well tolerated at both doses. Pharmacokinetic data confirm a dose linear pharmacokinetics with an elimination half-life of 25-36 days compatible with monthly infusions. Pharmacodynamic markers based on brain MRI and cytokines and MSRV biomarkers are presented. MSRV biomarkers decreased during treatment with GNbAC1 and brain MRI showed overall stability; no particular trends could be observed for cytokines over time.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The 12-month results confirm the positive long-term GNbAC1 safety profile in MS patients. The pharmacodynamic data suggest a favourable effect of GNbAC1 on MS. These results pave the way to a large Phase IIb study testing the efficacy and safety of the first monoclonal antibody targeting the MSRV-Env protein.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section188-1352458514546077"><title>P093</title><sec id="section189-1352458514546077"><title>First-in-human phase 1 study of invariant NKT cell ligand OCH</title><p><underline>D Noto</underline><sup>1</sup>, M Araki<sup>2</sup>, W Sato<sup>1</sup>, T Okamoto<sup>3</sup>, M Murata<sup>3</sup>, S Miyake<sup>1,4</sup>, T Yamamura<sup>1,2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>National Institute of Neuroscience, National Center of Neurology and Psychiatry (NCNP), Department of Immunology, Kodaira, Japan, <sup>2</sup>National Center Hospital, NCNP, Multiple Sclerosis Center, Kodaira, Japan, <sup>3</sup>National Center Hospital, NCNP, Department of Neurology, Kodaira, Japan, <sup>4</sup>Juntendo University Graduate School of Medicine, Department of Immunology, Bunkyo-ku, Japan</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> We have previously reported that OCH, a sphingosine-truncated analog of &#x003b1;-galactosylceramide (&#x003b1;GC), that selectively induces IL-4 production from invariant NKT (iNKT) cells, would suppress the development of autoimmune disease models, including experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) (Miyamoto et al.

The aim of the study was to evaluate safety and pharmacokinetics of a single oral administration of OCH, and investigate alterations in immunological parameters and gene expression profiles.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Fifteen healthy subjects were enrolled and allocated to 1 of 5 cohorts and given escalating doses of OCH. We investigated lymphocyte subsets in peripheral blood with flow cytometer, and analyzed gene expressions of whole blood with DNA microarray.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Mild leukopenia occurred in two subjects, but recovered without any treatments. All other adverse events were grade 1. Plasma concentration of OCH was much higher than anticipated based on preclinical study, indicating the bioavailability of OCH may be higher than rodents and primates. Flow cytometer analysis of lymphocyte subsets revealed that GM-CSF producing fractions in CD4+ memory T cells and CD8+ T cells were reduced after administration of OCH in all cohorts. IFN-&#x003b3; producing fraction in CD4+ memory and CD8+ T cells were also reduced in lower dose cohorts. DNA microarray analysis revealed that expressions of some genes associated with autoimmune responses were decreased, and some immunoregulatory genes were increased.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The results were potentially interesting and allowed us to start an early phase 2 study for patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). At April 2012, we have finished administration of OCH to two MS patients and analysis of immunological parameters.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section190-1352458514546077"><title>P094</title><sec id="section191-1352458514546077"><title>Safety and tolerability of daclizumab HYP treatment in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis: results of the DECIDE study</title><p><underline>K Selmaj</underline><sup>1</sup>, L Kappos<sup>2</sup>, DL Arnold<sup>3,4</sup>, E Havrdova<sup>5</sup>, A Boyko<sup>6</sup>, M Kaufman<sup>7</sup>, H Wiendl<sup>8</sup>, J Rose<sup>9</sup>, S Greenberg<sup>10</sup>, E Demirhan<sup>11</sup>, K Riester<sup>11</sup>, M Sweetser<sup>11</sup>, J Elkins<sup>11</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Medical University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland, <sup>2</sup>University Hospital, Basel, Switzerland, <sup>3</sup>NeuroRx Research, Montreal, QC, Canada, <sup>4</sup>McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada, <sup>5</sup>First School of Medicine, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic, <sup>6</sup>Moscow Multiple Sclerosis Center, Moscow, Russian Federation, <sup>7</sup>Carolinas Medical Center, Charlotte, NC, United States, <sup>8</sup>University of M&#x000fc;nster, M&#x000fc;nster, Germany, <sup>9</sup>University of Utah Medical School, Salt Lake City, UT, United States, <sup>10</sup>Abbvie Biotherapeutics Inc, Redwood City, CA, United States, <sup>11</sup>Biogen Idec, Cambridge, MA, United States</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Daclizumab high-yield process (DAC HYP), a humanized monoclonal IgG1 antibody against CD25 subunit of interleukin-2 receptor.

Teriflunomide 14 mg reduced the risk of relapse determining conversion to clinically definite MS (primary endpoint) by 42.6% vs placebo (<italic>P</italic>=0.0087), and of a new relapse or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) lesion (key secondary endpoint) by 34.9% (<italic>P</italic>=0.0003). The 7-mg dose was also superior to placebo, with a smaller effect. The approach to diagnosis of MS changed during TOPIC (first patient randomized, February 2008; last patient, last visit, December 2012). The McDonald criteria were revised in 2010, potentially allowing earlier diagnosis of MS and at the first clinical episode in some patients.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To apply 2010 McDonald diagnostic criteria to re-analyze TOPIC study outcomes.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> A total of 614 patients with CIS received once-daily treatment with teriflunomide 14 mg, 7 mg, or placebo for up to 108 weeks. Key inclusion criteria were first clinical episode suggestive of MS within 90 days and an MRI scan showing &#x02265;2 T2 lesions &#x02265;3 mm in diameter. The 2010 McDonald criteria were applied retrospectively; patients were grouped according to their baseline disease characteristics as meeting new criteria, not meeting new criteria, or unclassifiable (insufficient information). Time to MS diagnosis based on 2010 McDonald criteria was analyzed for the group of patients not meeting these criteria at baseline. Using the three groups described above, subgroup analyses were performed for primary and key secondary endpoints.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> At entry, 245 patients did not meet 2010 McDonald criteria. Of the remaining patients, 78 met the criteria for MS, and 291 were unclassifiable. For patients not meeting 2010 McDonald criteria, the probability of conversion to MS based on 2010 McDonald criteria by 108 weeks was 54.1% (teriflunomide 14 mg), 63.0% (teriflunomide 7 mg), and 74.4% (placebo).

In phase 2 and 3 studies, teriflunomide has shown beneficial effects on clinical and magnetic resonance imaging parameters vs placebo, with the 14-mg dose consistently demonstrating greater efficacy than the 7-mg dose. In individual studies, teriflunomide was well tolerated, with a well-characterized safety profile.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To report safety outcomes using pooled data from four, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of teriflunomide.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Data were pooled from the phase 2 (NCT01487096) and phase 3 TEMSO (NCT00134563), TOWER (NCT00751881), and TOPIC (NCT00622700) studies. Patients were randomized to receive teriflunomide 14 mg, 7 mg, or placebo. Safety assessments included treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), laboratory parameters, and physical examinations. Per protocol, confirmed alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &#x0003e;3&#x000d7; upper limit of normal (ULN) or neutrophil count &#x0003c; 1000 cells/&#x000b5;L, regardless of presence/absence of symptoms, mandated study discontinuation.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 3044 patients were included in analyses, representing &#x0003e;1500 patient-years of cumulative treatment exposure per group. Common TEAEs reported more frequently with teriflunomide were hair thinning, diarrhea, ALT elevation, headache, and nausea. Most TEAEs were transient and mild to moderate in intensity. Discontinuations due to TEAEs were more frequent in patients receiving teriflunomide (14 mg, 12.5%; 7 mg, 11.2%; placebo, 7.5%). ALT increases were the most common reason for treatment discontinuation in all groups (due to protocol requirements). ALT elevations &#x02264;3&#x000d7; ULN occurred more frequently with teriflunomide; however, the incidence of ALT &#x0003e;3&#x000d7; ULN and serious hepatic TEAEs was similar across groups. Decreases in neutrophil or lymphocyte counts were not associated with an increased risk of infection. Serious infections occurred with similar frequency (&#x02264;2.7% of patients) in all groups. Malignancies occurred in &#x02264;0.5% of patients in any group (14 mg, n=3; 7 mg, n=2; placebo, n=5). No hematological or lymphoproliferative malignancies were reported.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Pooled safety data from &#x0003e;3070 patient-years of teriflunomide exposure were consistent with those of individual studies and did not identify any unexpected safety signals with either dose. As teriflunomide 14 mg is more efficacious, with a similar safety profile to the 7-mg dose, it has a better benefit-to-risk profile.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section198-1352458514546077"><title>P098</title><sec id="section199-1352458514546077"><title>TRUST study design-a study to evaluate an integrated approach for optimized patient management in multiple sclerosis patients treated with natalizumab</title><p>H-P Hartung<sup>1</sup>, T Ziemssen<sup>2</sup>, A Bayas<sup>3</sup>, B Tackenberg<sup>4</sup>, J W&#x000fc;rfel<sup>5,6</sup>, V Limmroth<sup>7</sup>, R Linker<sup>8</sup>, M M&#x000e4;urer<sup>9</sup>, J Haas<sup>10</sup>, M Stangel<sup>11</sup>, <underline>O Harlin</underline><sup>12</sup>, C Winterstein<sup>12</sup>, M Meergans<sup>12</sup>, C Wernsd&#x000f6;rfer<sup>12</sup>, A Gass<sup>13</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>University of D&#x000fc;sseldorf, Dept. of Neurology, D&#x000fc;sseldorf, Germany, <sup>2</sup>University of Dresden, Center of Clinical Neuroscience, Dresden, Germany, <sup>3</sup>Hospital of Augsburg, Dept. of Neurology, Augsburg, Germany, <sup>4</sup>Philipps University, Dept. of Neurology, Marburg, Germany, <sup>5</sup>University of G&#x000f6;ttingen, G&#x000f6;ttingen, Germany, <sup>6</sup>Charite, Berlin, Germany, <sup>7</sup>Cologne City Hospitals, University of Cologne, Dept. of Neurology, Cologne, Germany, <sup>8</sup>Friedrich-Alexander-Universit&#x000e4;t, Dept. of Neurology, Erlangen, Germany, <sup>9</sup>Caritas Hospital, Dept. of Neurology, Bad Mergentheim, Germany, <sup>10</sup>Jewish Hospital Berlin, Centre for Multiple Sclerosis, Berlin, Germany, <sup>11</sup>Hannover Medical School, Dept. of Neurology, Hannover, Germany, <sup>12</sup>Biogen Idec, Ismaning, Germany, <sup>13</sup>Universit&#x000e4;tsmedizin Mannheim, University of Heidelberg, Dept. of Neurology, Mannheim, Germany</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Natalizumab is an intravenously applied humanized monoclonal antibody, indicated as escalation treatment for RRMS patients.

Long-term data on patient-reported outcomes, decisions to continue/discontinue therapy, practicability of patient monitoring, pharmaco-economic aspects and the overall safety profile of natalizumab will be collected from RRMS Patients in approx. 200 neurological clinics and practices all over Germany. The non-interventional prospective design allows the role of biomarkers in treatment decisions- and frequent MRI- for early detection of PML in a real-world setting.

The lack of GA 20mg once-daily (QD) dosing in GALA precludes direct comparison with 40mg TIW. Daily GA 20mg and 40mg dosing was assessed in the FORTE study.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To perform indirect comparisons of GA 20mg QD and GA 40mg TIW effects on ARR using statistical regression models to predict 1) ARR of typical patients (pts) who received GA 20mg QD in clinical trials if they had received 40mg TIW; and 2) ARR of typical GALA 40mg TIW pts if they had received GA 20mg QD.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> The ARR of GA 40mg TIW in GALA was estimated using negative binomial regression as a function of pt baseline (BL) characteristics. Initially 8 BL covariates were used in the model as main effects; the final model included only 4 that were predictive (<italic>p</italic>&#x02264;.05) of ARR: age, BL EDSS, presence of GdE lesions at BL (0/&#x02265;1) and number of relapses in the year before screening (1/2); and country/geographical region was forced into the model. Predicted ARR for GA 40mg TIW with GALA averaged BL covariates was compared with observed ARR to validate the tool. The model was then used to predict ARR for pts in studies of 20mg QD (REGARD, BEYOND, CONFIRM) had they instead received 40mg TIW, given their BL characteristics. The predictive model built from FORTE GA 20mg QD data used the same 4 covariates to predict ARR for GALA pts had they instead received GA 20mg QD, which was indirectly compared with the reported ARR in GALA.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Supporting final model validity, predicted ARR for GALA pts receiving GA 40mg TIW (0.32, 95%CI 0.27-0.38) was similar to the actual ARR (0.33, 0.28-0.39). Predicted ARRs for typical REGARD (0.31, 0.26-0.36) and BEYOND (0.32, 0.27-0.38) pts, had they received GA 40mg TIW, were similar to reported ARRs for GA 20mg QD in REGARD (0.29, 0.25-0.34) and BEYOND (0.34, 0.28-0.42). Predicted ARR for a typical CONFIRM pt (0.32, 0.27-0.38) had he/she received GA 40mg TIW was slightly higher than observed ARR (0.29, 0.23-0.35). In the predictive model built from FORTE data, predicted ARR for a typical GALA pt had she/he received GA 20mg QD (0.29, 0.24-0.35) was similar to the reported ARR (0.33, 0.28-0.39).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Indirect comparison of the effects on ARR of GA 40mg TIW in GALA with effects of GA 20mg QD from large, prospective, well-controlled trials using predictive models demonstrates the similar efficacy of the two GA dosing regimens.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section204-1352458514546077"><title>P101</title><sec id="section205-1352458514546077"><title>Effect of fingolimod on evolution of baseline enhancing MRI lesions into persistent T1 hypointense lesions: post hoc analysis of the FREEDOMS study</title><p><underline>EW Radue</underline><sup>1</sup>, T Sprenger<sup>1,2</sup>, A de Vera<sup>3</sup>, G Francis<sup>4</sup>, E Rochotte<sup>3</sup>, D Tomic<sup>3</sup>, L Kappos<sup>2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Medical Image Analysis Center (MIAC), University Hospital, Basel, Switzerland, <sup>2</sup>University Hospital, Department of Neurology, Basel, Switzerland, <sup>3</sup>Novartis Pharma AG, Basel, Switzerland, <sup>4</sup>Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, East Hanover, NJ, United States</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> In relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS), the presence of gadolinium-enhancing (Gd+) T1 lesions on brain MRI reflects active focal inflammation. Fingolimod significantly reduced the formation of Gd+ lesions in the 2-year, phase 3, double-blind, randomized, placebo (Pbo)-controlled, FREEDOMS study in RRMS. Some Gd+ lesions evolve into persistent T1 hypointense lesions, considered as indicators of severe tissue damage.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To evaluate the effect of fingolimod therapy on the evolution of pre-existing Gd+ lesions to persistent T1 hypointense lesions in RRMS patients in the FREEDOMS study.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Gd+ lesions detected in baseline MRI scan (acquired during screening period) were followed at each post baseline scan to report persistent T1 hypointense lesions. Summary statistics were generated at both the patient and lesion level by treatment group (fingolimod 0.5mg, 1.25mg and Pbo). The percentage (%) of Gd+ lesions that evolved into T1 hypointense lesions and % of patients in whom this was observed was estimated at Months (M) 6, 12 and 24 by a logistic Generalized Estimating Equation (GEE) method and a logistic regression model adjusted for treatment and number of Gd+ lesions at screening.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Of the 1270 patients with available scans at screening, 38% of the fingolimod 0.5 mg group and 36.8% of the Pbo group had &#x02265;1 Gd+ lesion. Groups were balanced except for lower mean number (SD) of Gd+ lesions/patient at screening in the Pbo (3.4[4]) vs. the fingolimod groups (0.5 mg: 4.3[8.4]; 1.25 mg: 4.6[6.5]). The mean % Gd+ lesions at screening that evolved into T1 hypointense lesions was lower in the fingolimod 0.5 mg group vs. Pbo, at all-time points (M6, 39% vs 53% [odds ratio, OR] 0.61,p=0.006, M12: 30% vs. 43% [OR 0.62,p=0.012] and M 24, 29% vs. 38% [OR:0.63,p=0.018]). The % patients who had any Gd+ lesion at screening that evolved to a T1 hypointense lesion was lower at M 6, 12 and 24 for fingolimod 0.5 mg vs. Pbo (M0-6: 63% vs 75%, p=0.014; M0-12: 65% vs. 76%,p=0.031; M0-24: 66% vs. 76%,p=0.042). Data for fingolimod 1.25 mg/day were comparable after correction for imbalances at screening.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Fingolimod 0.5 mg significantly reduced the proportion of Gd+ lesions, at screening, that evolved into persistent T1 hypointense lesions at M6, M12 and M24, versus placebo. These findings indicate that fingolimod reduces the permanent damage caused by acute inflammatory lesions already present before starting treatment.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section206-1352458514546077"><title>P102</title><sec id="section207-1352458514546077"><title>No evident disease activity at 24 weeks in patients with relapsing MS treated with interferon &#x003b2;-1a SC vs. interferon &#x003b2;-1a IM in the EVIDENCE study</title><p><underline>PK Coyle</underline><sup>1</sup>, J Fang<sup>2</sup>, A Hassan<sup>2</sup>, C Cha<sup>2</sup>, F Dangond<sup>2</sup>, AT Reder<sup>3</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Stony Brook University, Department of Neurology, Stony Brook, NY, United States, <sup>2</sup>EMD Serono, Inc., Rockland, MA, United States, <sup>3</sup>University of Chicago, Chicago, MA, United States</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> EVIDENCE (EVidence of Interferon Dose-response: European North American Comparative Efficacy) was an assessor-blinded, randomized, parallel-group study conducted over an average of 64 weeks.

In the CARE-MS II trial in active RRMS patients who relapsed on prior therapy, alemtuzumab had superior efficacy vs subcutaneous interferon beta-1a, including reduction in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) activity and brain volume loss over 2 years. Durable effects on clinical efficacy were still observed at Year 3 in an extension study.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To examine MRI outcomes over 3 years in alemtuzumab-treated patients who relapsed on prior therapy.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Patients who received alemtuzumab (12 mg/day intravenously on 5 consecutive days and on 3 consecutive days 12 months later) in CARE-MS II (NCT00548405) continued uninterrupted follow-up in the extension study (NCT00930553), during which they were eligible for alemtuzumab re-treatment on evidence of disease activity. MRI scans were acquired at baseline, and at 1, 2, and 3 years. MRI measurements included proportions of patients with gadolinium (Gd)-enhancing, new or enlarging T<sub>2</sub>-hyperintense, and new T<sub>1</sub>-hypointense lesions; proportion of patients MRI activity-free (absence of both Gd-enhancing and T<sub>2</sub> lesions); T<sub>2</sub> and T<sub>1</sub> lesion volumes; and brain volume loss (brain parenchymal fraction change).</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Of 435 alemtuzumab-treated patients in the core study, 393 entered the extension and 80 (20%) received alemtuzumab re-treatment in Year 3. The proportions of patients with new or active lesions were low and did not differ significantly between Years 2 and 3 for Gd-enhancing lesions (8.7% [95% CI: 6.0, 11.5] vs 13.5% [10.0, 17.0]), T<sub>2</sub> lesions (23.7% [19.6, 27.8] vs 31.0% [26.3, 35.8]), or T<sub>1</sub> lesions (7.2% [4.6, 9.7] vs 12.5% [9.1, 15.9]). A majority of patients were free of MRI activity at Year 3 (68%). At Year 3, there were no significant changes from baseline in either median T<sub>2</sub> lesion volume (-1.6% [IQR: -13.8, 9.5]) or T<sub>1</sub> lesion volume (1.9% [IQR: -33.7, 42.3]). The median rate of brain volume loss decreased over time (Year 0&#x02013;1: -0.48% [95% CI: -0.57, -0.38], Years 1-2: -0.22% [-0.29, -0.16], Years 2&#x02013;3, -0.10% [-0.22, -0.03]).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Most patients who relapsed on prior therapy were free of new lesions and MRI activity in the third year after initiating treatment with alemtuzumab. A continued slowing of brain volume loss was observed in Year 3. Given that most patients did not receive additional alemtuzumab or other disease-modifying therapy in their third year, the results support the durable efficacy of alemtuzumab in RRMS.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section210-1352458514546077"><title>P104</title><sec id="section211-1352458514546077"><title>No evident disease activity in relapsing MS patients treated with interferon &#x003b2;-1a SC vs. interferon &#x003b2;-1a IM: subgroup analyses of the EVIDENCE study</title><p><underline>PK Coyle</underline><sup>1</sup>, J Fang<sup>2</sup>, A Hassan<sup>2</sup>, C Cha<sup>2</sup>, F Dangond<sup>2</sup>, AT Reder<sup>3</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Stony Brook University, Department of Neurology, Stony Brook, NY, United States, <sup>2</sup>EMD Serono, Inc., Rockland, MA, United States, <sup>3</sup>University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, United States</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Previously, the EVIDENCE (EVidence of Interferon Dose-response: European North American Comparative Efficacy) study showed that more patients with relapsing MS (RMS) remained relapse-free at 24 weeks with interferon beta-1a (IFN &#x003b2;-1a) subcutaneously (SC) than with IFN &#x003b2;-1a intramuscularly (IM) (75% vs. 63%, p&#x0003c; 0.001).</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold>

Many preclinical and clinical studies have shown that the exogenously administration of PEA exerts antiinflammatory, pain-relieving and neuroprotective effects.

A PK/PD sequential modeling approach was used to evaluate the number of lesions at a population level, including the inter-patient variability. Negative binomial regression, with an Emax function characterizing drug effect, was used to characterize the lesion count dynamics. Individual number of CUALs at every month up to month six was related to time, individual predicted steady-state concentrations and off-set placebo effect. Inter-patient variability was accounted via placebo random effect. Covariate analysis investigated the effect of disease severity (baseline Gd-T1 lesion load), demographic covariates (sex, age and weight) and individual post hoc estimates of the lymphocyte count reduction on the underlying placebo and the drug effect on lesion count.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Covariate analysis revealed effects of age and baseline Gd-T1 lesion load on the placebo MRI effect. Sex had an effect on Emax, the maximal effect of lesion count reduction. Weight had no effects on any of the parameters. Individual lymphocyte reduction effect showed a possible positive correlation with the drug effect on MRI reduction, but statistically sound assessment of this effect would require more data on lymphocyte counts to be analyzed.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The full PK/PD modeling approach allowed for a robust assessment of the parameters of interest.

MIS416 is a microparticulate formulation of bacterial ligands for NOD-2 and TLR9 cytosolic receptors. Following systemic administration, MIS416 targets liver associated phagocytic cells and initiates complex innate immune signalling pathways that have the potential to counter-regulate inflammatory pathways associated with SPMS based on studies in mouse EAE [1] and human compassionate use experience.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> Analysis of phase 2a clinical trial plasma samples for MIS416 pharmacodynamic activity and anti-inflammatory mediators.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Patients (n-15) with SPMS were treated weekly with 0.5 mg MIS416 intravenously for 12 weeks (trial ref. no. NCT01191996). Peripheral blood serum was collected at baseline, pre and 24 hour post administration of MIS416 at weeks 1, 2, 3 and 4 and pre dose at weeks 7 and 10. Flow cytometry bead arrays were used to quantify multiple immune related proteins.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Longitudinal analysis of serum demonstrated that in accordance with the composition of MIS416 and targeted proximal signalling pathways, innate IFN&#x003b3; and interferon-inducible chemokines such as MIG and IP-10 were transiently elevated following each dose. Importantly, pro-inflammatory mediators such as IL-12p70, TNF&#x003b1; and IL-1&#x003b2; remained undetectable and magnetic resonance imaging confirmed MIS416 treatment did not activate existing or new lesions. Of particular clinical significance was the induction of negative regulators of inflammation such as IL-10 and IL-12p40, which also both showed transient elevation associated with each weekly dose of MIS416. Furthermore, the magnitude of the IL-10 and IL-12p40 response showed a positive correlation with the magnitude of the IFN&#x003b3; response.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> These data support the hypothesis that innate IFN&#x003b3; induced <italic>de novo</italic>, can negatively regulate inflammation by induction of anti-inflammatory feedback pathways.

All subjects underwent multimodal MR imaging, including fMRI at rest; they were also scored with PASAT. Data were analysed with tools from FMRIB Software Library; the seed-based method was used to identify the thalamic RS network (RSN) (cluster level, P &#x0003c; .05, corrected for family wise error [FWE]).</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Thalamic RSN was altered in both SP and RR with respect to HS; greatest FC abnormalities were observed in SP. In particular, thalamo-cortical FC was lower in RR than in HS in left temporo-occipital, frontal and parietal cortices, bilaterally and in the cerebellum; SP showed decreased FC in the same brain areas, which were even more extensively affected, and, in addition, in the medial thalami.</p><p>Thalamo-cortical FC was higher in RR than in HS in the right frontal and in the mesial occipital and cingulate cortices, bilaterally; SP showed increased FC also in the right temporo-occipital cortex, hippocampi and posterior thalami, in addition to the aforementioned brain areas. PASAT scores were significantly lower in patients than HS and in SP than in RR. In RR, PASAT scores significantly correlated with thalamo-cortical FC in the frontal cortex bilaterally, thalami and left anterior insula, indicating that worse the performance greater the FC. In SP widespread hyperconnectivity, including the cerebellum, thalami, posterior cingulate, anterior insula and multiple foci in the whole cerebral cortex, inversely correlated with PASAT scores.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our data indicate that thalamic RSN is progressively altered in the two MS subtypes: SP showed more extensive patterns of both significantly decreased and increased FC than RR.

In addition to neurologic examination and the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT), patients completed the CogState brief battery which includes tasks measuring information processing (Detection and Identification), working memory (One-Back), and visual memory (One-Card Learning).</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Diagnoses were MS (n=32) or clinically-isolated (n=1) or radiologically-isolated (n=2) syndromes. Ages ranged from 10 to 24 years (mean 18.27&#x000b1;3.12) with EDSS scores from 0.0 to 4.0 with a median of 1.0 and average disease duration was 3.63 &#x000b1; 3.23 years. Mean SDMT z score was -0.44 &#x000b1;1.18 (range of -1.76 to 3.39), with thirty-one percent (31%) scoring in the impaired range (one standard deviation or more below the mean). All participants&#x02019; CogState data met criteria demonstrating acceptable completion and integrity.

Decreased IPS is often the first sign of neurocognitive impairment in children and teens with multiple sclerosis (MS). Prompt identification of pediatric MS patients with impaired IPS requires a sensitive testing metric that can be administered in a clinical setting. The computerized version of the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (c-SDMT) measures IPS over 8 consecutive trials/session. Faster performance (=increase in IPS) across successive trials is expected.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> 1) To establish normative c-SDMT data in healthy children (HC); 2) To examine test-retest reliability of the c-SDMT in HC; 3) To compare the overall c-SDMT-performance and increase in IPS over 8 consecutive trials between HC and MS patients.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Cross-sectional study including 478 HC (237 female, 49.5%) and 27 MS patients (22 female, 81.5%), divided into five age-epochs (of 2 years each, range from 8-18 years). IPS was assessed using the mean time on 8 consecutive trials on the c-SDMT. Test-retest reliability was evaluated using an intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Multiple linear regression models on rank transformed data were used for predictive analyses in HC. The performance of each MS patient was compared to 4 sex and age matched HC.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Across all ages, HC showed a median (IQR) c-SDMT score of 14.2 seconds (12.5-17.4). In the linear regression analysis, age and academic giftedness were significantly associated with faster IPS in HC (p&#x0003c; 0.001). Furthermore, older HC between 12-18 years were also able to show a faster performance (=increase in IPS) across 8 consecutive trials (12-13 years: p=0.004; 14-18 years: p &#x0003c; 0.001), whereas the IPS in HC below 12 years of age did not increase over 8 consecutive trials. Test-retest reliability was high (ICC= 0.91) in HC across all age groups. In the sex and age matched comparison between HC and MS patients, the median (IQR) c-SDMT score was 12.8 seconds (11.7-15.9) in MS patients and 12.1 seconds (11.8-12.8) in HC (p=0.23). However, MS patients were significantly less likely to show a faster performance across successive trials compared to matched HC (p&#x0003c; 0.001).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The c-SDMT reliably measures IPS in healthy children and adolescents. Although the median c-SDMT score did not differ between MS patients and healthy controls, the failure to perform the test more quickly over the trials suggests that MS patients may be less able to access neural networks sub serving practice efficiency.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section243-1352458514546077"><title>P120</title><sec id="section244-1352458514546077"><title>How does neurological reserve compare between MS patients and healthy controls?</title><p><underline>CE Schwartz</underline><sup>1,2,3</sup>, A Ayandeh<sup>1</sup>, B Weinstock-Guttman<sup>4</sup>, RH Benedict<sup>4</sup>, R Zivadinov<sup>4</sup>, M Ramanthan<sup>5</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>DeltaQuest Foundation, Concord, MA, United States, <sup>2</sup>Tufts University Medical School, Medicine and Orthopaedic Surgery, Boston, MA, United States, <sup>3</sup>Oslo and Akershus University College of Applied Sciences, Nursing, Oslo, Norway, <sup>4</sup>University of Buffalo, Department of Neurology, Buffalo, MA, United States, <sup>5</sup>University of Buffalo, Pharmaceutical Sciences, Buffalo, NY, United States</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Neurological reserve has been implicated as a possible protective factor in MS, perhaps buffering the individual from disease progression.

T2* maps were registered to cortical surfaces, and sampled along the cortex at 25%, 50%, and 75% depth from the pial surface, and at 1 mm below the cortex.

The total surface area of significant correlation between CI and T2* was greater at 75% (167 cm<sup>2</sup>) than at 50% (138 cm<sup>2</sup>) and 25% (78 cm<sup>2</sup>) depth, and at 1 mm below the cortex (24 cm<sup>2</sup>). The total area of significant negative correlation between T2* and individual attention, visuo-spatial, and processing speed tests scores was also maximal at 75% depth. On the contrary, for the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, the total error and perseveration scores correlated mainly with intracortical T2* at 25% and 50% respectively.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> In MS, impairment of cognitive domains assessing cortical-subcortical functions is associated with pathology in deepest cortical layers, next to WM, and in juxta-cortex.

Past research by our team has shown that individuals with MS are more susceptible to CF when compared to healthy controls (HCs); however, this has not yet been examined longitudinally.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> The primary goal was to evaluate CF in a sample of early-phase relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) and to examine how an individual&#x02019;s susceptibility to CF changes over a 3-year period.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Twenty-five individuals with a confirmed diagnosis of RRMS were compared to 20 HCs. Individuals completed the 3&#x0201d; Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT) at baseline and 3-year follow-up as part of a larger neuropsychological battery. The PASAT was scored using three different methods: total correct, total correct dyads, and percent dyad scores. CF was analyzed by comparing performance on the 1<sup>st</sup> of the task vs. the 2<sup>nd</sup> half of the task across the three scoring methods. Results are preliminary given that some follow-up assessments are pending.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Performance on the PASAT improved over time in both groups regardless of scoring method utilized; however, healthy controls consistently performed better than the MS group at both times. CF was evident in both groups at baseline across the three scoring methods; however, neither group appeared more susceptible to CF than the other. At follow-up, CF was noted for both groups (using total correct and total dyad scores); with the MS group showing more cognitive fatigue than HCs when using the total correct score. While CF was still evident at follow-up, neither group showed a greater <italic>vulnerability</italic> to CF at follow-up when compared to their vulnerability at baseline. In fact, the degree of CF was less striking at follow-up.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The ability of the PASAT to differentiate between groups remains stable over time, with the MS group consistently performing worse than HCs. However, performance in both groups improved over time (i.e. benefited from practice). As previously reported by our team, the MS group showed greater vulnerability to CF, but only at follow-up, and only with traditional scoring methods. Although CF was present at both time points for both groups, all were less severely cognitively fatigued at follow-up. Contrary to expectations, in this group of individuals with early-phase RRMS, there was no evidence of cognitive worsening over time. Neither performance, nor CF, was worse at the three-year follow-up.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section249-1352458514546077"><title>P123</title><sec id="section250-1352458514546077"><title>Application of the Brief International Cognitive Assessment for Multiple Sclerosis (BICAMS) to pediatric-onset MS</title><p><underline>LB Krupp</underline><sup>1,2</sup>, LE Charvet<sup>1,2</sup>, MW Porter<sup>1,2</sup>, N Amadiume<sup>1,2</sup>, AL Belman<sup>1,2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Stony Brook University, Department of Neurology, Stony Brook, NY, United States, <sup>2</sup>Lourie Center for Pediatric MS, Stony Brook, NY, United States</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> The possibility of cognitive impairment is a major concern in MS, including the youngest affected with pediatric-onset. There is a need for brief, practical and universal assessment approaches. The BICAMS battery was developed by an international committee and validated for use in adults. It includes the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) supplemented with the learning trials from the California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT) and Brief Visuomotor Retention Test-Revised (BVMT-R).</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To extend the application of the BICAMS approach to all MS subgroups we evaluated its utility in patients with pediatric onset.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Thirty-nine consecutively-recruited outpatients diagnosed with pediatric-onset MS (n=35), CIS (n=1) or RIS (n=3) completed a modified version of the BICAMS assessment during routine clinic visits. The adult BICAMS battery was modified by replacing the CVLT-II with the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT). While both are verbal list learning tasks, the same RAVLT form can be used in patients as young as 8 years and through adult and also has more available alternate forms. Performances were compared to published norms.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Participants ages ranged from 10 to 24 years (mean 18.4&#x000b1;3.2) with EDSS scores from 0.0 to 4.0 with a median of 1.0. Mean SDMT z score was -0.55 &#x000b1;1.20, with a range of -2.76 to 1.20. Mean RAVLT learning z-score was -0.44 &#x000b1; 1.39, with a range of -3.71 to 2.19. Mean BVMT-R learning z score was -0.17 &#x000b1; 1.42 with a range of -3.99 to 2.24. Percent of sample impaired (falling one standard deviation or more below normative mean) was 31% for the SDMT, 28% for the RAVLT, and 27% for the BVMT-R. These rates of impairment are consistent with what has been reported in larger pediatric MS samples with more extensive batteries.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The BICAMS battery is suitable for a pediatric-onset sample. A verbal learning task able to be uniformly administered across the full age span may have advantages.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section251-1352458514546077"><title>P124</title><sec id="section252-1352458514546077"><title>Rasch analysis of performance based cognitive measures in two distinct medical diseases, MS and HIV</title><p><underline>S Hum</underline><sup>1</sup>, Y Lapierre<sup>2</sup>, NE Mayo<sup>3</sup>, LE Finch<sup>3</sup>, A Tsuchida<sup>4</sup>, LK Fellows<sup>5</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>McGill University, MS Clinic, Montreal, QC, Canada, <sup>2</sup>Montreal Neurological Institute, MS Clinic, Montreal, QC, Canada, <sup>3</sup>McGill University Health Centre Research Institute, Montreal, QC, Canada, <sup>4</sup>McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada, <sup>5</sup>McGill University, Neurology and Neurosurgery, Montreal, QC, Canada</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Recent findings from modeling cognitive impairment in people who are HIV+ showed it to be compatible with diffuse dysfunction rather than focal damage: Domain-specific neurocognitive tests fit a unidimensional construct and could be aligned hierarchically to produce a measure with valid units. We tested whether cognitive impairment in MS would have similar characteristics.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> The objective was to estimate the extent to which the tests of cognitive ability behave in the same manner in MS and HIV.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> A sample of 75 HIV+ people and 79 people with relapsing-remitting MS who tested in the none or mild cognitive impairment range on screening were recruited from MUHC sites and completed a battery of computerized and bedside cognitive tests. Rasch analysis was used to test fit of the items to the underlying hierarchy and identify items that were redundant. First the items were fit on the HIV+ sample, then on the MS sample, and then on the combined sample.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The HIV+ group, 93% men, was 47 years old (SD 8.5) and diagnosed with HIV for 14 years (SD 6.6). The MS group, 77% women, was 38.5 years old (SD 8.2) and had disease onset 6.4 years (SD 2.8) prior. In all samples, all items fit a unidimensional hierarchy, with the exception of items from the MMSE, which were all passed. Out of the remaining 57 items, 28 uniquely fit the HIV+ sample, 23 uniquely fit the MS sample, and 32 fit for both combined. For the final model, all 32 items were calibrated in the combined HIV+/MS groups. The items that fit the Rasch model were well distributed along a standardized continuum (mean 0; SD 1) with a location of 0 (logits) and an SD of 1.7. The mean location of people, however, was higher than expected with a mean location of 1.79 logits and SD, 0.9. Reliability of the person estimates of cognitive ability was 0.64 which is low owing to the mistargeting of the items to the ability of the persons tested. There was no differential item functioning across conditions.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The tests fit with a model for a unidimensional cognitive ability construct in both HIV+ and MS, suggesting that cognitive impairment can be understood in terms of diffuse dysfunction in both conditions. The findings provide a path to accurately measure this construct, important for testing interventions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section253-1352458514546077"><title>P125</title><sec id="section254-1352458514546077"><title>The Brief International Cognitive Assessment for Multiple Sclerosis (BICAMS): an Irish validation study</title><p><underline>K O&#x02019;Connell</underline><sup>1</sup>, DW Langdon<sup>2</sup>, M Hutchinson<sup>1</sup>, N Tubridy<sup>1</sup>, C McGuigan<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>St Vincents University Hospital, Dublin, Ireland, <sup>2</sup>Royal Holloway, University of London, Department of Clinical Psychology, Surrey, United Kingdom</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Cognitive impairment is common in MS irrespective of disease stage or subtype.

Participants with a history of major medical, neurologic or psychiatric illnesses, active substance abuse, current psychoactive medication usage (chronic sedatives/hypnotics and narcotic analgesics), MMSE &#x0003c; 28, and Beck Depression Inventory &#x0003e; 9 were excluded. Effects of age and education were correlated with SMT performance. A subset of participants (N=33) were administered the SMT twice to examine test-retest reliability (concordance correlation coefficient). Another subset (N=25) were administered both the SMT and 10/36 to examine convergent validity (Pearson correlation). For both SMT and 10/36, learning effects were examined by presenting the same design (10 interspersed filled circles) for 5 trials (SMT and 10/36 used different designs; maximum number of correctly recalled items=50).</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> As expected for an episodic memory test, SMT performance correlated negatively with age (r=&#x02212;.49, p&#x0003c; 0.001), but did not correlate with education (r=&#x02212;.02, p=0.83). Females performed slightly better (3.0 items) better than males (p=0.08). SMT test-retest reliability (CCC)=0.53. A non-significant (p=0.34) increase in total recalled items (mean=1.2) was observed from the 1<sup>st</sup> to 2<sup>nd</sup> administration.

The functional MRI (fMRI) version of the SDMT (fMRI-SDMT) can be used to understand the neural underpinnings of reduced processing speed in this population.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To determine which regions underlie processing speed in pediatric-onset MS individuals compared to healthy controls using the fMRI-SDMT. In addition, to investigate the relationship between fMRI-SDMT blood-oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) activation patterns and behavioural performance on this task.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Data were collected from 23 right-handed individuals aged 13-24 with pediatric-onset relapsing-remitting MS (mean age=18, 16 female, mean disease duration=62 months, median EDSS=1.5) and 16 healthy controls matched by age, sex and socio-economic status. All participants underwent a 3.0 Tesla MRI scan which included structural acquisitions (T<sub>1</sub>, T<sub>2</sub>, PD, FLAIR) and the fMRI-SDMT. Briefly, this paradigm requires participants to indicate with a button press whether a single pairing of a symbol to a number matches any of those shown in a key above displaying 9 such pairings. Response time and accuracy were recorded. fMRI data were analyzed using mixed-effects general linear models with FSL&#x02019;s FEAT software.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Groups did not differ on the fMRI-SDMT with respect to response time (<italic>t</italic>=&#x02212;.236, <italic>p</italic>=.815) or percent accuracy (Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic>=145, <italic>p</italic>=.495). The pediatric MS group demonstrated higher overall activation compared to the healthy controls in the following regions: (i) right precuneus (z=3.43, p&#x0003c; .001), (ii) right superior lateral occipital (z=3.12, p=.002), (iii) right lingual gyrus (z=3.12, p=.002) and (iv) left superior parietal (z=3.06, p=.002). Within the pediatric MS group, faster response time was associated with greater activation of the left cerebellum (z=3.96, p&#x0003c; .001), bilateral precentral gyrus (z=3.07, p=.002), thalamus (z=3.57, p=.008), and left supramarginal gyrus (z=3.97, p=.0241).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Information processing speed performance is reliant on the recruitment of a greater number of parietal and occipital regions in pediatric MS. This may help offset deficits in processing speed given that performance was overall not impaired in this group. In the pediatric MS group, greater activation was associated with better/ faster cognitive performance suggesting that fMRI could potentially be used as a marker for adaptive functional reorganization.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section261-1352458514546077"><title>P129</title><sec id="section262-1352458514546077"><title>Longitudinal MRI and neuropsychological assessment of patients with clinically isolated syndrome</title><p><underline>T Uher</underline><sup>1,2</sup>, J Blahova-Dusankova<sup>1</sup>, D Horakova<sup>1</sup>, N Bergsland<sup>2,3</sup>, M Tyblova<sup>1</sup>, RHB Benedict<sup>2</sup>, T Kalincik<sup>4,5</sup>, DP Ramasamy<sup>2</sup>, Z Seidl<sup>6</sup>, J Hagemeier<sup>2</sup>, M Vaneckova<sup>6</sup>, J Krasensky<sup>6</sup>, E Havrdova<sup>1</sup>, R Zivadinov<sup>2,7</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Charles University in Prague, First Faculty of Medicine and General University Hospital, Department of Neurology and Center of Clinical Neuroscience, Prague, Czech Republic, <sup>2</sup>School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, University at Buffalo, State University of New York, Buffalo Neuroimaging Analysis Center, Department of Neurology, Buffalo, NY, United States, <sup>3</sup>IRCCS &#x0201c;S.Maria Nascente&#x0201d;, Don Gnocchi Foundation, Milan, Italy, <sup>4</sup>Melbourne Brain Centre, University of Melbourne, Department of Medicine, Melbourne, Australia, <sup>5</sup>Royal Melbourne Hospital, Department of Neurology, Melbourne, Australia, <sup>6</sup>Charles University in Prague, First Faculty of Medicine and General University Hospital, Department of Radiology, Prague, Czech Republic, <sup>7</sup>School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, University at Buffalo, State University of New York, MR Imaging Clinical Translational Research Center, Buffalo, NY, United States</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Cognitive impairment (CI) may occur in clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) patients.

Significant differences in absolute change of T2-lesion volume (p = .0003) and percent change of whole brain (p = .002), gray matter (p = .009), cortex (p = .009) and lateral ventricle volumes (p = .0001) were detected between clinically definite MS and stable CIS group over 24 months. No significant difference in development of CI was detected between stable CIS patients and those who developed CDMS. In multivariate regression and mixed-effect model analyses, no significant relationship was found between NP and MRI parameters.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The present study showed lack of cognitive deterioration in the majority of the CIS subjects treated with disease modifying drugs over the 2-years follow-up. In contrast, the CIS patients who converted to CDMS developed global and regional brain atrophy. The findings from this study show that structural MRI outcomes are not strongly associated with cognitive status, a phenomenon formerly described as cognitive-pathological dissociation. The lack of significant relationship between MRI metrics and cognition in this group of CIS patients could be attributed to several factors including the cognitive reserve, brain plasticity, effect of disease-modifyng therapy and relatively short follow-up period.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section263-1352458514546077"><title>P130</title><sec id="section264-1352458514546077"><title>Perservation of GM volume is related to increased learning effect on PASAT in patients with CIS</title><p><underline>T Uher</underline><sup>1,2</sup>, RH Benedict<sup>2</sup>, D Horakova<sup>1</sup>, N Bergsland<sup>2,3</sup>, J Blahova-Dusankova<sup>1</sup>, M Tyblova<sup>1</sup>, DP Ramasamy<sup>2</sup>, Z Seidl<sup>4</sup>, M Vaneckova<sup>4</sup>, J Krasensky<sup>4</sup>, E Havrdova<sup>1</sup>, R Zivadinov<sup>2,5</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Charles University in Prague, First Faculty of Medicine and General University Hospital, Department of Neurology and Center of Clinical Neuroscience, Prague, Czech Republic, <sup>2</sup>School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, University at Buffalo, State University of New York, Buffalo Neuroimaging Analysis Center, Department of Neurology, Buffalo, NY, United States, <sup>3</sup>IRCCS &#x0201c;S.Maria Nascente&#x0201d;, Don Gnocchi Foundation, Milan, Italy, <sup>4</sup>Charles University in Prague, First Faculty of Medicine and General University Hospital, Department of Radiology, Prague, Czech Republic, <sup>5</sup>School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, University at Buffalo, State University of New York, MR Imaging Clinical Translational Research Center, Buffalo, NY, United States</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Repeated administration of Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test-3 (PASAT) results in considerable learning effect in short- or long-term follow-up studies.

There was also a trend for the association between higher corpus callosum (CC) area at baseline and increased PASAT score absolute change over 48 months (p = .046).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The present study showed the relationship between increased learning effect on PASAT and lower GM volume loss in CIS patients on DMT. These findings suggest that treatment strategies oriented toward GM volume preservation may play an important role in prevention of cognitive deterioration in CIS patients.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section265-1352458514546077"><title>P131</title><sec id="section266-1352458514546077"><title>Effectively assessing executive function impairment in MS: comparisons of the Delis-Kaplan executive function system and Wisconsin card sorting tests</title><p><underline>L Glukhovsky</underline><sup>1</sup>, ES Gromisch<sup>1</sup>, G Hoffnung<sup>1</sup>, S Flood<sup>1</sup>, FW Foley<sup>1,2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Yeshiva University, Ferkauf Graduate School of Psychology, Bronx, NY, United States, <sup>2</sup>Holy Name Medical Center Multiple Sclerosis Center, Teaneck, NJ, United States</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Cognitive impairment has been estimated to affect 45-65% of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), with deficits in executive function among the most common cognitive features. Affected patients may experience difficulties in problem solving, decision-making, judgment, task-shifting, strategic planning, and organizational abilities. Such critical skills require sensitive and specific neuropsychological assessments to identify impairment; however, few studies have compared these assessments for their efficacy in detecting executive functioning deficits.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> This study aimed to compare the sensitivity and specificity of two commonly used assessments for executive function impairment in MS: the Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System Sorting Test (DST) and Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST).</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> The DST and WCST were administered to 121 participants at a large outpatient medical center in Teaneck, NJ. All participants signed research consents and had been diagnosed previously with MS. A receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was conducted to compare T scores from both tests (DST Confirmed Correct Sorts, CCS; WCST Percent Errors, PE) against a composite T score based on the Minimal Assessment of Cognitive Function in MS (MACFIMS). Frequencies were also calculated to compare the number of participants the DST and WCST identified as impaired.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> ROC analysis revealed similar levels of sensitivity and specificity in the DST and WCST for identifying impaired executive function. At 1.5 standard deviations (SD) down from the mean, the DST CCS measure yielded a classification accuracy of 82%, and the WCST PE yielded a classification accuracy of 79%. At 2.0 SD down from the mean, the DST CCS measure yielded a classification accuracy of 88%, and the WCST PE measure yielded a classification accuracy of 91%. Frequency calculations revealed that at the -1.5 SD criterion, 9% of participants showed impairment on the DST CCS and 21% showed impairment on the WCST PE. At the -2.0 SD criterion, 2% of participants showed impairment on the DST CCS and 13% showed impairment on the WCST PE.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The DST and WCST were found to be similarly effective in classifying executive function impairment among patients with MS. However, the DST holds an advantage over the WCST because it has several forms to accommodate longitudinal patient retesting. This research provides valuable information about prevalence rates and effective assessment of executive function impairment in MS.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section267-1352458514546077"><title>P132</title><sec id="section268-1352458514546077"><title>Brief International Cognitive Assessment for MS (BICAMS): preliminary findings from the Canadian validation study</title><p><underline>LAS Walker</underline><sup>1</sup>, L Osman<sup>2</sup>, JA Berard<sup>2</sup>, LM Rees<sup>1</sup>, D Cousineau<sup>3</sup>, H MacLean<sup>4</sup>, MS Freedman<sup>4</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>The Ottawa Hospital, Psychology, Ottawa, ON, Canada, <sup>2</sup>Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, Ottawa, ON, Canada, <sup>3</sup>University of Ottawa, Psychology, Ottawa, ON, Canada, <sup>4</sup>The Ottawa Hospital, Neurology, Ottawa, ON, Canada</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> The Brief International Cognitive Assessment for MS (BICAMS) was developed by a panel of experts as a brief, cognitive assessment for MS that can be used in centers with staff members who may not have neuropsychological training. The BICAMS tests were chosen on the basis of their sensitivity to deficits in MS, psychometric properties (reliability, validity), international application, ease and speed of administration, feasibility in the specified context, and acceptability to patients. There is a global initiative to validate BICAMS across cultures in order to establish it as a useful cognitive outcome measure that will foster international collaboration.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> The primary goal was to validate BICAMS in an English-speaking Canadian sample by establishing its ability to differentiate between individuals with MS and healthy controls. In addition, test-retest reliability was examined.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Thirty-three individuals (8 males, 25 females) with a confirmed diagnosis of MS (25 relapsing-remitting, 5 secondary progressive, 3 primary progressive) were compared to 22 healthy controls (HC) (4 males, 18 females) on BICAMS performance. Results are preliminary given that recruitment efforts are ongoing. BICAMS includes three subtests: Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT), California Verbal Learning Test - II (CVLT-II; learning trails), and Brief Visuospatial Memory Test - Revised (BVMT-R; learning trials).

Of these, 24 gave consent for inclusion in the study along with 13 sex- and age-matched non-benign MS (n-BMS) patients with RR course, DD&#x02265;10 years and EDSS score from 2.5 to 4.5.

This battery evaluates verbal memory acquisition and delayed recall, visual memory acquisition and delayed recall, attention, concentration, visual precision search, information processing speed, working memory and verbal fluency. A Spanish version of the BRB-N with two parallel forms of the test, as well as normative data for Spanish population is available.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> The aim of the present study was to study the psychometric properties of the Spanish version A of the BRB-N as well as to find out predictive values for Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis (RRMS) patients according to their EDSS disability degree.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Observational, cross-sectional and multicenter study. Enrollment period started in July 2012 and finished in October 2013. The stability of the scores was analyzed with the Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) between the results of the first visit and those from the retest visit (n=56 patients). The study also analyzed the Spearman correlation coefficients between BRB-N battery, EQ-5D questionnaire and the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) scores. Finally, the predictive validity of the battery was evaluated by sensitivity and specificity values using the disability groups (1=mild disability; 0=moderate disability) as Gold Standard.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> 291 RRMS patients from 21 Neurology Departments in Spain were included. The mild disability group (EDSS 0-3) included 152 (52.20%) patients and the moderate disability group (EDSS 3.5-5.5) included 139 patients (47.80%). There was a high correlation between test scores and retest (ICC=0.96).

Childhood demyelination may manifest as a monophasic illness or, in 25% of patients, may represent the first attack of multiple sclerosis (MS). Although cognitive impairment (CI) has been well described in pediatric MS, previous studies have suggested that a subset of children with monophasic demyelination may also suffer from CI in the areas of fine-motor and visual-motor skills, attention, memory, and processing speed.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> This study examined the association between neurocognitive outcomes and the presence of T2 lesions of the brain six months after an incident demyelinating event.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> 34 consecutive children were recruited from two tertiary Canadian children&#x02019;s hospitals, aged 7-13 (mean=12.3 &#x000b1; 2.6). Patients underwent standardized clinical and MRI examinations and cognitive testing six-months after onset. MRI scans of the brain were assessed for the presence of T2-weighted lesions using a binary classification. A valid MRI was not available for 9 of the patients. Patients with &#x02265;1 brain lesion (n=11) versus no lesions (n=14) on MRI were compared on measures assessing: attention and speed of processing; working memory; vocabulary; visual-motor integration; verbal learning and memory.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Mean scores across all neuropsychological tests fell within the average range with only 4 (12%) or fewer patients performing 1.5 SDs below normative values on any one test. None of the patients were identified as having CI as based on overall performance on the battery. Patients with visible brain lesions did not differ from those without on any of the cognitive outcomes. Of the 34 patients, 11 now have a diagnosis of MS.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Neurocognitive impairment was not seen in this cohort of children with a single demyelinating episode evaluated 6 months after symptom onset. It is of note that all children, whether or not they eventually received the diagnosis of MS or had brain lesions, scored in the normal range- suggesting that cognitive impairment is not a feature of monophasic demyelination nor is it detected extremely early in MS. Further work will determine whether more sensitive cognitive metrics reveal subtle deficits. Serial evaluation is required to determine the time course of cognitive impairment in MS. Finally, premorbid cognitive abilities, or cognitive reserve, may influence the ability to detect impairment in children tested close in time to incident ADS.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section279-1352458514546077"><title>P138</title><sec id="section280-1352458514546077"><title>Attention network efficiency and performance variability is associated with white matter microstructure in persons with multiple sclerosis</title><p><underline>MA Wojtowicz</underline><sup>1</sup>, EL Mazerolle<sup>2</sup>, A Omisade<sup>1</sup>, JD Fisk<sup>3</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Dalhousie University, Psychology and Neuroscience, Halifax, NS, Canada, <sup>2</sup>University of Calgary, Department of Radiology, Calgary, AB, Canada, <sup>3</sup>Dalhousie University, Psychology and Neuroscience, Psychiatry, Halifax, NS, Canada</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Impairments in attention and information processing speed are common in persons with multiple sclerosis (MS) and may contribute to impairments of other cognitive abilities.

Relations between ANT-I performance and DTI measures were examined by analyzing fractional anisotropy (FA) maps using tract-based spatial statistics.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> MS patients were slower and more variable in their performance of the ANT-I compared to controls (p&#x0003c; .05) but the groups did not differ in their attention network efficiency scores. No significant associations between FA and mean response speed were observed for either group. Control participants had no significant associations of FA values with performance variability or attention network efficiency. Amongst the MS patients, less variable performance was associated with higher FA values in the posterior thalamic radiation and the splenium of the corpus callosum. In addition, more efficient alerting network performance was associated with higher FA in the left external capsule and more efficient orienting network performance was associated with higher FA in multiple white matter regions, including: body/genu of corpus callosum, bilateral superior corona radiata, left anterior frontal regions, anterior corona radiata, and left external capsule. No significant association with executive network efficiency and FA were observed for MS patients.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> DTI measures of white matter microstructure appear sensitive to performance variability on timed tests of attention and information processing speed in persons with MS. Moreover, DTI may also allow for improved understanding of specific associations between cognitive processes such as alerting and orienting network efficiencies and white matter microstructure in persons with MS.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section281-1352458514546077"><title>P139</title><sec id="section282-1352458514546077"><title>The role of the cerebellum in cognitive test performance in children and adolescents with multiple sclerosis</title><p><underline>K Weier</underline><sup>1</sup>, C Till<sup>2,3</sup>, V Fonov<sup>1</sup>, EA Yeh<sup>3,4</sup>, DL Arnold<sup>1</sup>, B Banwell<sup>5</sup>, DL Collins<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>McGill University, Montreal Neurological Institute, Montreal, QC, Canada, <sup>2</sup>York University, Department of Psychology, Toronto, ON, Canada, <sup>3</sup>The Hospital for Sick Children, Neurosciences and Mental Health Program, Toronto, ON, Canada, <sup>4</sup>University of Toronto, Department of Pediatrics (Neurology), Toronto, ON, Canada, <sup>5</sup>University of Pennsylvania, Children&#x02019;s Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA, United States</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Pediatric-onset multiple sclerosis (MS) is often accompanied by cognitive impairment. Severity of cognitive dysfunction has been associated with neuroimaging features, including reduced thalamic and whole brain volume. The cerebellum is also affected in both pediatric- and adult-onset MS patients, though the functional impact of cerebellar pathology on cognition is not well understood.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To investigate the relationship between cerebellar volumes and cognitive function in children and adolescents with pediatric-onset MS.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> High resolution T1w RF-spoiled GRE scans (1.5T) of 29 consecutively recruited pediatric-onset relapsing remitting MS patients (22 girls; mean age 16.2y; mean disease duration 4.6y; median EDSS=1) were analysed cross-sectionally and compared to 35 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HC). Global and regional cerebellar volumes were generated automatically using RASCAL. Total cerebral volume was generated using BeAST. Cognitive function was assessed using Full scale IQ and Vocabulary subtest of the WASI (Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence), SDMT (Symbol Digit Modalities Test), VMI (Beery Visual Motor Integration), TMT-B (Trail Making Test - Part B), and the Grooved Pegboard test was used for motor function. Independent sample t-tests and hierarchical stepwise multiple linear regression (MLR) were used to examine associations between cognitive outcomes and cerebellar volumes after accounting for cerebral volume.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Performance on all cognitive and motor tests differed significantly between groups (MS worse than HC). Cerebellar volumes did not differ between groups [e.g. total cerebellar volume [mean (standard deviation) MS = 130cc (12.7), HC = 134cc (14.8); p=0.27], nor were they associated with duration of disease. However, in the MS group, lower cerebellar posterior lobe volume was associated with poorer SDMT performance, controlling for sex and cerebral volume (R<sup>2</sup>=0.54). The full model for the prediction of Vocabulary test scores (R<sup>2</sup>=0.67) included sex, cerebral volume and infratentorial lesion volume (LV).

Participants and an informant completed the MSNQ.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> At time 1 the only significant correlation was between MSNQ-I and BDI-FS (r = 0.42, p&#x0003c; .05). At time 2 MSNQ-S correlated with PHQ-9 (r = 0.39, p&#x0003c; .05) and MSNQ-I correlated with SDMT (r = &#x02212;.43, p&#x0003c; .05), ACT-9 (r = &#x02212;0.44, p&#x0003c; .05) and ACT-18 (r = &#x02212;0.43, p&#x0003c; .05). Both MSNQ-S (r = 0.83, p&#x0003c; .001) and MSNQ-I (r = 0.81, p&#x0003c; .001) showed high test-retest reliability.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Expected relationships between self-report cognition and mood; and informant-report cognition and objective cognition, were observed at time 2.

Fatigue can be experienced both centrally (cognitive) and peripherally (physical) and cognitive fatigue may manifest as both subjective sensations and/or objective changes in performance.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> The aim of the current investigation was to identify the task parameters associated with feelings of subjective cognitive fatigue in MS. A number of different predictions were tested against each other. The hypotheses were: 1) cognitive fatigue is a result of cognitive load, 2) cognitive fatigue is a result of cognitive domain or 3) cognitive fatigue is a function of time on task. An interactive cognitive fatigue hypothesis was also possible, whereby cognitive fatigue may result from an interaction between the different factors.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Thirty-three individuals with MS and 23 Healthy Controls participated. Experimental manipulation included Cognitive Domain (Processing Speed vs Working Memory), Cognitive Load (High vs Low), and Time (Block/Run 1, 2, 3, 4). Domain and Load were counterbalanced and manipulated within participants. Subjective cognitive fatigue was measured using a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for fatigue at baseline and after each Run.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Data analysis was completed using a 2 Group (MS vs Healthy Controls) x 2 Cognitive Domain x 2 Cognitive Load x 4 Run Mixed ANOVA. Subjective reports of cognitive fatigue on the VAS were higher for the Processing Speed task (p &#x0003c; . 001), increased across Runs (p &#x0003c; .001), and were higher in the MS group (p = .01). The significant Run by Group interaction (p = .02) revealed that the MS group reported higher subjective cognitive fatigue across time. Subjective cognitive fatigue was not correlated with objective cognitive fatigue (behavior; all p&#x02019;s = n.s).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Subjective cognitive fatigue was higher for both the MS and healthy control group in the processing speed task. Irrespective of cognitive load, subjective cognitive fatigue increased as a function of time on task and this effect was magnified for the MS group. Subjective cognitive fatigue was independent of objective cognitive fatigue. These findings support the hypothesis that subjective cognitive fatigue occurs in MS as a function of time on task.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section287-1352458514546077"><title>P142</title><sec id="section288-1352458514546077"><title>Response inhibition on a Go/No-go task in pediatric-onset multiple sclerosis patients: an fMRI study</title><p><underline>M Lysenko</underline><sup>1</sup>, N Akbar<sup>2</sup>, EA Yeh<sup>3</sup>, B Banwell<sup>3,4</sup>, C Till<sup>1,3</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>York University, Toronto, ON, Canada, <sup>2</sup>University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada, <sup>3</sup>The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, ON, Canada, <sup>4</sup>Children&#x02019;s Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA, United States</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Inhibitory control, defined as the ability to withhold a response, is typically preserved in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), despite impairment in other executive functions. The role of functional reorganization in the preservation of inhibitory control has been documented in adults with MS, but has received little attention in children and adolescents with MS.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> This study examined the concept of functional reorganization concerning inhibitory control using a simple Go/No-go (GNG) functional MRI paradigm in pediatric-onset MS.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Twenty pediatric-onset relapsing remitting MS patients (13 female; mean age = 19.4 &#x000b1; 3.0 years; mean disease duration = 5.1 &#x000b1; 3.1 years) and 17 age-and sex-matched healthy controls (14 female; mean age = 19.3 &#x000b1; 2.6 years) underwent a neuropsychological test battery and structural and functional imaging on a 3 T MRI scanner. Brain activation associated with response inhibition on an 8-minute GNG task was compared between the MS and control groups.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Patients and controls did not differ on any of the neuropsychological outcomes in the test battery, nor with respect to reaction time (<italic>p</italic> = 0.13) or accuracy (<italic>p</italic> = 0.87) on the GNG task. Patients who were younger at disease onset (r = 0.38, <italic>p</italic> = 0.054) and had a higher T1-weighted lesion volume (r = &#x02212;0.32, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.10) had lower accuracy on the GNG task, trending towards significance. Regarding brain activation, the control group demonstrated greater functional activation as compared with the patient group in several regions, including the cerebellum, brainstem, lateral occipital cortex, parahippocampal gyrus, precuneus, superior parietal lobe, precentral gyrus and superior frontal gyrus. Relative to the controls, the patient group did not show greater activation in any brain region.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Findings demonstrate that cognitively intact pediatric-onset MS patients show less brain activation than controls when inhibiting a simple motor response despite no differences in behavioural performance. Functional differences were observed in the posterior and anterior regions of the response inhibition network in the MS group that may suggest a less developed attention network. Further characterization of cerebellar-neocortical connectivity is required to understand the potential for functional plasticity in response to injury in pediatric-onset MS.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section289-1352458514546077"><title>P143</title><sec id="section290-1352458514546077"><title>Age of onset and cognitive reserve as moderators of cognitive decline in pediatric-onset multiple sclerosis patients</title><p><underline>C Till</underline><sup>1,2</sup>, B Hosseini<sup>1</sup>, D Flora<sup>1</sup>, BL Banwell<sup>3</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>York University, Psychology, Toronto, ON, Canada, <sup>2</sup>The Hospital for Sick Children, Neurosciences and Mental Health, Research Institute, Toronto, ON, Canada, <sup>3</sup>Children&#x02019;s Hospital of Philadelphia, Dept. of Neurology, Philadelphia, PA, United States</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Cognitive impairment is reported to occur in 30 to 50 per cent of pediatric-onset MS patients with difficulties in working memory and information processing commonly observed. Little is known about the long-term impact of the disease on cognitive development and how certain predictors may moderate cognitive outcomes.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To determine how age of disease onset and cognitive reserve impact the maturation of working memory and processing speed in pediatric-onset MS patients.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> This study collected serial cognitive data from 35 individuals with pediatric-onset MS with a focus on working memory and processing speed. Of the 35 participants, 7 completed only one assessment, 5 completed two assessments, 13 completed three assessments, 10 completed four or more assessments. Working memory was assessed by the Trails Making Test-Part B (TMT-B) and processing speed was assessed by the Symbol Digit Modalities (SDMT) - oral version. Growth curve modeling was used to assess cognitive trajectories over time and to examine how age at disease onset, baseline Full Scale IQ, and socioeconomic status may moderate rate of change.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Results showed that growth curves varied considerably across individuals. Younger age at disease onset was associated with a greater likelihood of cognitive decline on both the TMT-B (estimate = 0.06, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.02, <italic>p</italic> = 0.001) and SDMT (estimate = 0.48, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.16, <italic>p</italic> = 0.005). Proxies of cognitive reserve, including baseline IQ and parental socioeconomic status, did not predict cognitive outcome trajectories.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Findings suggest that younger age at disease-onset increases the vulnerability for disrupted development of working memory and processing speed. Proxies of cognitive reserve did not protect against the progression of decline on these specific cognitive measures. Young patients with MS should be advised to seek follow-up cognitive evaluation to assess cognitive maturation and to screen for the potential late emergence of cognitive deficits.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section291-1352458514546077"><title>P144</title><sec id="section292-1352458514546077"><title>Transfer of information across the corpus callosum is slowed in patients with multiple sclerosis compared to healthy controls</title><p><underline>J Bacon</underline><sup>1,2</sup>, T Bacon<sup>2</sup>, I Kister<sup>2</sup>, J Herbert<sup>2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Yeshiva University, Pscyhology, New York, NY, United States, <sup>2</sup>New York University School of Medicine, Neurology, New York, NY, United States</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> The corpus callosum, a heavily myelinated tract connecting the right and left hemispheres, is a frequent and early locus of disease activity in multiple sclerosis (MS) . We predicted that, relative to controls, MS subjects would have exaggerated delays in reaction times on a task that involved transcallosal transfer of visual information to the left hemisphere (LH) language area compared to a task with no callosal transfer.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To compare differences in reaction time between patients with MS and healthy controls on a task that involves transfer of information from one hemisphere to the other and a task that does not involve transcallosal transfer.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> MS patients were divided into three disability strata: No Disability (ND), EDSS=0-1, n=19; Mild Disability (MilD), EDSS=1.5-3.5, n=39; and Moderate Disability (MoD), EDSS=4-6.5, n=10. 22 healthy volunteers served as controls. A trial consisted of a three-letter word presented for 150 milliseconds to either the right visual field (RVF) or left visual field (LVF). Subjects were required to speak the word as quickly as possible and reaction time of articulation (RTA) was recorded. Since a word presented to the RVF projects to the LH, ipsilateral to Broca&#x02019;s area, RTAs should be faster than for a word presented to the LVF, which projects to the right hemisphere, contralateral to the LH language area. We predicted RVF/LVF differences would be exaggerated in MS subjects compared to controls. Data were analyzed using distribution-free non-parametric statistics. A difference score (DS) was computed for each subject by taking the difference between the median RTA for LVF and RVF word presentations.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> In accordance with Dunn&#x02019;s procedure, we first showed a significant overall effect between groups using the Kruskal-Wallis test (p&#x0003c; 0.001). We then compared the control group to each of the MS groups using the Mann Whitney U. DS for controls (Mdn=18.8) was not significantly different from the ND group (Mdn= 12.8), U = 159.0, p = 0.19, but was significantly different from the MilD group (Mdn=36.3), U = 286.0, p = .032, r =0.28, and the MOD group (Mdn=52.5), U = 21.0, p &#x0003c; 001, r = 0.64.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Compared to controls, MS subjects exhibited longer time to articulation when a stimulus was presented to the hemisphere contralateral to the language area.

This stage could be particularly relevant to study the early mechanisms of CI in multiple sclerosis (MS). Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) allows to study white matter tracts integrity and to examine the association between cognition and diffuse tissue pathology.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To study anatomical connectivity abnormalities associated with CI in CIS patients by using DTI with Tract-Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS) analysis.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Twenty-four CIS patients and 71 healthy controls (HC) matched for age, gender and educational level, were assessed by neuropsychological testing of information processing speed (IPS), attention, executive functions (EF)working memory (WM) and episodic memory (EM). All patients and 31 HC underwent 3 T MRI including DTI. A global cognitive (GC) composite z-score and a z-score for each cognitive domain were calculated. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity mapping were derived from DTI data by using FSL software. The &#x0201c;skeleton&#x0201d; of intracerebral connexion bundles was established using the TBSS method. Maps of the FA voxel-based correlations with cognitive z scores will be determined by TBSS. Prior to the voxel-wise analysis, group comparison was made between the whole-brain TBSS skeleton mean FA for CIS patients and HC. MRI and neuropsychological parameters between HC and patients were compared. Correlations between the DTI measures and the cognitive performances were studied in CIS patients.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> CI was detected in 47.6 % of CIS patients (&#x0003e;=3 tests of the battery failed). A small significant difference in the whole-brain TBSS skeleton mean FA was demonstrated between CIS patients (0.32 &#x000b1;0.17) and HC (0.33 &#x000b1;0.18) (p&#x0003c; 0.05). GC z-score and mean FA correlated significantly (p&#x0003c; 0.05) in CIS patients with a significant FA reduction particularly in superior longitudinal fasciculus, corpus callosum, internal capsule, posterior thalamic radiation and brainstem. IPS z score correlated significantly with FA reduction (p&#x0003c; 0.05) in the same tracts on CIS patients.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Cognitive impairment correlate with white matter integrity at the very early stages of MS.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section295-1352458514546077"><title>P146</title><sec id="section296-1352458514546077"><title>CTIP performance in early relapsing-remitting MS: group differences and potential confounds</title><p><underline>LAS Walker</underline><sup>1,2</sup>, JA Berard<sup>2</sup>, LI Berrigan<sup>3</sup>, LM Rees<sup>1,2</sup>, MS Freedman<sup>4,5</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>The Ottawa Hospital, Psychology, Ottawa, ON, Canada, <sup>2</sup>University of Ottawa, Psychology, Ottawa, ON, Canada, <sup>3</sup>Dalhousie University, Psychology, Halifax, NS, Canada, <sup>4</sup>The Ottawa Hospital, MS Clinic, Ottawa, ON, Canada, <sup>5</sup>University of Ottawa, Neurology, Ottawa, ON, Canada</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> The Computerized Test of Information Processing (CTIP) is a sensitive measure of information processing speed deficits in multiple sclerosis (MS) and has been demonstrated to be more palatable to those with MS than other available measures.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> The current goal was to determine if performance differences are detectable early in the disease. The impact of language, subjective fatigue, depression, and motor speed on performance was also examined.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Seventy individuals with early-phase relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) were compared to 72 matched healthy controls on CTIP performance. The CTIP includes three subtests: simple reaction time (SRT), choice reaction time (CRT) and semantic search reaction time (SSRT).</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> With the exception of slower performance by the MS group on SRT, no group differences were detected. With regard to potential confounds, CTIP performance was not affected by depression. Language performance (i.e. semantic retrieval) correlated with SSRT in both groups and CRT in controls. Fatigue impacted all subtests in both groups with the exception of SRT in controls. Motor speed also impacted performance on all subtests in both groups, although this effect can be largely removed by scores which subtract out SRT (i.e. motor speed).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> In contrast to findings with a general MS sample, group differences in processing speed were not detected in these mildly affected individuals. The differences detected between groups on processing speed measures in past research may be due to the influence of other cognitive processes (i.e. working memory), as well as the fact that our sample was earlier in the disease process. Current findings demonstrated that performance on the CTIP is influenced not only by processing speed, but also some aspects of language given that CRT and SSRT correlated with semantic retrieval. Increased subjective fatigue is associated with poorer CTIP performance. Lastly, individuals with slower motor speed are vulnerable to poorer CTIP performance. Nonetheless, scoring options allow for some control of this. Thus, when interpreting CTIP performance, clinicians must consider the potential influence of other factors aside from processing speed alone.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section297-1352458514546077"><title>P147</title><sec id="section298-1352458514546077"><title>Does cognitive impairment, fatigue, depression or physical disability influence computer assisted tests for driving performance in MS patients?</title><p><underline>S Gierer</underline><sup>1</sup>, E Kannam&#x000fc;ller<sup>1</sup>, S Gierer<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Neurologische Gemeinschaftspraxis Dillingen, Dillingen an der Donau, Germany</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> MS patients suffering from physical disability, fatigue, cognitive impairment or depression may be affected in their ability to drive.

The EDSS and the time since disease onset was determined for each patient. Patients who received steroids in the previous 4 weeks and patients suffering from impairment of motor function leading to decrease of reaction capabilities were excluded.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> 41% of patients showed an impaired performance in 2 or more of the 5 tests of driving fitness, which was specified as &#x0201c;impaired driving performance&#x0201d; (IDP). High EDSS (r= &#x02212;0,41, p&#x0003c; 0,01), cognitive impairment (r=0,34, p&#x0003c; 0,01), duration of the disease (r=&#x02212;0,29, p&#x0003c; 0,01) and fatigue (r=&#x02212;0,25, p&#x0003c; 0,05) were predictors of IDP whereas depression was not. In a logistic regression model with IDP as the outcome and age, depression, fatigue syndrome, EDSS, duration of disease and cognitive impairment as independent variables in the model, the only significant predictors were EDSS (p&#x0003c; 0,01) and impaired cognition (p&#x0003c; 0,05).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The amount of MS patients missing criteria for ability to drive in computer based tests is high. Since some of the tests depend on reaction time it is evident that a higher EDSS results in insufficient test performance. However, cognitive deficits are an independent predictor for IDP, so that physical disability is only one part of the story. In the individual patient, deficits have to be explored in detail. Testing of driving skills by a driving instructor or by using a driving simulator may help to determine the ability to drive in the individual patient.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section299-1352458514546077"><title>P148</title><sec id="section300-1352458514546077"><title>Inhibitory control in early multiple sclerosis</title><p><underline>L Crivelli</underline><sup>1</sup>, MF Farez<sup>1</sup>, RF Allegri<sup>1</sup>, MP Fiol<sup>1</sup>, MC Ysrraelit<sup>1</sup>, J Correale<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Institute for Neurological Research Dr. Ra&#x000fa;l Carrea (FLENI), Buenos Aires, Argentina</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Cognitive impairment can be present early on in the course of MS. Executive functions are among the most frequently affected cognitive domains. However, executive functioning has not been studied thoroughly during initial stages of MS. Inhibitory control, a key component of executive function, is defined as the capacity to suppress inappropriate or unnecessary behavior, promoting flexible responses to changing environments. Given the fact that MS patients may present frontal lesions with white matter involvement affecting frontal lobe tracts during early stages of the disease, we hypothesize that inhibitory control is impaired in MS patients.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> The purpose of this study is to characterize inhibitory function in patients with early MS.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Patients were recruited from the outpatient MS clinic at the Raul Carrea Institute for Neurological Research (FLENI) by attending neurologists. Twenty-nine relapsing-remitting MS patients, ful&#x0fb01;lling 2005 McDonald criteria, with less than 2 years disease duration and scores &#x02264;2 on EDSS, were included. Twenty-nine subjects matched for age, gender, and educational level, recruited from a local volunteer group, served as controls. Both groups underwent complete neuropsychological evaluation. Inhibitory control was assessed using a computerized test (STOP-IT). The local ethics committee approved the protocol and all subjects signed an informed consent form.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> In line with previous reports, patients and controls differed significantly in scores obtained for the following tests: attention (Digit Symbol Test p=0.003); verbal memory (Selective Memory Test p=0.004); language (Verbal Fluency p=0.001); and executive function (PASAT3 sec. p=0.004, WAIS III Digits backwards p=0.03). Furthermore, when tested with STOP-IT, patients presented a 33.37 msec delay in inhibition of response, compared to controls (p=0.032). Although patients took longer to inhibit response, no differences were observed in likelihood of achieving response inhibition, between patients and controls (p=0.4).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Patients with recent MS diagnosis present specific inhibitory control deficits. Inhibitory control is an important component of executive functions and when altered, can have significant impact on patients&#x02019; quality of life. Careful dissection of executive function into its basic components, combined with analysis of impaired domains can help individualize the design of cognitive rehabilitation strategies.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section301-1352458514546077"><title>P149</title><sec id="section302-1352458514546077"><title>Accuracy of clinical screening for cognitive impairment in multiple sclerosis: an empirical study</title><p>G Hoffnung<sup>1</sup>, L Glukhovsky<sup>1</sup>, S Flood<sup>1</sup>, J Botvinick<sup>1</sup>, J Sloan<sup>1</sup>, <underline>FW Foley</underline><sup>1,2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Yeshiva University, Bronx, NY, United States, <sup>2</sup>Holy Name Medical Center, Teaneck, NJ, United States</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Cognitive dysfunction is a frequently occurring symptom of multiple sclerosis (MS) and it has become an increasingly important focus of MS medical care in recent decades. While empirical studies have found that approximately 50% of MS patients are at risk for cognitive impairment, it is difficult under normal clinical conditions to identify those who are at risk for cognitive impairment and should be referred for neuropsychological testing.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> There is sparse literature on validated methods for physician screening of cognitive symptoms in MS and little has been published regarding the accuracy of current physician screening. The present study seeks to examine the accuracy of physician referral for neuropsychological testing for cognitive impairments.

If confirmed, this study seeks to point further toward the need for the development of quick and accurate screening tools in the clinical setting.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> The study considered a group of MS patients (n= 187) from a large outpatient medical center who were referred by physicians for further neuropsychological testing in response to physician examination/screening. Referred patients&#x02019; cognitive functioning was assessed using the MACFIMS (minimal assessment of cognitive function in multiple sclerosis) battery (Benedict, et al., 2002) and the presence of objective cognitive impairment was determined based on the criteria of Benedict and colleagues (2006).</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Of the 187 patients referred by physicians for testing, only 100 (53.5%) displayed objective cognitive impairment while 87 (46.5%) did not display cognitive impairments, numbers that are statistically equivalent with what would be predicted from a random sampling.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The findings of the study are preliminary, but suggest low accuracy in physician referral for the detection of objective cognitive impairments in MS. This study highlights the need for the development of reliable and valid screening tools that can be quickly administered in the busy clinic setting. One recent study found that an abbreviated California Verbal Learning Test-II (CVLT-II) that takes approximately 3 minutes to administer can accurately detect verbal memory problems in MS (Gromisch et al, 2013).

Impairment was defined as a score of 1.5 SD below the normal population mean score for the total ARCS or on any scaled domain score.

The cohort was 81% female with an average disease duration of 8+0.4 years, mean age at diagnosis of 38.1+0.6 years and 71% had education to the senior secondary or tertiary education levels. 138 of RRMS were followed up over a mean time of 31 months (min 9m, max 72m). 87 RRMS patients were rated impaired at baseline. 71% of these deteriorated during follow up: 37% of patients experienced decline in memory, 41% in fluency, 8% in visual, 36% in attention, 12% in language and 26% in total ARCs. Of the group receiving treatment during follow up, only 37% had a decline in fluency compared to 64.3% in the non-treatment group (P=0.028). After adjusting for the effects of age, gender, education and time between visits the effect of treatment on the fluency domain remained significant (P=0.05). Scores in the fluency domain were associated with disease duration, education and EDSS.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The ARCS detected changes in the main domains affected by MS. In this non-controlled patient group an effect of treatment was observed in the fluency domain. Larger studies over a prolonged period are required to determine whether disease modifying treatment attenuate cognitive decline.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section305-1352458514546077"><title>P151</title><sec id="section306-1352458514546077"><title>Self-reported episodic memory and future thinking and their relation to cerebral structure in early multiple sclerosis patients</title><p><underline>GO Nygaard</underline><sup>1,2</sup>, KB Walhovd<sup>3</sup>, AM Fjell<sup>3</sup>, NI Landr&#x000f8;<sup>3</sup>, J-L Chepkoech<sup>3</sup>, EG Celius<sup>1</sup>, HF Harbo<sup>1,2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Oslo University Hospital, Department of Neurlogy, Oslo, Norway, <sup>2</sup>University of Oslo, Faculty of Medicine, Oslo, Norway, <sup>3</sup>University of Oslo, Institute of Psychology, Oslo, Norway</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Self-reported episodic memory may be affected in relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS), but it is not clear whether it is related to cerebral structure after controlling for depression and fatigue. Self-reported memory, the quality of episodic memories and future thinking may be related.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To examine episodic memory and future thinking in early RRMS patients and to investigate whether cortical and subcortical structures relate to these functions.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> RRMS patients diagnosed within the last three years (n=60) and matched healthy controls (n=60) underwent MRI and neuropsychological testing, including Past Time Travel (PTT) and Future Time Travel (FTT), (experimental tests of the quality of episodic memory and future thinking, scored on a likert scale from least to most vivid imaginations 0-5), filled in the Everyday Memory Questionnnaire (EMQ, scored on a likert-like scale from most seldom to most common memory problems 1-9), fatigue severity scale (FSS) and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI).

Both EMQ and FTT correlated with FSS and BDI, thus these factors were added as covariates in the analyses. The patients had smaller cortical volumes and smaller volumes of thalamus, putamen, caudate nuclei and pallidum bilaterally, but similar hippocampal and intracranial volumes, compared to the controls. Preliminar results show that higher EMQ and FTT were associated with a larger surface area of a region of the left lateral occipital and inferior parietal lobe, and a larger cortical volume in the same region for FTT. Subcortical structures were not associated with EMQ, FTT or PTT.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> In this early RRMS patient sample EMQ was similar to healthy controls and was related to PTT. Preliminar results indicate that higher EMQ and FTT were associated with a larger surface area of the same cortical region.

The Brief International Cognitive Assessment for Multiple Sclerosis (BICAMS), which includes a test of IPS, the Symbol Digit Modalities test (SDMT), and 2 tests of EM, is easy to use but does not detect all patients with CI. Quick and patients-friendly ecological tasks in a virtual environment (VE) are promising.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To compare a short battery including two tests of the BICAMS and a VE task to a large comprehensive NP battery.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> A sample of 28 PwMS with cognitive complaints and at least two three cognitive tests impaired at a large NP battery were matched to 19 healthy controls (HC).</p><p>The large battery (A) included 13 paper-pencil NP tests of IPS, EM, WM, EF and attention and several computerized tasks from the Test of Attentional Performance (TAP). The short battery (B) included the SDMT, the immediate recall score of the California Verbal Learning Test and an in-house developed task assessing divided attention in a VE: the Urban Daily Cog&#x000a9;. The percentages of cognitively impaired patients at the B battery (at least 1 test &#x0003c; 1.5 standard deviation (SD) of HC) and at the A battery (at least 3 tests &#x0003c; 1.5 SD of HC) were calculated.

Patients were categorized as presenting an overt or incipient CD if they scored &#x0003e;2 standard deviation (SD), or &#x0003e;1 SD but &#x0003c; /=2 SD below the Italian normative mean of SDMT, respectively. Postural sway was estimated using a force platform (ProKin PK254P, Tecnobody) by asking patients to maintain their balance for 30s as steady as possible under eyes opened (single-task) and while performing the Stroop word-colour task (dual-task). Dual-task cost (DTC) was calculated as percentage change from single- to dual-task condition. The association between CD and DTC was investigated by an ANCOVA model.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Eighty-five patients (55 F, 30 M), with a mean (SD) age of 39.2 (10.2) years, mean (SD) MS duration of 12.4 (8.6) years and median [range] Expanded Disability Status of 3.0 [1.0-6.0] were tested. Of them, 28 (32.9%) and 21 (24.7%) presented an overt and incipient CD, respectively. Patients with either overt and incipient CD were older and more disabled than cognitively intact (CI) ones (p&#x0003c; 0.05). Patients with overt CD had also longer MS duration (p&#x0003c; 0.001) and slower walking speed (p=0.021) than CI ones. There were no differences between patients with overt and incipient CD.</p><p>There was a significant effect of CD on DTC after controlling for gender, age, education, MS duration, EDSS score, single-task postural sway, fatigue and walking speed (F=6.856, p=0.002).

Subjective cognitive difficulties were assessed via the cognition subscale of the Health Utilities Index-3 (HUI-3) and a difference &#x0003e;0.05 on this single attribute utility was used to classify participants as reporting worsened, stable, or improved cognition between assessments.

When changes in HUI-3 cognition ratings were examined, 200 (57.3%) participants reported stable cognition, 71 (20.3%) reported worsening and 78 (22.3%) reported improvement. A one-way ANOVA revealed no difference between groups on changes in SDMT performance (F(2,346)=0.337, p&#x0003e;0.05) but differences were found between the stable, worsened and improved groups on HADS ratings of anxiety (F(2,346)=6.206, p&#x0003c; 0.003) and depression (F(2,346)=4.435, p&#x0003c; 0.014). Tukey&#x02019;s post-hoc tests revealed that relative to those who reported stable cognition, those who reported worsened cognition had increased ratings of anxiety and those who reported improved cognition had lessened anxiety. Those who reported worsened cognition also had increased ratings of depression relative to those who reported improved cognition.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Subjective cognitive difficulties are common among clinic-attending MS patients.

In addition to examining traditional structural markers of neurodegeneration (e.g., atrophy), recent work in our laboratory has assessed cerebral glutathione (GSH), a neuroprotective antioxidant that is diminished in MS patients. The present study examined associations between cognitive performance in MS and both structural and GSH measures obtained through magnetic resonance imaging.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To assess group differences for MS patients and healthy controls (HC) on neuropsychological measures; and to examine correlations between test performance and lesion volume (LV), brain parenchymal fraction (BPF), grey matter fraction (GMF), white matter fraction (WMF), and GSH.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> 52 MS patients and 21 HC were administered the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT), Tower of London (TOL), Stroop, Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT), and Brief Visuospatial Memory Test (BVMT). Testing was followed by a series of neuroimaging and spectroscopy scans.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Patients performed worse than HC on all measures of processing speed (all ps&#x0003c; .05). Patients also performed worse on initial learning trials of the RAVLT (p=.02) and BVMT (p=.02), and had poorer scores on immediate recall and delayed recognition (ps=.04). No differences were observed in executive function. BPF and particularly GMF were most strongly aligned with test performance, with robust correlations observed on nearly all measures and Pearson&#x02019;s r ranging between .33 and .65 for GMF. LV and WMF were less strongly related to test performance. Correlations with GSH measures were smaller than those involving GMF and BPF; however, modest correlations were observed for GSH levels on the RAVLT, SDMT, and BVMT.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Cognitive impairment in processing speed and learning efficiency is highly correlated with BPF and particularly GMF, and modestly correlated with GSH. Results provide further evidence for neurodegeneration as the most likely process underlying cognitive impairment in MS. Relations between cognitive measures and GSH may be limited by the dynamic nature of this imaging measure. Further investigation is warranted to determine molecular mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section317-1352458514546077"><title>P157</title><sec id="section318-1352458514546077"><title>The efficacy of Wechsler Memory Scale-fourth edition (WMS-IV) in memory evaluation in multiple sclerosis patients</title><p><underline>CT Spedo</underline><sup>1,2</sup>, MP Foss<sup>1</sup>, DA Pereira<sup>2</sup>, RM Conde<sup>1</sup>, TR Brozinga<sup>1</sup>, VD Marques<sup>1</sup>, AA Barreira<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Ribeir&#x000e3;o Preto Medical School, Neuroscience and Behavior Sciences, Ribeir&#x000e3;o Preto, Brazil, <sup>2</sup>Brazilian Institute of Neuroscience (IBNeuro), Bras&#x000ed;lia, Brazil</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> The WMS-IV is gold standard in memory assessment.

The scale allows us to obtain raw, index and contrast scaled scores.

The MS-RR patients had more impaired ability to recall orally presented information and ability to recall and manipulate the visual information than controls. Nevertheless, their visual memory index is worse than their auditory index. The patients with MS had memory problems associated with delayed memory performance when compared with healthy people with similar immediate memory performance, noticing that patients present impaired capacity of consolidation. The free recall of non-verbal informations indicates that MS-RR had lower capacity to free recall non-verbal informations learned, suggesting that MS-RR benefits himself with tip.

DMT included interferons, glatiramer acetate and natalizumab. Age and gender matched healthy controls (HC) (n=32) were recruited from the Hunter Medical Research Institute community database. Each participant underwent cognition testing (Audio Recorded Cognition Screen - ARCS and Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test-PASAT) with the self- reported fatigue (Modified Fatigue Impact Score- MFIS) and mood (Depression, Anxiety and Stress Score- DASS21) questionnaires at baseline, 12 months and 24 months.

MS participants were significantly different in all outcome measures (PASAT, ARCS, DASS and MFIS) compared to HC. The mean PASAT scores slightly increased over 12 and 24 months in the MS cohort, suggestive of a learning effect. The major cognitive domain affected, as measured by the ARCS, was the memory domain (85.46 +/- 20.13 vs 95.63 +/- 11.60, p= 0.008).

However, over the 24 month observation period in this study, the level of impairment was not seen to significantly worsen over time. In this cohort of early diagnosed MS participants, the level of disability and disease duration was higher in natalizumab treated patients, however their level of cognitive impairment and change over time did not differ significantly from those MS participants on other DMT.

A retrospective chart review of MS patients assessed in the Cognitive MS clinic, a part of the London (ON) MS clinic, identified 96 MS patients assessed with the Minimal Assessment of Cognitive Function in Multiple Sclerosis (MACFIMS) battery within one year of a confirmed MS diagnosis, as well as the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Beck Depression Index Fast Screen (BDIFS).</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The average age of this cohort was 36.9 (&#x000b1;11.2) years, 70 (72.9%) were female and 75 (78.1%) identified themselves as Caucasian. The mean years of education was 14 (&#x000b1;2.3). Most of the cohort (81, 84.4%) was diagnosed with relapsing remitting (RR) MS and the median EDSS at the time of diagnosis was 2.0 (range 0-5.0). Only 30 (31.3%) of the cohort were normal on all cognitive tests. Impairment ranged from 1 test (19, 19.8%) to 9 or all (2, 2.1%) tests, representing impairment in 1 domain alone (27, 28.1%) to 6 or all domains (2, 2.1%) included in the MACFIMS battery. The Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT), a measure of processing speed, showed the most impairment (34, 37.5%) while the Controlled Oral Word Association Test (COWAT), a measure of verbal fluency, was least frequently impaired (15, 15.7%). The mean FSS score was 3.9 (&#x000b1;1.8). The mean BDIFS score was 3.7 (&#x000b1;3.5); based on standard classification, 25 (26%) were mild, 14 (14.6%) were moderate and 2 (2.1%) demonstrated severe depression. The mean HADS scores for depression and anxiety were 4.4 (&#x000b1;4.0) and 7.7 (&#x000b1;4.2), respectively. When grouped according to affected and non-affected based on HADS scores, 52 (54.2%) were positive for depression and 23 (24.0%) demonstrated anxiety.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> CI and depression are both common findings in newly diagnosed MS patients.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section325-1352458514546077"><title>P161</title><sec id="section326-1352458514546077"><title>Executive functions evaluation in MS Patients without cognitive impairment: a task switching experimental paradigm</title><p>S Migliore<sup>1</sup>, G Curcio<sup>2</sup>, A Couyoumdjian<sup>3</sup>, A Ghazaryan<sup>4</sup>, <underline>D Landi</underline><sup>5</sup>, F Moffa<sup>4</sup>, MG Palmieri<sup>5</sup>, MM Filippi<sup>4</sup>, F Vernieri<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Universit&#x000e0; &#x02018;Campus Bio-Medico&#x02019;, Rome, Italy, <sup>2</sup>Universit&#x000e0; di L&#x02019;Aquila, L&#x02019;Aquila, Italy, <sup>3</sup>Universit&#x000e0; &#x02018;La Sapienza&#x02019;, Rome, Italy, <sup>4</sup>Ospedale Fatebenefratelli, Isola Tiberina, Rome, Italy, <sup>5</sup>Universit&#x000e0; &#x02018;Tor Vergata&#x02019;, Rome, Italy</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Impaired executive functioning can be present since early stages of Multiple Sclerosis (MS); this pattern was correlated with changes in fronto-subcortical fiber tracts (Roca et al., 2008). A specific method for assessing executive functions is the task-switching paradigm, that examines the processes to shift between one task to another; the subjects complete a set of task, engaging interleaving operations that must be performed in an alternating or repeating sequence (Monsell, 2003). Task-switches are usually slower than task repetitions, giving way to the &#x02018;switch cost&#x02019;. Such a task is very challenging and allows to assess both speed and accuracy of performance, providing a complete scenario of executive abilities.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> Given the small number studies available concerning the primary impairment of executive functions in the early stages of MS, the aim of this study is to explore the executive functions in MS patients without cognitive impairment compared to healthy controls (HC) by means of a task-switching paradigm.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Twenty-four patients with diagnosis of MS (Polman et al., 2005) [20 Relapsing-Remitting (RR); 2 Clinically Isolated Syndrome (CIS) and 2 Primary Progressive (PP)] and 25 HC (paired for age, sex and education) were enrolled. Participants were asked to complete two different tasks in rapid and random succession, so that the task may change from one trial to the subsequent (switch trial), or may be repeated (repetition trial). A full neuropsychological battery, including working memory, information processing speed, verbal memory and learning, visuo-spatial memory and executive functions, was administered to exclude subjects with cognitive impairment.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> A significant difference between MS patients and HC was found: analyses on switch and repetition trials showed that the MS patients performed significantly worse just in switch trials (p=0,04). Moreover, a significant increase in Reaction Times (RT) in MS groups to shift between one task to the other was observed. No differences were observed in RT related to the disengagement from the previously executed task.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> This study suggests a primary engagement of executive functions in MS patients without cognitive impairment, mainly depending by the functional integrity of the prefrontal cortex. Detecting early executive dysfunctions with specific cognitive testing could be useful for a prompt enrolment of MS patients into adequate rehabilitation protocols.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section327-1352458514546077"><title>P162</title><sec id="section328-1352458514546077"><title>Cognitive impairment in patients with neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder: a preliminary report</title><p>S-H Kim<sup>1</sup>, J-W Hyun<sup>1</sup>, I-H Jeong<sup>1</sup>, A Joung<sup>1</sup>, H-J Jo<sup>1</sup>, E-S Yu<sup>2</sup>, W Kim<sup>3</sup>, <underline>HJ Kim</underline><sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Research Institute and Hospital of National Cancer Center, Neurology, Go-Yang, Korea, Republic of, <sup>2</sup>Research Institute and Hospital of National Cancer Center, Mental Health Clinic, Go-Yang, Korea, Republic of, <sup>3</sup>The Catholic University of Korea, Neurology, Seoul, Korea, Republic of</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> A few studies have recently reported that about half of patients with neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) have cognitive impairment. However, the patterns of cognitive impairment differ among studies. There is relatively limited research on cognitive impairment in patients with NMOSD.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To investigate the prevalence and pattern of cognitive impairment in patients with NMOSD.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> At least 100 patients with NMOSD and 50 healthy controls (HCs) are planned to be enrolled in this study. So far, 33 patients with NMOSD and 26 HCs have been tested. In all subjects, cognitive function was measured using the following tests from the Brief Repeatable Battery of Neuropsychological Tests: the Auditory Verbal Learning Test (AVLT), Rey Complex Figure Test (RCFT), Controlled Oral Word Association Test (COWAT), and Paced Auditory Addition Test (PASAT). The Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT), digit span test, Stroop test, and Patient Health Questionaire-9 (PHQ-9), a tool for specific to depression were also performed. In each cognitive domain, a score below the fifth percentile of the normative value was considered abnormal, and patients with impaired performance on at least three of 13 tests were considered cognitively impaired. Logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate the association between patient variables and cognitive impairment.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The mean disease duration of NMOSD was 9.2 years, and the median Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score was 3.0. There were no significant differences in age, sex ratio, or education level between the NMOSD and HC groups. Seven (23%) patients with NMOSD were impaired in three domains, and five (16%) patients were impaired in at least four domains. Impairment in patients with NMOSD was most commonly observed in the SDMT (33%), followed by RCFT-delayed recall (36%) and AVLT-immediate recall (24%). No association was found between cognitive impairment and physical disability, illness duration, or the presence of typical brain lesions of NMOSD. The NMOSD group had higher PHQ-9 scores than did the HC group, but depression was not correlated with performance on any cognitive test.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our preliminary analysis showed that about 40% of patients with NMOSD had cognitive impairment. Visuospatial memory, verbal memory, and speed of information processing were commonly impaired, whereas verbal fluency, attention, and executive function were relatively spared.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section329-1352458514546077"><title>P163</title><sec id="section330-1352458514546077"><title>Utilization of the Brief International Cognitive Assessment for Multiple Sclerosis during treatment of relapses in patients with multiple sclerosis</title><p>O Ozt&#x000fc;rk<sup>1</sup>, B Piri Cinar<sup>2</sup>, <underline>S Ozakbas</underline><sup>3</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Dokuz Eylul University, Izmir, Turkey, <sup>2</sup>Giresun State Hospital, Giresun, Turkey, <sup>3</sup>Dokuz Eylul University, Dept. of Neurology, Izmir, Turkey</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> As would be expected a substantial number of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients are compromised neuropsychologically.

We aimed to determine the availability and usefulness of BICAMS in the attack period.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Forthy-nine (30 female) MS patients in an attack period were included in this study. Mean age was 36,41 &#x000b1;8,36. All patients received 1000-mg intravenous MP for 5 days, followed by tappering dose of oral prednisolone for 20 days. BICAMS battery, which includes Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT), California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT2) and the revised Brief Visuospatial Memory Test (BVMTR), EDSS, MUSIQoL, Multiple Sclerosis Neuropsychology Questionnaire patents form (MSNQ-P) and Fatigue Impact Scale (FIS) were administered. Assessment other than MUSIQoL was performed before pulse MP therapy, on day 6, and on day 30. MUSIQOL was not performed on day 6.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Mean CVLT2 score was significantly improved on day 6 (p=0.000) and on day 30 (p=0.000). There was no difference between day 6 and day 30 (p=0.517). Mean SDMT score was also improved both on day 6 (p=0.003) and day 30 (p=0.000). M BVMTR score was improved on day 6 (p=0.000) and on day 30 (p=0.000). There was a strong correlation between CVLT2 and SDMT (r=0.551). Correlations between CVLT2 and BVMTR (r=0,624), and BVMTR and SDMT (r=0,494) were also found strong. On day 30 strong correlations were continuing.

While in a 3T MRI scanner, the alpha-span task was administered. This task is a letter span task that systematically manipulates span-size (3 or 5 letter array) with the added component of simultaneously presenting a secondary processing task whereby the participant has to verify the serial or alphabetized order of the target array (e.g. &#x0201c;G-3?&#x0201d; interpreted as: &#x0201c;Was G the third letter in the array?&#x0201d;). Executive control was operationalized as the difference between alphabetize and serial conditions. Reaction time and percent accuracy were measured.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Patients and controls did not differ in terms of age, sex, or performance on standardized cognitive measures. On the alpha-span task, results revealed main effects of span-size [F(1,81)=12.67, <italic>p</italic>=0.001] and executive demand [F(1,81)=5.83, <italic>p</italic>=0.018), with slower reaction times with increased span-size and executive demand (alphabetize condition). There was no significant interaction between group x span-size or group x executive demand, indicating that the effects of condition were equal across both the control and patient groups. Post hoc analyses revealed that patients and controls did not differ in terms of reaction time or accuracy, with the exception of the &#x02018;Serial 3&#x02019; span in which controls were faster than patients [F(1, 39)=4.69, <italic>p</italic>=0.037].</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Both patients and controls show slower reaction times when the executive demands of a WM task are increased.

VIGIL and ATAVT are computer assisted tests. We also performed a simple PC based reaction task (RT).</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Of the 92 patients, 60% had fatigue (FSMC &#x02265; 53), 35% had cognitive deficits (MUSIC &#x0003c; 19) and 29% had both. According to European regulations, the ATAVT, RT and VIGIL are passed when the individual is above the 16<sup>th</sup> percentile related to a norm sample. 26% of the patients failed the RT, 22% failed the ATAVT and 34% failed the VIGIL. The Student&#x02019;s t-test reveals that patients with Fatigue performed worse in the RT (t(90) = 3,29, p &#x0003c; .01) and VIGIL (t(86) = 2,61, p &#x0003c; .05) compared to patients without Fatigue.

One of the weaknesses in implementing the SDMT in clinical settings is the reliance on published normative data, varying in size and quality, and poor generalizability. Recently an alternative approach has been proposed using regression-based norms, that enables controlling for the effect of demographic variables on test performance. Using that approach higher rates of impairment for SDMT could be identified in previous studies. We endeavoured to investigate the applicability of regression-based SDMT norms in a Dutch MS sample.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To establish regression-based norms that account for demographic effects on test performance for SDMT in Dutch MS patients, and to compare impairment identification rates with original normative data.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> We calculated regression-based norms for the SDMT by using the performance of 95 healthy volunteers (HV), controlling for multiple demographic variables (age, age<sup>2</sup>, gender and education). The regression-based normative equations were applied to the performance of 157 MS patients and used to compute predicted SDMT scores, and in turn to generate Z- and T scores based on the raw performance. Original and regression-based normative data for the SDMT were compared in terms of impairment classification rates, using Z-scores derived from each norming method.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> MS patients were younger than controls, however demographically matched on all other variables. A final regression model included only age as predictor variable, since regression analyses revealed that this was the only demographic characteristic significantly influencing SDMT performance. Regression-based norms for SDMT, more readily detected impairment on the domain of information processing speed in MS patients than existing normative based norms (28 versus 15; p &#x0003c; 0.001). This resulted in two more patients (18 versus 16) being ascribed as cognitively impaired on the extended neuropsychological test battery.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> These results indicate that using regression-based norms for the SDMT, identifies higher rates of impairment on information processing speed in Dutch MS patients.

In addition, MRI measures of T2 and T1 lesion volume (LV), brain parenchymal fraction (BPF), and relative corpus callosum volume (r-CC) (estimated as a ratio of corpus callosum volume to the whole brain volume) were performed. Uni- and multi-variate linear regression models adjusted for age at onset, gender, education, depression, disease duration and potential practice effect were used to calculate association between MRI measures and cognitive performance.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The mean age of patients was 37.6 (&#x000b1;9.1) years, mean and median of disease duration were 10.2 and 7.1 years respectively and 262 (71%) of patients were women.

Furthermore, the CL group showed a significant thinner cortex than the nCL as well as the HC group. No significant differences were observed between the two patient groups with regard to EDSS score, disease duration or age at disease onset.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Here we suggest that cortical lesions play a crucial role in the memory performance of RRMS patients. In contrast, the presence or absence of cortical lesions seems unrelated to basic clinical variables such as disease duration or EDSS score.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section343-1352458514546077"><title>P170</title><sec id="section344-1352458514546077"><title>Cognitive performance at early stages of MS in a Portuguese sample: influence of depressive symptoms, cognitive fatigue and disease characteristics</title><p><underline>MR Neves</underline><sup>1</sup>, C Sousa<sup>2</sup>, AM Passos<sup>1</sup>, A Ferreira<sup>1</sup>, MJ S&#x000e1;<sup>2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Instituto Universit&#x000e1;rio de Lisboa (ISCTE-IUL), Lisboa, Portugal, <sup>2</sup>Hospital S.

Depression and fatigue are common symptoms in MS and primary determinants to impaired quality of life of these patients. No association has been found between reports of fatigue and CI but depressive symptoms are thought to interfere largely with cognitive activities.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> (1) To compare the cognitive performance (CP) of MS patients and healthy subjects; (2) To analyze the influence of clinical factors as fatigue, depressive symptomatology, age of diagnosis and EDSS on the CP of MS patients.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> A total of 109 healthy subjects and 63 MS patients were examined with <italic>Brief Repeatable Battery of Neuropsychological Tests</italic> (BRBN-T), <italic>Beck Depression Inventory, Brief Symptom Inventory</italic> and the subscale of Fatigue/Thinking of <italic>Hamburg Quality of Life Questionnaire in Multiple Sclerosis</italic>.

Contrary to previous studies, Berrigan, LeFevre, Rees, Berard, Freedman, and Walker (2013) did not find the typical pattern of mean RT differences on the CTIP between patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) and matched controls, potentially due to the MS group&#x02019;s early-phase relapsing-remitting diagnosis.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> In the present study, we explored whether Berrigan et al.&#x02019;s (2013) MS sample would show subtle differences in the distribution of RTs on the CTIP tasks, despite the lack of mean RT differences. Indeed, previous research has shown that individuals with MS respond more variably in RT tasks than controls. Using a methodology novel to the field, we reanalyzed the RT data using an ex-Gaussian approach that decomposed the RT distribution into estimates of the location of the leading edge (mu), variability in the leading edge (sigma), and the size of the distribution&#x02019;s tail (tau). We hypothesized that the MS group would have a larger value for the two parameters related to variance (sigma and tau) than matched controls.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> 70 early-phase relapsing-remitting MS patients and 70 healthy matched controls completed the CTIP twice as part of a test battery. The ex-Gaussian was fit to each participant&#x02019;s RTs separately for the three CTIP tasks.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The MS and control groups did not differ in mu. In contrast, the difference in tau approached significance (<italic>p</italic> = .08, &#x003b7;<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = .02). For the semantic search RT task, the difference in sigma approached significance (<italic>p</italic> = .08, &#x003b7;<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = .02) and there was significantly more variability in the overall RT distribution (<italic>p</italic> = .05, &#x003b7;<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = .03).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The ex-Gaussian analysis showed that patients with early-phase relapsing-remitting MS differed from controls in subtle aspects of RT distribution on the CTIP tasks, despite the lack of mean RT differences. The MS group tended to have a greater build-up of slower responses in the RT distribution&#x02019;s tail on all CTIP tasks. The MS group also tended to have more variability in the leading edge and in the overall RT distribution for the semantic search RT task. Using this methodology, future research should examine RT distribution differences for subtypes of MS that are more cognitively affected to develop an understanding of exactly what aspects of RT distribution vary across a wide range of groups.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section347-1352458514546077"><title>P172</title><sec id="section348-1352458514546077"><title>Predictivity of executive functions deficit on episodic memory disorder in multiple sclerosis</title><p>R Barthelemy<sup>1,2</sup>, <underline>B Lenne</underline><sup>1,3</sup>, D Leuse<sup>1</sup>, H Mecheri<sup>3</sup>, A Kwiatkowski<sup>1,4</sup>, P Hautecoeur<sup>1,4</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>H&#x000f4;pital Saint Vincent de Paul, Neurology, Lille, France, <sup>2</sup>Centre d&#x02019;&#x000c9;tudes et de Recherche sur la SEP, Lille, France, <sup>3</sup>Universite Catholique de Lille, Facult&#x000e9; de Lettres et de Sciences Humaines, Lille, France, <sup>4</sup>Universite Catholique de Lille, Facult&#x000e9; de Medecine, Lille, France</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Cognitive impairment in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is one of the main factors of disability and poor quality of life. Several cognitive functions could be damaged, such as information processing speed (IPS), attention or executive functioning (EF); but alteration of memory is the most observed and reported by patients. However, a memory deficit could reflect the presence of another cognitive deficit and vice versa.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To determinate the influence of the other cognitive functions on episodic memory disorder in MS.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> 411 patients (244 RRMS; 126 SPMS; 41 PPMS) were assessed by an extensive neuropsychological battery (BCcogSEP, Dujardin et al., 2004, a French adaptation of the BRB-N, Rao et al. 1991) including 8 tests assessing 7 cognitive functions. A step wise multivariate regression analysis has been applied to determinate which cognitive functions were the most predictive of the episodic memory deficit, according to the phenotype.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> 62% patients were identified as cognitively impaired by the multidimensional neuropsychological battery (getting 4 or more pathological scores). Considering all phenotypes, the episodic memory performance (mean retrieval and learning index) was predicted by working memory (WM) and IPS (PASAT; p&#x0003c; 0.0001, Symbol Digit Modalities Test; p&#x0003c; 0.0001), inhibition ability (Go/No Go Task; p&#x0003c; 0.0001) and verbal initiation (verbal fluency; p&#x0003c; 0.0001). Episodic memory seems more influenced by IPS in RRMS patients, IPS and EF in SPMS and WM in PPMS.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Processes involved in an episodic memory task (encoding, stocking, retrieval) require an implication of executive functions, as well as a timed test requires an IPS. In our study, IPS and EF appeared to be the ones predicting the most the episodic memory performance, whatever were the processes. This study emphasizes the differential implication of IPS and WM on learning abilities according to disease courses, which directs further cognitive rehabilitation procedures aiming an improvement of learning abilities</p></sec></sec><sec id="section349-1352458514546077"><title>P173</title><sec id="section350-1352458514546077"><title>The relationship between SDMT and everyday life performance: actual reality</title><p><underline>Y Goverover</underline><sup>1</sup>, CD Nancy<sup>2</sup>, J DeLuca<sup>2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>New York University, New York, NY, United States, <sup>2</sup>Kessler Foundation, West Orange, NJ, United States</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> To date, most studies of the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) examine its utility as a brief screening test that may identify patients with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) who would benefit from a more thorough cognitive assessment or treatment.

Participants performed the SDMT and the AR tasks. For the AR task, participants were asked to use a computer to purchase airline tickets or cookies via the internet. Task performance was scored based on whether participants accurately performed the steps to complete the task, the type of cues needed to complete each step of the task and time to task completion. Lower scores indicated greater independence in task performance.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> SDMT scores were significantly associated with AR performance. Thus, slowed information processing speed (SDMT) was significantly associated with worse performance on the AR.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The everyday functional independence of individuals with MS is dependent on the ability to efficiently use everyday resources to perform everyday tasks. Everyday functioning is associated with SDMT performance. Thus, the SDMT can provide a meaningful data related to functional status of an individual with MS.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="section351-1352458514546077"><title>Comorbidities and risk behaviors</title><sec id="section352-1352458514546077"><title>P174</title><sec id="section353-1352458514546077"><title>Does smoking influence MRI disease activity in multiple sclerosis?</title><p>SAS Kvistad<sup>1</sup>, K-M Myhr<sup>1</sup>, T Holm&#x000f8;y<sup>2</sup>, S Bakke<sup>3</sup>, A Beiske<sup>4</sup>, K Bjerve<sup>5</sup>, H Hovdal<sup>6</sup>, KI L&#x000f8;ken-Amsrud<sup>7</sup>, F Lille&#x000e5;s<sup>8</sup>, R Midgard<sup>9</sup>, T Pedersen<sup>10</sup>, J &#x00160;altyt&#x00117; Benth<sup>11</sup>, S Wergeland<sup>12</sup>, <underline>&#x000d8; Torkildsen</underline><sup>12</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Haukeland University Hospital, Neurology, Bergen, Norway, <sup>2</sup>Akershus University Hospital, Neurology, Oslo, Norway, <sup>3</sup>Oslo University Hospital, Department of Neuroradiology, Oslo, Norway, <sup>4</sup>Multiple Sclerosis Centre, Hakadal, Norway, <sup>5</sup>St. Olavs Hospital, Department of Medical Biochemistry, Trondheim, Norway, <sup>6</sup>St.Olav University Hospital, Neurology, Trondheim, Norway, <sup>7</sup>Innlandet Hospital Trust, Department of Neurology, Lillehammer, Norway, <sup>8</sup>Curato, Oslo, Norway, <sup>9</sup>Department of Neurology, Molde, Norway, <sup>10</sup>Unilabs, Drammen, Norway, <sup>11</sup>University of Oslo, Institute of Clinical Medicine, Oslo, Norway, <sup>12</sup>Haukeland University Hospital, Department of Neurology, Bergen, Norway</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Smoking is a risk factor for MS and previous studies have reported that smoking affect disease progression.

Serum levels of cotinine, a nicotine metabolite that is widely used as a biomarker for recent tobacco use, were analyzed using an immunoassay. Patients were divided into three groups according to mean cotinine level, -levels &#x0003c; 10 for non-smokers, 10-300 for active smokers and levels &#x0003e;300 for heavy smokers. We analyzed serum samples from patients at baseline and month 6, 12, 18 and 24. MRI assessments were made at baseline, months 6, 12 and 24 and included the count of T1 gadolinium enhancing (T1Gd+) lesions, T2 lesions and combined unique activity (CUA; the sum of T1Gd+ lesions and new or enlarging T2 lesions). Associations between cotinine level and MRI activity were assessed by a logistic regression model.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> 29 patients had cotinine levels &#x0003c; 10, 9 patients had cotinine levels between 10- 300 and 42 patients had cotinine levels &#x0003e;300. There was no significant association between cotinine levels and MRI activity. For patients with cotinine levels &#x0003e;300 the odds ratio for new T1Gd + lesions were 0.81 (95% CI 0.43-1.55; p=0.526), for new T2 lesions 0.86 (95% CI 0.42-1.75; p=0.672) and for CUA 0.92 (95% CI 0.46-1.84; p=0.816) compared to the non-smokers. Cotinine levels were not associated with clinical disease activity assessed by relapse-rate or EDSS score. The results were not influenced by interferon-beta treatment. Adjustments for gender, age, HLA-DRB1*15 status, body mass index, vitamin D-levels, vitamin A-levels or ENBA-1 IgG titers did not affect the results.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> We did not find any association between smoking and MRI- or clinical disease activity. To our knowledge no other study has addressed this issue. Our results indicate that smoking does not directly influence MRI activity or relapse-rate and thus probably increases the risk for disease development and progression through other mechanisms.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section354-1352458514546077"><title>P175</title><sec id="section355-1352458514546077"><title>Smoking and HLA genes impact on disease activity and severity before and during treatment with interferon-beta</title><p><underline>ER Petersen</underline><sup>1</sup>, HB Soendergaard<sup>1</sup>, JH Lauersen<sup>1</sup>, N Koch-Henriksen<sup>2,3</sup>, M Magyari<sup>1,3</sup>, PS S&#x000f8;rensen<sup>1</sup>, F Sellebjerg<sup>1</sup>, AB Oturai<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Copenhagen University Hospital, Rigshospitalet, Department of Neurology, Danish Multiple Sclerosis Center, Copenhagen, Denmark, <sup>2</sup>University of Aarhus, Department of Neuroepidemiology, Aarhus, Denmark, <sup>3</sup>Copenhagen University Hospital, Rigshospitalet, The Danish Multiple Sclerosis Registry, The Danish MS Research Center, Copenhagen, Denmark</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Smoking increases the risk of MS and disease progression.

Clinical data from two years before start of IFN-beta therapy to either treatment stop or to the last follow-up examination was obtained from the Danish MS Treatment Register.

Subjects were categorized based on adolescent body mass index (BMI) and past IM and compared with regard to occurrence of MS, by calculating odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) employing logistic regression. A potential interaction between adolescent BMI and past IM was evaluated by calculating the attributable proportion due to interaction.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Regardless of HLA status, a substantial interaction was observed between adolescent obesity and past IM with regard to MS risk.

In the incident study, the OR of MS was 14.7 (95% CI 5.9-36.6) among subjects with adolescent obesity and past IM after the age of 10, compared to subjects with none of these exposures. The corresponding OR in the prevalent study was 13.2 (95% CI 5.2-33.6).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> An obese state both impacts the cellular immune response to infections and induces a state of chronic immune-mediated inflammation which may contribute to explain our finding of an interaction between adolescent BMI and past IM.

This poses a clinical challenge in patients with both MS and IBD especially with failure of other IBD directed treatments.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To study whether anti-TNF&#x003b1; therapy increases the risk of MS in patients with IBD.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> We retrospectively identified 10712 adult patients referred for IBD evaluation to the Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN from a five state capture area (Minnesota, Wisconsin, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Iowa) between 1996 and 2010. In two randomly sampled subsets (n=200), average non-diagnosis frequency for IBD was 14.3% with a predicted confirmed diagnosis of IBD in 9181 patients (n=3750 with anti-TNF&#x003b1;, n=5431 without anti-TNF&#x003b1;). In patients with additional IIDD diagnoses, this was confirmed by clinical, laboratory and imaging reviews. Risk of IIDD in patients with and without anti-TNF&#x003b1; exposure was estimated for IBD, Crohn&#x02019;s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) groups separately (Wilcoxon rank sum and Fischer exact tests as appropriate).</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The frequency of IIDDs in patients with and without anti-TNF&#x003b1; was; IBD: 0.15% and 0.18% (RR=0.83, 95%CI:0.28-2.42; p=0.729); CD: 0.19% and 0.22% (RR=0.89, 95%CI:0.24-3.31; p=0.863); UC: 0.07% and 0.15% (RR=0.49, 95%CI:0.06-4.22; p=0.510). Following IBD diagnosis (median follow-up: 10.5 years; IQR:17.4) and anti-TNF&#x003b1; initiation (median follow-up: 0.8 years; IQR:6.1), the number needed to treat to harm one patient was 3333 (4202 for CD; 1335 for UC patients). IIDDs were confirmed in 34 patients (19 before and 15 after IBD onset). Except for 2 patients with nonspecific demyelinating disease, 32/34 had definite MS (9/32 PPMS). Of the 15 patients with IIDD (14 MS) onset after IBD (5 with anti-TNF&#x003b1;, 10 without anti-TNF&#x003b1;), median age at diagnosis of IBD was 30.4 (IQR:17.1) years. Median age at first neurological symptom was 35.0 (IQR:18.3) years. Anti-TNF&#x003b1; exposure always happened before MS onset.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Anti-TNF&#x003b1; agents do not seem to impact the risk of developing clinical MS in patients with IBD. In the absence of anti-TNF&#x003b1; therapy, risk of coexistence of MS and IBD (0.3%) is comparable to the population-based prevalence of MS from the same region in 2000 (0.2%).</p></sec></sec><sec id="section360-1352458514546077"><title>P178</title><sec id="section361-1352458514546077"><title>Prescription drug use among patients with multiple sclerosis</title><p><underline>LW Svenson</underline><sup>1,2,3</sup>, DP Schopflocher<sup>1,3,4</sup>, SA Warren<sup>5</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>University of Alberta, School of Public Health, Edmonton, AB, Canada, <sup>2</sup>Alberta Ministry of Health, Surveillance and Assessment, Edmonton, AB, Canada, <sup>3</sup>University of Calgary, Community Health Sciences, Calgary, AB, Canada, <sup>4</sup>University of Alberta, Faculty of Nursing, Edmonton, AB, Canada, <sup>5</sup>University of Alberta, Faculty of Rehabiliation Medicine, Edmonton, AB, Canada</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> While much is known about the use of disease modifying therapies for MS, there is little information on the general use of prescription medication.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> The objective of this study was to quantify the use of prescription drugs among people with MS through the linkage of population-based administrative health data.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> The province of Alberta maintains a publicly funded, universally available health care system. As part of this system, a population registry is maintained containing key demographics and a unique lifetime identifier. Data on physician visits, hospitalizations and emergency department visits are maintained by the Ministry of Health. All individuals receiving one or more services for MS (ICD-9 340 or ICD-10 G35) were extracted from these databases for the period 1985 to 2013. To reduce the risk of false positive cases, a case was defined as having three or more physician visits or a single hospitalization or a single emergency department visit with MS coded. Prevalent cases in 2012 were then linked to the Alberta Pharmacy Information Network which contains records for all prescription drugs dispensed by community pharmacies.

Combination of physical and psychological factors such as pain, spasms, nocturia, depression, anxiety or medication effects could contribute to sleep disruption. The more common sleep disorders include insomnia, sleepness, sleep apnea, restless legs syndrome (RLS) or narcolepsy. Frequently, these disturbances have a major impact on health and quality of life (QoL) of patients to be associated with increased risk of mortality, obesity, cardiac disease or increased fatigue and depression.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> Estimate the prevalence of sleep disorders in patients seen in the DD consultation and the relationship of sleep disorder and QoL and fatigue.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> 240 patients were included; mean age 43&#x000b1;11 years, 187 women. 163 patients with multiple sclerosis (MS): 144 relapsing-remitting (RR), 14 secondary progressive (SP) and 5 primary progressive (PP). 36 clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), 26 Radiological isolated syndrome (RIS) and 15 patients with others DD.

Subjects were asked to recall their weight (in lbs) at the time of first menstruation and at age 25. BMI was calculated accordingly for age 25 but not extended to time of first menstruation, since height measures in adolescence could not reliably be deduced. Regression analyses were carried out to investigate the association between weight or BMI as a continuous measure, and age at MS onset.

It has recently been reported that alcohol consumption exhibits a dose-dependent inverse association with MS risk.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> We aimed to determine if individuals with alcohol-use disorders, who may be presumed to consume large quantities of alcohol, have an altered MS risk compared to the general population.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> A record-linkage study was conducted using linked datasets of English Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) (records of every episode of hospital admission and day case care in all English National Health Service hospitals) and death registrations for England from January 1999 to December 2011. Three cohorts of people with a record for alcohol use (10156 people), alcohol abuse (255827 people) and alcohol dependence (281305 people) were constructed by identifying the first recorded episode in which either condition was a diagnosis. A reference cohort was constructed of people admitted for various other minor medical and surgical conditions (6.7 million people). We then searched for any subsequent hospital care for, or death from, MS in these cohorts. The rate ratio was then calculated.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> There was a significantly increased risk of MS following alcohol use (p=0.003), alcohol abuse (p&#x0003c; 0.0001) and alcohol dependence (p=0.001). Considering the possibility of reverse causality we found an elevated risk of MS within one year of first admission for alcohol abuse only (p&#x0003c; 0.0001), but not for alcohol use or dependence (p=0.81 and p=0.25 respectively). Further, there was a significantly elevated risk of MS following alcohol use, abuse and dependence (p&#x0003c; 0.0001, p=0.003 and p=0.003 respectively) with a time interval of more than one year from first admission with the alcohol-use disorder. The association between alcohol-use disorders and risk of MS was more evident in males than females.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> This study supports the presence of a significant positive association between alcohol-use disorders and MS risk, particularly in men. The strengths of this study are the prospective design and the enormous size of the HES database. The likely much higher levels of toxicity and alcohol dependency in our study may be associated with MS. Clinical advise with regard to alcohol consumption and MS remains largely speculative, and long-term follow-up studies are required to ascertain the relationship.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section370-1352458514546077"><title>P183</title><sec id="section371-1352458514546077"><title>The metabolic syndrome in disabled multiple sclerosis patients: prevalence and characteristics</title><p><underline>M Livne</underline><sup>1,2</sup>, O Pinhas-Hamiel<sup>2,3</sup>, G Harari<sup>4</sup>, A Achiron<sup>1,2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Sheba Medical Center, Multiple Sclerosis Center, Ramat Gan, Israel, <sup>2</sup>Sackler School of Medicine, Tel-Aviv, Israel, <sup>3</sup>Sheba Medical Center, Pediatric Endocrinology, Ramat Gan, Israel, <sup>4</sup>Medistat, Tel-Aviv, Israel</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Scarce information is available about the association of metabolic commodities and disability in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS).</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To examine the prevalence of the metabolic syndrome (MetS) and characterize its components in MS patients with significant disability.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> The study enrolled MS patients suffering from significant disability with Extended Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score between 3.0 and 7.5. Medical history was obtained by an interview and data included demographic and clinical variables, weight, height, waist circumference (WC), blood pressure, fasting glucose, triglycerides, and HDL-C levels. BMI was calculated as weight (kg) divided by square of height (m<sup>2</sup>), and WC was measured with a soft tape on standing patients midway between the lowest rib and the iliac crest. MetS was defined according to the US National Cholesterol Education Program: Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP/ATP III) criteria as the presence of any three of the following five components 1) central obesity as measured by WC (males &#x0003e;102 cm, females &#x0003e;88 cm), 2) triglycerides (TG) <underline>&#x0003e;</underline>150 mg/dl, 3) HDL-C &#x0003c; 40 mg/dl for males and &#x0003c; 50 mg/dl for females, or treated dyslipidemia 4) blood pressure &#x0003e;135/85 or treated hypertension, and 5) fasting glucose <underline>&#x0003e;</underline>100 mg/dl or known type 2 diabetes.

Odds ratios (ORs) for Charlson comorbidity index and pre-specified comorbidities before MS diagnosis and hazard ratios (HRs) for development of incident comorbidities and all-cause mortality following diagnosis of MS were estimated.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The association between MS and Charlson comorbidity index prior to diagnosis was dose-dependent with adjusted ORs (95% confidence intervals [CIs]) of 1.22 (1.09&#x02013;1.36) and 1.86 (1.39&#x02013;2.48) for the score categories of 1-2 and &#x02265;3 (p<sub>trend</sub> &#x0003c; 0.001), respectively. Most patients (87.26%) had diagnosis of neurological diseases other than MS prior to diagnosis. MS was associated with ORs (95% CI) of 17.19 (9.77-30.23) for hemiplegia and 2.24 (1.61-3.12) for cerebrovascular diseases. Cardiac arrhythmias, peripheral vascular disease, depression and anaemia were also more common in people with incident MS in the adjusted model. Cumulative probabilities of having a Charlson comorbidity index &#x02265; 1 at diagnosis and 5 year after diagnosis were 21.99% and 30.30% for MS patients and 17.32% and 25.21% for controls. MS was also associated with an adjusted HR (95% CI) of 1.08 (1.01&#x02013;1.16) for having a Charlson comorbidity index &#x02265; 1. After adjusting for age, sex, index year, BMI class, smoking status, alcohol consumption and Charlson comorbidity index at diagnosis, MS was associated with a hazard ratio (95% CI) for all-cause mortality of 1.73 (1.50-2.00).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The majority of MS patients already have neurological diagnosis prior to the initial diagnosis.

Furthermore, we collected blood samples from 100 smoking and non-smoking HC. CRP and cytokines were measured in serum, and freshly isolated PBMCs were CFSE stained and cultured with myelin basic protein (MBP), myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG), EBV cell lysate, uninfected cell lysate or without antigen. Flow cytometric analysis was performed at day 7, after staining the PBMCs with flourochrome conjugated antibodies.

All participants underwent a structured interview to assess smoking history: current smoking status, age of starting and quitting, and average number of cigarettes smoked per day. Patients were classified according to their current smoking status as non-smokers, current-smokers, past-smokers and second hand-smokers. Regarding the smoking status at disease onset they were classified as regular and non-smokers. Clinical and demographic data of all participants was obtained and MusiQol questionnaire was used to assess quality of life.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The sample consisted of 73,3% female patients, with a mean age 44,05 (&#x000b1;12,56) years, mean disease duration 12.27 (&#x000b1; 10.35) years, 87,5% with a Relapsing-Remitting MS (RRMS) and 12,5% a Secondary-Progressive MS (SPMS). Considering the current smoking status, 18,3% patients were current-smokers, 47,5% non-smokers, 22,5% past-smokers and 11,7% second hand-smokers. Regarding the smoking status at MS onset, 26,7% were regular-smokers.

Baseline demographics: 83% Relapsing Remitting MS, 82% Caucasian, 10% African American, 65% married, 77% female and 31% were between the ages of 36-45. A total of 29 patients (12%) were identified to have current substance abuse, 208 (88%) did not currently abuse substances and 18 were excluded due to missing data. Additionally, 87% utilized some substance in their lifetime of which 48% used a substance other than tobacco or alcohol. Employment status was found to be a significant predictor of current substance abuse. For unemployed patients with MS, the odds of current substance abuse was 4.67 times that of an employed patient with MS (95% CI: 1.99-10.97; p=0.002).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Substance abuse is present in the MS patient population. Unemployment significantly increased the risk of current substance abuse. Race, age, sex, MS disease course, disability and marital status were not significant predictors of substance abuse. Larger studies are needed to confirm the results obtained from this study. Since substance abuse may adversely affect MS patient health and ability to remain adherent to MS disease modifying therapy, screening for substance abuse should be considered by MS specialists, especially among patients who are unemployed.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section380-1352458514546077"><title>P188</title><sec id="section381-1352458514546077"><title>Elevated adiponectin levels induce pro-inflammatory responses in both myeloid cells and T-cells: linking adiposity and predisposition to pediatric MS</title><p><underline>M Nyirenda</underline><sup>1</sup>, L Poliquin-Lasnier<sup>1</sup>, H Hanwell<sup>2</sup>, A Saveriano<sup>1</sup>, A Rozenberg<sup>1</sup>, R Li<sup>1</sup>, CS Moore<sup>1</sup>, C Belabani<sup>3</sup>, T Johnson<sup>3</sup>, J O&#x02019;Mahony<sup>2</sup>, RA Marrie<sup>4</sup>, S Dunn<sup>5</sup>, B Banwell<sup>6</sup>, A Bar-Or<sup>1,3</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Neuroimmunology Unit, Montreal Neurological Institute, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada, <sup>2</sup>Neurosciences and Mental Health, Hospital for Sick Children Research Institute, Toronto, ON, Canada, <sup>3</sup>Experimental Therapeutics Program, Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada, <sup>4</sup>Departments of Internal Medicine and Community Health Sciences, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB, Canada, <sup>5</sup>University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada, <sup>6</sup>Division of Neurology, Children&#x02019;s Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA, United States</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Overweight and obesity in childhood and early adolescence has been associated with an increased risk of MS in both adult and pediatric populations. However, the underlying pathobiology behind this association remains unknown.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To examine whether altered secretion of adipose tissue hormones (adipokines) explain the association between adiposity and MS in a pediatric cohort, wherein we have previously identified an association between higher body mass index (BMI) percentiles and increased likelihood of MS outcome.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Levels of leptin, resistin, visfatin, and ghrelin (luminex) as well as adiponectin (total, and isoforms; ELISA) were blindly quantified in batch, in serum samples obtained from children (&#x0003c; 16 years old) presenting with incident acquired demyelinating syndromes (ADS), as part of the prospective Canadian Pediatric Demyelinating Disease Study. Results from children subsequently diagnosed with MS (ADS-MS; n=40) were compared to results from children remaining with monophasic ADS (ADS-Mono; n=119) or healthy controls (HC; n=29). The impact of adiponectin-containing pediatric MS sera was assessed on activated CD14<sup>+</sup> myeloid cells (expression of CD80, CD83, CD86, TNF&#x003b1; and IL-6) and on CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (expression of IFN&#x003b3; and IL-17), using flow cytometry and ELISA.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Children with ADS-MS exhibited significantly higher levels of serum adiponectin compared to children with ADS-Mono (p = 0.0001) and HC children (p = 0.0002), independent of sex or age at ADS presentation. Elevated levels of low molecular weight (LMW) and medium molecular weight (MMW) adiponectin isoforms accounted for the increased levels of total adiponectin in the children with MS compared to the children with ADS-Mono (LMW; p = 0.0002; MMW: p = 0.0001) and the HC children (LMW; p = 0.0025; MMW: p = 0.0013). Pediatric MS serum induced adiponectin-dependent enhanced expression of CD80, CD83, CD86, IL-6 and TNF&#x003b1; by CD14<sup>+</sup> monocytes, and increased expression of IFN&#x003b3; by both CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. The enhanced T cell pro-inflammatory responses mediated by adiponectin in pediatric MS serum appeared to represent the combination of a direct effect on T cells, and an indirect effect mediated through myeloid cells.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our findings suggest that elevated levels of adiponectin may contribute to an enhanced inflammatory state of both innate and adaptive immune responses involved in early disease mechanisms of childhood-onset MS.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section382-1352458514546077"><title>P189</title><sec id="section383-1352458514546077"><title>Investigating healthy lifestyle behaviors in multiple sclerosis: the role of neurological reserve and implicit processes of understanding</title><p><underline>CE Schwartz</underline><sup>1,2</sup>, A Ayandeh<sup>1,2</sup>, JD Rodgers<sup>3</sup>, P Duberstein<sup>4,5</sup>, B Weinstock-Guttman<sup>3</sup>, RH Benedict<sup>3</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>DeltaQuest Foundation, Concord, MA, United States, <sup>2</sup>Tufts University Medical School, Medicine and Orthopaedic Surgery, Boston, MA, United States, <sup>3</sup>University of Buffalo, Department of Neurology, Buffalo, MA, United States, <sup>4</sup>University of Rochester Medical Center, Psychiatry, Rochester, NY, United States, <sup>5</sup>University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester Health Care Decision Making Group, Rochester, NY, United States</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Neurological reserve may slow disease progression in multiple sclerosis (MS), and is associated with not engaging in destructive health behaviors. Lifestyle behaviors are important in MS, but research on lifestyle has been hampered by an inadequate conceptual frame. To address this problem, we propose viewing lifestyle behaviors from the perspective of neurological reserve theory. We introduce a new concept, implicit processes of understanding, comprised of social understanding, physical disability insight, and somatic awareness.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> We investigated the relationship between active (current) and passive (premorbid) neurological reserve, implicit processes of understanding, and healthy lifestyle behaviors.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> This cohort study includes MS clinic patients and their caregiver-informants (n=118 pairs).

Presence of 15 concomitant diseases and 5 aggregate disease categories (presence of one concomitant, multiple concomitant, Th1-mediated, Th2-mediated, and non-Th mediated diseases) were tested against the general non-concomitant disease MS population with respect to MRI characteristics. Analyses were performed on each disease and category. The Th1 mediated disease included: systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn&#x02019;s disease, diabetes mellitus type 1, manic depressive illness, psoriasis, allergies, thyroiditis and myasthenia gravis. The Th2 mediated diseases included asthma and ulcerative colitis, while non-Th-mediated disease included cancer, diabetes mellitus type 2, epilepsy, irritable bowel syndrome migraine and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The MRI outcomes included lesion, atrophy magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) and diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI) measures. The analyses were corrected for multiple comparisons.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Of the 857 MS patients included in the study, 43.5% had one and 10.5% had multiple concomitant diseases. Of those, 17.2% were Th1 mediated, 5.6% were Th2 mediated and 28.4% were non-Th mediated. The presence of one or more concomitant diseases had a significant effect on CNS repair mechanisms as measured by the decreased whole brain MTR (p&#x0003c; 0.05). Th1-deviation was associated with decreased whole brain MTR (p=0036) and increased DTI damage (p&#x0003c; 0.05), while Th2-deviation was associated with decreased DTI damage (p&#x0003c; 0.05). No association was found with MRI lesion and atrophy outcomes.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The presence of concomitant diseases in MS has an effect on the repair mechanisms which occur within the CNS.

CVID is characterized by a history of recurrent sinopulmonary infections, marked reduction in at least two immunoglobulin isotypes and impaired responses to vaccination. However, despite deficiency in functional antibodies, autoimmune diseases such as cytopenias, autoimmune hepatitis or inflmmatory bowel disease, affect about 20% of CVID patients and are commonly the first clinical manifestation of immune deficiency . To our knowledge, multiple sclerosis (MS) has not been reported as an autoimmune condition associated with CVID.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To describe a case series of patients with clinically definite Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and Common Variable Immunodeficiency Disease (CVID).</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Case series.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The Barnabas MS Comprehensive Care Center (Livingston, NJ), follows approximately 1,100 MS patients. 3 women between the ages of 34-56, with clinically definite relapsing-remitting MS, developed increased frequency of infections coincident with initiation of an immunomodulatory treatment for MS - in 2 cases Natalizumab, and the other Glatiramer Acetate. All 3 patients reported lifelong history of recurrent sinopulmonary infections. All patients underwent immunological evaluation; based on the clinical history, immunoglobulin profile and response to a panel of vaccines, all patients were diagnosed with CVID. Monthly <bold>i</bold>ntravenous immunoglobulin therapy, the treatment of choice for CVID, was initiated in all patients. All patients were able to continue with prescribed immunotherapy for MS.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The incidence of CVID in the general population is estimated to be 1:25,000-1:50,000. Our finding of 3 CVID cases in our 1,100-patient cohort raises the question of an association between the two conditions. A link between CVID and MS is biologically plausible in view of the known predilection of CVID patients to autoimmune diseases, but will require confirmation in a rigorous epidemiologic study. Our case series serves to raise awareness among neurologists that MS patients with unusual or frequent infections, which may be unmasked upon initiation of an immunotherapy, warrant a thorough immunologic evaluation. Increased awareness will likely result in more reports of patients with MS and immunodeficiency and enhance our understanding of the interrelationship between immunodeficiency and autoimmunity.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section388-1352458514546077"><title>P192</title><sec id="section389-1352458514546077"><title>Body mass index in patients with multiple sclerosis: does disability matter?</title><p><underline>O Pinhas-Hamiel</underline><sup>1,2</sup>, M Livne<sup>2,3</sup>, G Harari<sup>4</sup>, A Achiron<sup>2,3</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Sheba Medical Center, Pediatric Endocrinology, Ramat Gan, Israel, <sup>2</sup>Sackler School of Medicine, Tel-Aviv, Israel, <sup>3</sup>Sheba Medical Center, Multiple Sclerosis Center, Ramat Gan, Israel, <sup>4</sup>Medistat, Tel-Aviv, Israel</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> We hypothesized that multiple sclerosis (MS) patients with significant disability will be heavier than the general population secondary to decreased motor function and immobility, recurrent steroid treatments and sedentary life style behavior.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To examine potential interactions between body mass index (BMI) and significant disability in patients with MS.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> The study enrolled 130 patients with MS with Extended Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score between 3.0 and 7.5.

(Patten et al., 2012; Lorefice et al., 2013). Reduced quality of life (QoL) in people with MS has been associated with severe neurologic disability and psychological distress (Wolling et al., 2013).</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> The purpose of this study is to measure in a sample of patients with MS and in a sample of healthy controls, the possible impairment of QoL due to MS and the possible role of psychiatric disorders in amplifying the deterioration of the QoL. A secondary objective is to compare the effect of MS clinical features on QoL (course, disease duration, age at onset, EDSS score, disease modifying drugs) in psychiatric and no psychiatric MS patients.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Cases: 201 consecutive-MS-patients. Controls: 804 sex-and-age-matched subjects without MS, randomly selected from an epidemiological database study. (Carta et al., 2010). Psychiatric diagnoses according to DSM-IV were determined by psychiatrists using a semi-structured clinical interview (ANTAS-SCID) derived in part from the non-patient version (SCID-I/NP) for DSM-IV (First et al., 2002). QoL was evaluated with the Short Form Health Survey (SF-12) (Ware et al., 1996). The SF-12 includes the following dimensions: physical activity, physical health limitations on roles or activities, emotional state, physical pain, self-evaluation of general state of health, vitality, social activity and mental health. The period of QoL measurement was the month prior of SF-12 evaluation. Higher scores on the SF-12 correspond to better conditions and quality of life.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> MS was the strongest determinant in worsening the QoL in the overall sample (p&#x0003c; 0.001). In the total sample as in cases of MS the presence of mood disorders play a role in reducing QoL (p&#x0003c; 0.01). In particular, both depressive and bipolar spectrum disorders were significantly associated with a poorer QoL in MS sample (p&#x0003c; 0.01). Furthermore, in MS group the higher neurologic disability was a strong determinant in reducing QoL, in particular in MS patients without mood disorder (p&#x0003c; 0.0001). No association was found for other clinical MS features.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The study highlights the role of comorbidity of mood disorders in the reduction of QoL in MS. The results suggest that the clinician should pay attention not only to physical symptoms, but also to affective disorders in the management of MS.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section392-1352458514546077"><title>P194</title><sec id="section393-1352458514546077"><title>Subclinical coronary artery disease in multiple sclerosis patients</title><p><underline>E Andreadou</underline><sup>1</sup>, S Gerakoulis<sup>1</sup>, V Haina<sup>1</sup>, S Katsavos<sup>1</sup>, M-E Evangelopoulos<sup>1</sup>, G Koutsis<sup>1</sup>, M Anagnostouli<sup>1</sup>, E Stamboulis<sup>1</sup>, C Kilidireas<sup>1</sup>, E Gialafos<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Athens National and Kapodistrian University, Department of Neurology, &#x02018;Aeginition&#x02019; Hospital, Athens, Greece</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> The incidence and prevalence of ischemic heart disease in the MS population has been reported to be higher than expected in persons aged &#x0003c;60 years. Lower levels of physical activity in MS have been associated with subclinical atherosclerosis. Moreover, myocardial ischemia and arrhythmias with normal coronary arteries have been associated with upper thoracic spinal cord lesions, possibly attributed to coronary vasoconstriction due to intense activation of cardiac sympathetic nerves.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> Aim of this study was the detection of asymptomatic coronary artery disease (CAD) through perfusion test in patients with MS.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> We enrolled 50 consecutive patients aged &#x0003c; 60 years with&#x003bf;out clinical history of CAD that fulfilled the 2005 revised McDonald criteria for definite MS. Patients with history of CAD, use of beta bocker or implanted pacemaker or defibrillator were excluded. Age at disease onset, disease duration, initial symptomatology, disease subtype, medication and EDSS score were recorded. MRI and CSF data were collected. After electrocardiogram, 24-ambulatory ECG recording (Holter) echocardiography and clinical examination as primary screening, pharmacologic stress thallium 201 scintigraphy and/or coronary angiography were performed.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Mean age of the patients was 45.3&#x000b1;7 years mean disease duration was 6&#x000b1;13 years and mean EDSS score was 3.4 &#x000b1; 1.8. Relapsing-remitting MS had 60%, secondary progressive 32% and primary progressive MS 8% of the patients. Thirteen patients ((26%, 9 males) had abnormal scintigraphy test although clinical profile was not suggestive of CAD. Holter didn&#x02019;t reveal arrhythmias and two patients had a critical ejection fraction (around 50%) in this group. All positive patients that underwent coronary angiogram (n=7) had normal coronary arteries implying vasoconstriction as a potential mechanism for the stress positive result. A common finding of all positive patients was the presence of demyelinating lesions in lower cervical (C5-7) and upper thoracic (Th1-4) spinal cord. No differences were observed in disease duration, EDSS and treatment approaches between the two groups.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our study shows a high incidence of coronary artery disease of non-atheroscletic type. This finding might be due to the presence of lesions in upper thoracic spinal cord possibly interfering with ANS function. Our findings might have implications for treatment strategies and help to distinguish patients at higher risk.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="section394-1352458514546077"><title>CSF studies</title><sec id="section395-1352458514546077"><title>P195</title><sec id="section396-1352458514546077"><title>Genetic risk factors are associated with cerebrospinal fluid measures in multiple sclerosis</title><p><underline>A Goris</underline><sup>1</sup>, I Pauwels<sup>1</sup>, MW Gustavsen<sup>2,3</sup>, B Van Son<sup>4</sup>, K Hilven<sup>1</sup>, SD Bos<sup>2,3</sup>, EG Celius<sup>2</sup>, P Berg-Hansen<sup>2</sup>, J Aarseth<sup>5</sup>, K-M Myhr<sup>5,6</sup>, S D&#x02019;Alfonso<sup>7,8</sup>, N Barizzone<sup>7</sup>, MA Leone<sup>8,9</sup>, F Martinelli Boneschi<sup>10,11</sup>, M Sorosina<sup>11</sup>, G Liberatore<sup>10,11</sup>, I Kockum<sup>12</sup>, T Olsson<sup>12</sup>, J Hillert<sup>12</sup>, L Alfredsson<sup>13</sup>, SK Bedri<sup>12</sup>, B Hemmer<sup>14</sup>, D Buck<sup>14</sup>, A Berthele<sup>14</sup>, B Knier<sup>14</sup>, V Biberacher<sup>14</sup>, V van Pesch<sup>15</sup>, C Sindic<sup>15</sup>, AB Oturai<sup>16</sup>, HB S&#x000f8;ndergaard<sup>16</sup>, F Sellebjerg<sup>16</sup>, PE Jensen<sup>16</sup>, M Comabella<sup>17</sup>, X Montalban<sup>17</sup>, J P&#x000e9;rez-Boza<sup>17</sup>, S Malhotra<sup>17</sup>, J Lechner-Scott<sup>18</sup>, S Broadley<sup>19</sup>, M Slee<sup>20</sup>, B Taylor<sup>21</sup>, A Kermode<sup>22</sup>, P-A Gourraud<sup>23</sup>, S Sawcer<sup>24</sup>, BK Andreassen<sup>25</sup>, B Dubois<sup>1,4</sup>, HF Harbo<sup>2,3</sup>, the International Multiple Sclerosis Genetics Consortium</p><p><sup>1</sup>KU Leuven, Department of Neurosciences, Leuven, Belgium, <sup>2</sup>Oslo University Hospital, Department of Neurology, Oslo, Norway, <sup>3</sup>University of Oslo, Institute of Clinical Medicine, Oslo, Norway, <sup>4</sup>University Hospitals Leuven, Department of Neurology, Leuven, Belgium, <sup>5</sup>Haukeland University Hospital, Department of Neurology, Bergen, Norway, <sup>6</sup>University of Bergen, Department of Clinical Medicine, Bergen, Norway, <sup>7</sup>University of Eastern Piedmont, Department of Health Sciences, Novara, Italy, <sup>8</sup>University of Eastern Piedmont, Interdisciplinary Research Center of Autoimmune Diseases (IRCAD), Novara, Italy, <sup>9</sup>AOU &#x0201c;Maggiore della Carit&#x000e0;&#x0201d;, Novara, Italy, <sup>10</sup>San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Department of Neuro-rehabilitation, Milan, Italy, <sup>11</sup>San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Division of Neuroscience, Milan, Italy, <sup>12</sup>Karolinska Institutet, Department of Clinical Neuroscience, Stockholm, Sweden, <sup>13</sup>Karolinska Institutet, Institute of Environmental Medicine, Stockholm, Sweden, <sup>14</sup>Technische Universit&#x000e4;t M&#x000fc;nchen, Department of Neurology, Munich, Germany, <sup>15</sup>Universit&#x000e9; Catholique de Louvain-la-Neuve, Neurochemistry Unit, Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium, <sup>16</sup>Copenhagen University Hospital, Department of Neurology, Copenhagen, Denmark, <sup>17</sup>Hospital Universitari Vall d&#x02019;Hebron, Institut de Receca Vall d&#x02019;Hebron, Barcelona, Spain, <sup>18</sup>University of Newcastle, Hunter Medical Research Institute, Newcastle, Australia, <sup>19</sup>Griffith University, School of Medicine, Queensland, Australia, <sup>20</sup>Flinders University of South Australia, School of Medicine, Adelaide, Australia, <sup>21</sup>University of Tasmania, Hobart, Australia, <sup>22</sup>University of Western Australia, Centre for Neuromuscular and Neurological Disorders, Crawley, Australia, <sup>23</sup>University of California San Francisco, School of Medicine, San Francisco, CA, United States, <sup>24</sup>University of Cambridge, Department of Clinical Neurosciences, Cambridge, United Kingdom, <sup>25</sup>University of Oslo, Department of Molecular Biology, Oslo, Norway</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Immunological hallmarks of multiple sclerosis (MS) are production of antibodies expressed as oligoclonal bands (OCB) and/or an increased level of immunoglobulin G compared to serum (IgG index) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of MS patients.

This screening phase was followed by a replication in 3,917 additional MS patients from eight countries.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) region is the main determinant of presence of OCBs, with up to two-fold differences in the odds of being OCB positive depending on genotype combinations. We furthermore identify a region near the <italic>ELAC1/SMAD4</italic> genes associated with OCB status. The previously reported Immunoglobulin Heavy Chain (IGHC) region and newly identified signals in the MHC region together explain 10% of the variation in IgG index. Both traits (OCB and IgG index) are associated with clinical features of disease such as female gender, lower age at onset and increased severity.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> This is the largest study so far investigating the genetic influence on antibody production in the CSF in MS, including 6,976 MS patients from nine countries. We confirm that genetic factors underlie antibody production in the CSF in MS and identify both the MHC and IGHC region as major determinants.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section397-1352458514546077"><title>P196</title><sec id="section398-1352458514546077"><title>CSF isoelectric focusing differentiates multiple sclerosis from other CNS autoimmune disorders</title><p><underline>E Bernitsas</underline><sup>1</sup>, F Bao<sup>1</sup>, S Sriwastava<sup>1</sup>, C Caon<sup>1</sup>, A Tselis<sup>1</sup>, S Millis<sup>1</sup>, O Khan<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Wayne State University, Detroit, MI, United States</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> CSF oligoclonal bands (OCB) are one of immunopathologic features of CSF in patients with MS and other CNS autoimmune disorders (CAID).

All patients met the established diagnostic criteria for each disease state, supported by tissue biopsy when indicated.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> 56 patients with MS and 53 patients with other CAID were included in the study. Other CAID included vasculitis (n=6), Sjogren&#x02019;s (n=7), sarcoidosis (n=30), lupus (n=6), and anti-phospholipid antibody syndrome (n=4), all with definite CNS involvement. Mean age in MS group was 36.9 years and other CAID was 38.6 years. Mean number of CSF OCB was 8.5 and 1.7, in the MS and other CAID groups, respectively (p&#x0003c; 0.0001). Mean number of isolated CSF OCB (ISO-OCB) was 7.8 and 1.2 in the MS and other CAID groups respectively (p&#x0003c; 0.0001). In simple logistic regression model, both total number of CSF OCB and ISO-OCB differentiated MS from other CAID, with an odds ratio of 4.1 (p&#x0003c; 0.0001) and 7.8 (p=0.0006), respectively. Receiving Operating Characteristic curve analysis was performed to evaluate the diagnostic efficiency of ISO-OCB in predicting MS. Diagnostic discrimination was excellent (AUC = .985). Model calibration was also excellent (Hosmer-Lemshow chi-square = .67, p = .99). ISO-OCB greater than or equal to 4.50 had a sensitivity of .839 and a specificity of .981. In other words, of the patients with a diagnosis of MS, 83.9% were correctly classified in this sample when using a cutoff score of greater or equal to 4.50. Of the non-MS patients, 98.1% were correctly classified.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> CSF IEF demonstrates significantly higher number of total and isolated CSF OCB and differentiates MS from other CNS autoimmune disorders that also present with CSF OCB. At a cut off 4.5 ISO CSF OCB, MS can be differentiated from other CAID with a sensitivity of 84% and specificity of 98%. This may be a useful tool in clinical practice. Larger studies are warranted.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section399-1352458514546077"><title>P197</title><sec id="section400-1352458514546077"><title>Importance of CSF analysis in the era of McDonald 2010 criteria: a retrospective multicenter study in patients with a clinically isolated syndrome</title><p><underline>H Tumani</underline><sup>1</sup>, C Trebst<sup>2</sup>, A Spreer<sup>3</sup>, N Borisow<sup>4</sup>, A Harrer<sup>5</sup>, I Brecht<sup>6</sup>, M Buttmann<sup>6</sup>, B Balint<sup>7</sup>, O Stich<sup>8</sup>, S Schlegel<sup>9</sup>, A Winkelmann<sup>10</sup>, R Roesler<sup>9</sup>, F Lauda<sup>1</sup>, A Huss<sup>1</sup>, &#x000d6; Yildiz<sup>2</sup>, E Vo&#x000df;<sup>2</sup>, R Muche<sup>9</sup>, S Rauer<sup>8</sup>, F Then Bergh<sup>11</sup>, F Paul<sup>4</sup>, B Wildemann<sup>7</sup>, J Kraus<sup>5</sup>, K Ruprecht<sup>4</sup>, M Stangel<sup>2</sup>, M Otto<sup>9</sup>, UK Zettl<sup>10</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>University Hospital Ulm, Neurology, Ulm, Germany, <sup>2</sup>Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany, <sup>3</sup>University of G&#x000f6;ttingen, G&#x000f6;ttingen, Germany, <sup>4</sup>Charit&#x000e9; - Universit&#x000e4;tsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany, <sup>5</sup>Paracelsus Medizinische Privatuniversit&#x000e4;t, Salzburg, Austria, <sup>6</sup>University of W&#x000fc;rzburg, W&#x000fc;rzburg, Germany, <sup>7</sup>University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany, <sup>8</sup>University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany, <sup>9</sup>University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany, <sup>10</sup>University of Rostock, Rostock, Germany, <sup>11</sup>University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> The majority of patients presenting with a clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) suggestive of multiple sclerosis (MS) do not fulfil the MRI criteria for dissemination in space and time according to McDonald 2010 criteria for diagnosis of MS.

By using 12 color flow cytometry combined with enhanced counting of immune cells in 50 times concentrated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), we were also able to define extensive abnormalities of the intrathecal immunity in untreated relapsing-remitting MS (RR-MS) patients.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> The purpose of this study was to use the same methodology for assessing intrathecal effects of long-term (&#x0003e;2 years) DAC therapy.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> All samples (N=65) were assigned an alpha-numeric code and personnel performing the studies were blinded to the diagnosis of the subjects.

Specifically, the strong CSF enrichment of cells belonging to adaptive immunity (CD4, activated HLA-DR-expressing CD4 T cells, and plasmablasts) was completely normalized by long-term DAC therapy. Similarly, the MS-characteristic deviations of intrathecal innate immunity was likewise normalized by DAC therapy: specifically, the dramatic decrease of monocytes and increase in innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) was reverted to HD levels. Thus, difference between untreated RR-MS patients and HD or DAC-treated patients was highly statistically significant for all of these biomarkers, whereas no significant differences were identified between HD and DAC cohorts. DAC therapy also leads to profound increase in immunoregulatory CD56<sup>bright</sup> NK cells, both in the blood and CSF. This change was described before and distinguishes both untreated RR-MS and HD cohorts from patients on long-term DAC therapy.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our study provides strong evidence that all MS-related abnormalities of intrathecal immune responses have been normalized in patients on long-term DAC therapy, consistent with our observations that clinical and imaging markers of MS disease activity have been eliminated by this therapeutic modality in patients who tolerate this treatment long-term.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section403-1352458514546077"><title>P199</title><sec id="section404-1352458514546077"><title>Intrathecal B-cell response in multiple sclerosis brain recognizes auto-antigens</title><p>DL Walker<sup>1</sup>, CE Estrem<sup>1</sup>, SW Anderson<sup>1</sup>, B Miller<sup>1</sup>, <underline>MP Burgoon</underline><sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>University of Colorado School of Medicine, Neurology, Aurora, CO, United States</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the central nervous system (CNS) with demyelination and neuronal damage.

Eight rAbs variously stained human cell lines of CNS or peripheral origin, including oligodendroglial, astroglial, neuronal, fibroblastic and epithelial cells.

These data suggest that the intrathecal B cell response in MS reacts against autoimmune antigens, while the initiating factors for this response are unknown. This B cell response may act as antigen-presenting cells that mediate demyelination or neurodegeneration in MS.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section405-1352458514546077"><title>P200</title><sec id="section406-1352458514546077"><title>Increased intrathecal inflammation in progressive multiple sclerosis</title><p><underline>M Komori</underline><sup>1</sup>, A Blake<sup>1</sup>, Y-C Lin<sup>1</sup>, D Ghazali<sup>1</sup>, P Kosa<sup>1</sup>, P Winokur<sup>1</sup>, M Natrajan<sup>1</sup>, E Romm<sup>1</sup>, T Wu<sup>1</sup>, B Bielekova<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>NIH, NINDS, Bethesda, MD, United States</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Lack of therapeutic efficacy of immunomodulatory therapies in progressive multiple sclerosis (MS) has been interpreted as evidence that neurodegeneration rather than immunopathology drives central nervous system (CNS) tissue destruction in progressive MS.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To assess presence of intrathecal inflammation in patients with different MS subtypes <italic>in vivo</italic> by combining immunophenotyping of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cells with measurements of immune-cell specific soluble biomarkers.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> CSF of 418 subjects, including relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS), secondary-progressive MS (SPMS), primary-progressive MS (PPMS), non-inflammatory neurological disorders (NIND), other inflammatory neurological disorders (OIND), and healthy donors (HD) were collected and processed in a blinded fashion using standardized protocol. Electroluminescent assay system was optimized to quantify soluble biomarkers in the CSF supernatant, including soluble CD14 (sCD14), sCD163, sCD21, sCD23, and sCD27. Cellular origin of all measured biomarkers was assessed from purified immune cell subtypes isolated from three HD and stimulated in-vitro. Absolute numbers of CSF immune cells were quantified by flow cytometry in 50-fold concentrated CSF, and were compared with cell-specific soluble biomarkers.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> In contrast to enrichment of CSF T cells and B cells in RRMS only, all MS groups had elevated CSF levels of B cell-specific (sCD21) and T cell-specific (sCD27) biomarkers as compare to NIND and HD (p&#x0003c; 0.05 for all). Monocyte/microglial biomarker CSF sCD14 level was elevated in SPMS and PPMS compared to RRMS and NIND (p&#x0003c; 0.05). RRMS and SPMS showed higher level of sCD23, which originates both from B cells and monocytes/macrophages. OIND showed the highest mean levels of all inflammatory soluble biomarkers which corresponded to highest numbers of CSF immune cells.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> While elevated levels of soluble cell-specific biomarkers in OIND and RRMS groups corresponded to high absolute numbers of CSF immune cells, we observed significant elevation of soluble immune biomarkers in progressive MS groups, despite the fact that their numbers of CSF immune cells are comparable to those of NIND and HD. Our results indicate that the sources of soluble immune biomarkers in progressive MS are non-mobile cells residing in CNS tissue. Our methodology has potential to guide development of new immunomodulatory therapies with high CNS penetrance that will be necessary for inhibiting intrathecal inflammation in patients with progressive MS.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section407-1352458514546077"><title>P201</title><sec id="section408-1352458514546077"><title>Diagnostic and prognostic significance of intrathecal synthesis of immunoglobulin free light chains in MS</title><p><underline>V Nazarov</underline><sup>1</sup>, S Lapin<sup>1</sup>, E Surkova<sup>1</sup>, E Kairbekova<sup>2</sup>, G Makshakov<sup>2</sup>, E Evdoshenko<sup>2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>First Pavlov State Medical University, Saint-Petersburg, Russian Federation, <sup>2</sup>Saint-Petersburg City Clinical Hospital #31, Saint-Petersburg Center MS and Autoimmune Diseases, Saint-Petersburg, Russian Federation</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Increased intrathecal synthesis of immunoglobulins and oligoclonal synthesis (OCB) are among the major immunological findings in MS.

High IL-8 levels were associated with clinical progression (89% versus 22%, p=0.01) in RIS patients, and to higher risk of conversion to MS (79% versus 40%, p=0.02) in CIS. Also a lower time to conversion was observed for both RIS (10.2&#x000b1;5.3 versus 19.5&#x000b1;0.7 months; p&#x0003c; 0.05) and CIS (8.1&#x000b1;3.7 versus 15.1&#x000b1;4.5 months; p&#x0003c; 0.01) in high IL-8 group.

There was no primary progressive MS (PPMS) patient. The mean disease duration and the mean EDSS score of MS patients including CIS and RIS patients were 59.8&#x000b1;71.4 months and 2.6&#x000b1;1.8 respectively. 69% of them met all the Barhoff criteria.

Although most of the samples were diagnosed as MS according to both clinical and paraclinical (MRI) criteria, they had only a single Ig band in CSF. Not only OCBs, but also an isolated CSF monoclonal band may be a cornerstone for the diagnosis of MS at least for some patients. On the other hand, single CSF band is an indication for repeating a CSF analysis, unless other criteria clearly point to a diagnosis of MS, and to consider an alternative diagnosis. Patients with an isolated CSF monoclonal band need careful consideration.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section417-1352458514546077"><title>P206</title><sec id="section418-1352458514546077"><title>Lipid-specific oligoclonal IgM bands: is there any influence on the response to treatment with fingolimod?</title><p><underline>L P&#x000e9;rez-Romero</underline><sup>1</sup>, C Alcal&#x000e1;<sup>2</sup>, F P&#x000e9;rez-Miralles<sup>2</sup>, F Gasc&#x000f3;n<sup>3</sup>, A Navarr&#x000e9;<sup>3</sup>, I Bosc&#x000e1;<sup>2</sup>, M Sim&#x000f3;-Castell&#x000f3;<sup>4</sup>, L Landete<sup>1</sup>, F Coret<sup>3</sup>, B Casanova<sup>2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Hospital Universitari Doctor Peset, Neurology Department, Valencia, Spain, <sup>2</sup>Hospital Universitari i Polit&#x000e8;cnic La Fe, MS Unit - Neurology Department, Valencia, Spain, <sup>3</sup>Hospital Cl&#x000ed;nico Universitario, Unit of Neuroimmunology - Neurology Department, Valencia, Spain, <sup>4</sup>Hospital Universitari i Polit&#x000e8;cnic La Fe, Laboratory of Immunology, Valencia, Spain</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> The presence of lipid-specific oligoclonal IgM bands (LS-OCMB) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) has been related to a poorer response to first-line therapies. Fingolimod (FGM) is an antagonist of the sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor, licensed in Europe as second-line agent, although the pivotal studies were not intended to aggressive forms of multiple sclerosis (MS).</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To investigate whether the presence of LS-OCMB in the CSF influences the response to treatment with FGM in relapsing-remitting MS patients.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> This is a retrospective analysis of 150 patients from 3 tertiary referral hospitals from Valencia (Spain), who began treatment with FGM, 89 of them followed-up &#x02265;12 months. We finally selected those patients in which the presence or not of LS-OCMB was tested (n=50). Presence of attacks and the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) were assessed at least every 6 months. Demographic and baseline clinical and presence of further attacks or sustained EDSS worsening during follow-up were compared using nonparametric test. Survival curves to first attack after FGM therapy were obtained.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> In the final cohort, mean age was 34.1 years (SD 7.5), mean evolution time was 7.7 years (SD 6.3) and median follow-up time was 28.5 months (IQR 21.3). Median EDSS 12 months previous to treatment (EDSSpre) with FGM was 2.5 (IQR 1.5) and mean annualized relapse rate (ARR) in the year before FGM was 1.5 (SD 1.9). Nine patients were na&#x000ef;ve patients (18%), 25 (50%) had previously received first-line therapy and 16 (32%) second-line therapy. LS-OCMB were present in 14 patients (28%). Baseline clinical characteristics differed between negative and positive LS-OCMB patients. Negative LS-OCMB patients started treatment at higher age (mean age 35.3 years [SD 7.5] vs 30.9 [SD 6.6], p=0.055), with higher EDSS (median 3.0 [IQR 2.0] vs 2.0 [IQR 0.5] p=0.008) and, although not stadistically significant, later (mean time to FGM start 8.1 years [SD 6.9] vs 4.4 [SD 3.7], p=0.243). Nevertheless, there were no statistically significant differences in the time to first attack after FGM or in the EDSS change after FGM related to the presence of LS-OCMB. Median global survival to first attack after FGM was 90 months.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> There are no differences in the response to FGM therapy between negative and positive LS-OCMB MS patients. Differences in age and EDSS between negative and positive LS-OCMB are probably attributable to the former having longer times to failure to first-line therapies.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section419-1352458514546077"><title>P207</title><sec id="section420-1352458514546077"><title>miR-142-3p expression in multiple sclerosis cerebrospinal fluid is related to better cognitive performance</title><p><underline>L Rami&#x000f3;-Torrent&#x000e0;</underline><sup>1,2</sup>, E Quintana<sup>2</sup>, R Men&#x000e9;ndez<sup>2</sup>, R Robles-Cede&#x000f1;o<sup>1,2</sup>, H Perkal<sup>2</sup>, FJ Ortega<sup>3</sup>, JM Fern&#x000e1;ndez-Real<sup>3</sup>, J Gich<sup>1,2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Neuroimmunology and Multiple Sclerosis Unit, Dr. Josep Trueta University Hospital, Department of Neurology, Girona, Spain, <sup>2</sup>Girona Biomedical Research Institute (IDIBGI), Neurodegeneration and Neuroinflamation Group, Girona, Spain, <sup>3</sup>Endocrinology and Nutrition (UDEN), Girona Biomedical Research Institute (IDIBGI), and CIBER de la Fisiopatolog&#x000ed;a de la Obesidad y la Nutrici&#x000f3;n (CIBERobn, CB06/03), Department of Diabetes, Girona, Spain</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Multiple sclerosis (MS) is associated with both physical and cognitive dysfunction that is present in 65% of patients and is characterized by memory, learning, attention and information-processing impairment. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs that regulate the gene expression. miRNAs are present in biological fluids and might be used as disease biomarkers.

Sometimes the initial diagnosis can be difficult because optic neuritis and/or myelitis are clinical syndromes shared to all these medical conditions. Because cytokines (CK) profile could express different pathogenic processes, we have hypothesized that determination of CFS CK profile could help to distinguish among patients with different forms of CRIDD.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To compare the CSF CK profile in 3 forms of CRIDD (MS, NMO and CRION/RION) and in a control group.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> We have studied 72 patients: 7 control patients (non-inflammatory neurological diseases); 55 MS patients with nodular or diffuse spinal cord affectation; 5 NMO patients (all anti-NMO+) and 5 CRION patients (2 anti-MOG+). In all patients, the following CK have been determined by Luminex<sup><bold>&#x000ae;</bold></sup>: IL1&#x003b2;, IL1RA, IL2, IL4, IL5, IL6, IL8, IL9, IL10, IL12p40, IL12p70, IL13, IL17A, IL17F, IL18,IL21 IL22, IL23, IL27, IFN-&#x003b3;, GM-CSF and TNF-&#x003b1;. One-way analysis of variance with Bonferroni&#x02019;s adjustment was performed to detect differences between control and CRIDD patients&#x02019; groups. Adjusted significance level was set at p=0.0042.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> There were no significant differences in the CSF CK profile between control and CRIDD patients&#x02019; groups, except for IL6 (p&#x0003c; 0.0001) and IL8 (p=0.0003). Bonferroni adjustment showed that the IL-6 and IL-8 CSF levels were significantly higher in NMO patients than in control and MS patients, and probably higher than in CRION/RION patients (IL6: p=0.001 NMO vs. control; p&#x0003c; 0.001 NMO vs. MS; p=0.008 NMO vs. CRION/RION), (IL8: p&#x0003c; 0.002 NMO vs. control; p&#x0003c; 0.001 NMO vs. MS; p=0.007 NMO vs. CRION/RION). There were not differences in IL6 and IL8 CSF levels between control, MS or CRION/RION patients.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> IL6 has been related with NMO, and with spinal cord affectation in MS patients, but IL8, a CK related to the permeability of the blood brain barrier, has only been studied in cases of optico-spinal MS. Our results show that IL8 is at higher levels only in cases of NMO, and not in MS patients, despite we selected MS patients with nodular and diffuse spinal cord affectation. High levels of IL6 and IL8 in the CSF are restricted to NMO patients, and could help to distinguish between the different CRIDD in the diagnosis of initial optic neuritis/myelitis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section423-1352458514546077"><title>P209</title><sec id="section424-1352458514546077"><title>Post-dural puncture headache is markedly reduced when 25 Sprotte needles are used</title><p><underline>A Bertolotto</underline><sup>1</sup>, Y Motuzova<sup>1</sup>, F Sperli<sup>1</sup>, M Capobianco<sup>1</sup>, M Malentacchi<sup>1</sup>, A Pulizzi<sup>1</sup>, S Malucchi<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>AOU San Luigi Gonzaga, Neurologia 2 - Centro Riferimento Regionale Sclerosi Multipla (CRESM), Orbassano, Italy</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> AAN Guidelines (2005) suggest the use of 22 gauge (G) atraumatic Sprotte needle; however in clinical practice the 20G traumatic needle is the most used one.

The patient was blinded for the needle used; a neurologist, blinded for the type of the needle, interviewed the patient for PDPH. Safety and time consuming were evaluated.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> PDPH developed in 35.9% using 20G Quincke needle, in 12.9% using 22G Sprotte needle, in 6.8% using 25G Whitacre needle and in 1.6% using 25G Sprotte needle. The incidence of PDPH with 25S was significantly lower than 20Q and 22S (p&#x0003c; 0.0001 and p&#x0003c; 0.002 respectively) and it approached significance with 25W (p=0.06). PDPH was not correlated with CSF volume collected, patient&#x02019;s age, sex, body mass index, position during cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) collection, suspected diagnosis, and previous lumbar punctures (LP). The median expected pain was similar in the four groups, ranging from 7 to 8 in the Eleven Point Box Scale and the median experienced pain was definitively lower, ranging from 3 to 4 (p &#x0003c; 0.0001 for all needles). The experienced pain was similar with the 4 needles, unaffected by the introducer and CSF aspiration. The median time spent with 20Q was 3 min, shorter than with 22S (5 min), with 25W (15 min) and 25S (7 min). The median velocity of (CSF) efflux, spontaneous or aspired, was higher with 20Q (2.7 ml/min) and 22S (3 ml/min), than with 25S (2 ml/min) and 25W (0.8 ml/min). The volume of CSF collected ranged from 3 to 20ml, with median values 9, 15, 10 and 13 for 20Q, 22S, 25W and 25S, respectively. The amount of CSF was higher with Sprotte needles, both 22S and 25S.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> PDPH is influenced by diameter and shape of the tip of the needles and indicated that 25S needle is associated with very low frequency of PDPH. Diagnostic LP with 25S needle is safe and it can be performed in everyday clinical practice but requires higher skill and more time than traditional LP.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section425-1352458514546077"><title>P210</title><sec id="section426-1352458514546077"><title>Oligoclonal bands predict multiple sclerosis in children with isolated optic neuritis: a retrospective multicenter cohort study</title><p><underline>N Heu&#x000df;inger</underline><sup>1,2</sup>, E Kontopantelis<sup>3</sup>, A Jenke<sup>4</sup>, P Hofstetter<sup>5</sup>, B Kornek<sup>6</sup>, S Lutz<sup>7</sup>, I Brecht<sup>8</sup>, M Smitka<sup>9</sup>, A Blaschek<sup>10</sup>, K Rostasy<sup>11</sup>, S Karch<sup>12</sup>, R Trollmann<sup>2</sup>, M H&#x000e4;u&#x000df;ler<sup>13</sup>, M Buttmann<sup>8</sup>, German-Speaking Research Alliance for ChildrEn with MS (GRACE-MS)</p><p><sup>1</sup>Children&#x02019;s Hospital Aschaffenburg, Aschaffenburg, Germany, <sup>2</sup>University of Erlangen, Department of Neuropediatrics, Erlangen, Germany, <sup>3</sup>University of Manchester, Institute of Population Health, Manchester, United Kingdom, <sup>4</sup>University of Witten/Herdecke, Centre of Paediatrics and Youth Medicine, Witten/Herdecke, Germany, <sup>5</sup>University of Frankfurt, Department of Neuropediatrics, Frankfurt, Germany, <sup>6</sup>University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria, <sup>7</sup>University of Essen, Department of Neuropediatrics, Essen, Germany, <sup>8</sup>University of W&#x000fc;rzburg, Department of Neurology, W&#x000fc;rzburg, Germany, <sup>9</sup>Carl Gustav Carus University Dresden, Dresden, Germany, <sup>10</sup>Julius-Maximilian-University Munich, Dr. von Haunersches Kinderspital, Munich, Germany, <sup>11</sup>University of Innsbruck, Department of Neuropediatrics, Innsbruck, Austria, <sup>12</sup>University of Heidelberg, Department of Neuropediatrics, Heidelberg, Germany, <sup>13</sup>University of W&#x000fc;rzburg, Department of Neuropediatrics, W&#x000fc;rzburg, Germany</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Isolated optic neuritis (ON) in childhood may remain a singular event or indicate the clinical beginning of multiple sclerosis (MS).

There was no correlation between valus of IgM index and IgG index.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> According to our data, intrathecal IgM synthesis is associated with a worse long term prognosis. It correlates with a higher relapse rate, more disability, and worse MRI outcomes. Early observation of increased IgM index will be a helpful tool for clinicians to select patients for early immunomodulatory or immunosuppressant treatments.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section429-1352458514546077"><title>P212</title><sec id="section430-1352458514546077"><title>Lipid-specific oligoclonal IgM bands and cognition in early stages of multiple sclerosis</title><p><underline>J Gich</underline><sup>1,2</sup>, R Men&#x000e9;ndez<sup>2</sup>, E Quintana<sup>2</sup>, N Pueyo<sup>2</sup>, R Robles-Cede&#x000f1;o<sup>1,2</sup>, H Perkal<sup>1</sup>, I Toboso<sup>3</sup>, LM Villar<sup>3</sup>, L Rami&#x000f3;-Torrent&#x000e0;<sup>1,2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Neuroimmunology and Multiple Sclerosis Unit, Dr. Josep Trueta University Hospital, Department of Neurology, Girona, Spain, <sup>2</sup>Girona Biomedical Research Institute (IDIBGI), Neurodegeneration and Neuroinflamation Group, Girona, Spain, <sup>3</sup>Hospital Universitario Ram&#x000f3;n y Cajal.

The cognitive performance of MS patients were classified as &#x0201c;normal&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;mild&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;moderate&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;severe&#x0201d; depending on the number of tests failed with 1 standard deviation lower than the average. We also classified cognitive evolution as &#x0201c;normal performance&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;cognitive improvement&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;cognitive impairment&#x0201d; depending on the change in their performance at 12 month of follow-up.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> 50 patients were assessed at baseline and 19 patients at 12 months of follow-up. No significant differences were observed between patients with negative or positive LS-OCMB and cognitive performance at baseline and at 12 months, and the change in the cognitive status. No significant differences were also observed in cognitive domains between groups at baseline and at 12 months of follow-up.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> No differences in cognitive performance and neuropsychological domains between patients with positive or negative LS-OCMB were observed in early stages of the disease. These results are in agreement with clinical and radiological data, where differences could not be observed at the onset of the disease. More follow-up studies are needed to evaluate if changes in cognitive performance in this two groups of patients appear over time.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section431-1352458514546077"><title>P213</title><sec id="section432-1352458514546077"><title>A retrospective study of the association between leucocytes, IgG-index, oligoclonale bands and age in demyelinating disease</title><p><underline>M B&#x000fc;low</underline><sup>1</sup>, JL Frederiksen<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Glostrup Hospital, University of Copenhagen, Neurology, Glostrup, Denmark</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patients typically have a characteristic composition of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). There are no previous studies of the correlation between CSF composition and age in patients with MS.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> The study aims to analyze data on CSF including finding a possible link between leucocytes, IgG-index, oligoclonal bands, and age of MS in consecutive patients at the MS Clinic, Glostrup Hospital.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> A retrospective study of all patients evaluated at the MS Clinic in the years 1999-2013. The inclusion criteria are known onset date, known date of lumbar puncture and one of the following diagnosis: MS, CIS or ON. In all 1471 patients. The statistical calculations are based on a CIS-ON group and a RRMS group where patients are subdivided into whether or not they have had ON at any time.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> A possible relationship between leukocyte count in CSF, IgG-index, OB and age was examined. White blood cell (WBC) counts and IgG index tended to be lower the older the patients were. There was no correlation between the presence of OB and age.

IgG form immune complexes with the antigen and generate negative feedback regulation through crosslinking the B cell receptor with the IgG inhibitory receptor Fc&#x003b3;RIIB, which inhibits BCR signaling and thereby B cell activation and IgG Ab production. Recent studies showed that asialylated IgG antibody are proinflammatory and induced by the combination of T cell-dependent protein antigens and proinflammatory costimulation.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To determine IgG antibody sialylation in the CSF and paired serum of patients with multiple sclerosis.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Purified IgG antibody in CSF and paired serum from 12 MS patients and 9 inflammatory CNS controls were quantified for sialic acid levels using immunoblots probed with biotinylated lectin Sambucus nigra agglutinin (SNA) specific for sialic acid, followed by detection with HRP-conjugated NeutrAvidin.

Inclusion criteria: remittent type of the disease course, duration of the disease longer than 5 years, disability status not exceeding 6.5 points on the EDSS. Exclusion criteria: immunomodulatory therapy. The following parameters were measured in CSF by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay: interleukin-1 level, tumour necrosis factor (TNF-&#x003b1;), C-reactive protein, protein S100, myelin basic protein (MBP), matrix metalloproteinase-2 (&#x0041c;&#x0041c;&#x00420;-2), thrombomodulin, soluble VE-cadherin, von Willebrand factor, soluble platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule -1 (sPECAM-1), soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1). Albumin level was measured in blood plasma (BP) using bromocresol green method and in CSF using immunoturbidimetric method.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Compared to remission period, the level of TNF-&#x003b1; was increased by 5.1 times (&#x00440;=0.031), MBP - by 2.3 times (&#x00440;=0.046), sPECAM-1 - by 4.3 times (&#x00440;=0.024) and sVCAM-1 - by 3.7 times (&#x00440;=0.035) during the relapse period. Besides CSF albumin compared to BP albumin as 0.010&#x000b1;0.001 vs 0.004&#x000b1;0.001 (&#x00440; = 0.012). The risk of rapid progression of MS (annual disability progress is faster than 0.75 points on the EDSS) is increased when the level of sPECAM-1 exceeds 5 ng/ml (OR=4.2; 1.2-8.9; &#x00440;=0.018), the level of sVCAM-1 exceeds 29 ng/ml (OR=3.3; 1.0-9.4; &#x00440;=0.021), and the level of MMP-2 is higher than 49 ng/ml (OR=3.1; 2.3-4.4; &#x00440;=0.023).

However, a common limitation of such registries is the insufficient ability to extract meaningful data, thus rendering registries&#x02019; role to archiving tools, usably only by a small number of researchers.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> We set out to design and implement a Visualization and Analysis Platform (VAP) connected to the Swedish MS Registry (SMSreg) to allow all users the monitoring of their local data and results of care in comparison to national data, including immediate statistical analysis of selected outcome parameters using predefined graphical and table-form template reports.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> A VAP was built in SQL and R language, using a large collection of R-libraries including a new and powerful web framework Shiny (<italic>&#x000a9; RStudio, Inc.</italic>). The platform is based on predefined types of analyses such as flexible tabular presentations, cross-sectional and longitudinal comparisons, linear models, comparisons between domains (spider diagrams) and advanced statistical analyses (e.g. locally weighted fitting to experimental data, survival analysis). A user interface with reactive programming was implemented to control the appearance of interactive graphs and tables, and to explore the changes in outcome parameters.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> A web-based platform for live visualization and interactive statistical analysis of data was developed and linked to SMSreg containing 15,000 patients and over 80,000 registered neurological visits. Operations are intuitively controlled via a flexible user interface, supported by different graphical selection tools. Automatic reports are functionally divided into subgroups customized for users&#x02019; needs and access rights. They contain various types of analyses: SMSreg&#x02019;s content (quantity and density of data, descriptive statistics), clinical follow-up, quality assurance (access to MS care, effective investigation and monitoring of patients, adequate DMD treatment), annual reports, patients&#x02019; reported outcomes and some analyses of research character, e.g. survival analysis of drugs. Selected tables and figures are open for the public on county and national levels.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> VAP offers a range of visualization and analysis options for graphical and table-form reports applied in real-time on SMSreg&#x02019;s data. It fills a need of providing data back to clinicians, patients and researchers, thereby hopefully motivating registration, and increasing quality and density of data.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section440-1352458514546077"><title>P217</title><sec id="section441-1352458514546077"><title>Leveraging electronic health records for a phenome-wide examination of the comorbidity burden associated with multiple sclerosis disease outcome</title><p><underline>M Goodman</underline><sup>1</sup>, B Healy<sup>2</sup>, T Cai<sup>3</sup>, HL Weiner<sup>2</sup>, T Chitnis<sup>2</sup>, PL De Jager<sup>4,5</sup>, Z Xia<sup>4,5</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Harvard University, Department of Statistics, Cambridge, MA, United States, <sup>2</sup>Brigham and Women&#x02019;s Hospital, Department of Neurology, Boston, MA, United States, <sup>3</sup>Harvard School of Public Health, Department of Biostatistics, Boston, MA, United States, <sup>4</sup>Brigham and Women&#x02019;s Hospital, Program in Translational NeuroPsychiatric Genomics, Department of Neurology, Boston, MA, United States, <sup>5</sup>Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, United States</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Comorbid conditions can impact disease outcome and course in multiple sclerosis (MS).</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To perform a phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) to identify comorbidities associated with severe MS disability. We hypothesize that such approach can uncover heretofore unknown associations.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Merging data from an algorithm-defined MS cohort derived from the Partners HealthCare electronic health record (EHR) system with a clinic-based, MS natural history cohort, we report an integrated analysis of all International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-9 codes from the EHR with all Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) measures from a research database for each of the 3010 MS patients (72% female, 86% Caucasian). Each ICD-9 code is mapped to existing curated phenome-wide ontology. We set EDSS&#x0003e;=6 as a threshold to identify patients who had ever experienced severe disability (n=1010). Each ICD-9 code is tested for association with EDSS status (ever&#x0003e;=6 v. never) using logistic regression with EDSS as predictor, adjusting for sex, race, smoking, age at symptom onset, disease duration, and progressive course at onset.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> After Bonferroni correction, this PheWAS identified 38 unique ICD-9 codes. Consistent with expected disabilities, the strongest associations with ever EDSS&#x0003e;=6 are bladder dysfunction (e.g., functional bladder disorder: n=391, OR=4.4, p=2.2e-28), abnormal gait (n=167, OR=4.1, p=3.3e-13), and muscle spasm (n=75, OR=14.6, p=3.9e-13). Other expected associations include infections (e.g., urinary tract infection: n=337, OR=2.9, p=3.8e-14), mood disorders, osteoporosis, and adverse effects of adrenal cortical steroids. In addition, we found less obvious comorbidities: fever of unknown origin (n=178, OR=2.6, p=2.0E-07), disorders of fluid and electrolyte imbalance (n=102, OR=3.7, p=2.3e-7), venous embolism and thrombosis (n=61, OR=4.5, p=2.6e-6), and respiratory failure (n=31, OR=10.5, p=9.0e-6). Finally, we found intriguing associations with cardiac dysrhythmias (n=263, OR=1.8, p=0.00024), myocardial infarction (n=30, OR=3.8, p=0.0031), and type 2 diabetes (n=101, OR=2.2, p=0.0028), as well as inverse associations with benign skin neoplasm (n=248, OR=0.52, p=0.00018) and breast lump or mass (n=142, OR=0.44, p=0.00045) at a suggestive level of evidence.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The phenome-wide approach highlights clinically relevant parameters to monitor and improve in severe MS.

However, its use is limited by susceptibility to progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) in patients with serological evidence of exposure to JC virus, in whom PML risk ranges from 0.7% to 1.4% depending on their history of prior immunosuppression. Current therapeutic practice in adults is based on a standard 300 mg dose administered q4 weeks, aimed at maintaining maximal saturation of the &#x003b1;4&#x003b2;1 integrin receptor throughout the treatment cycle. We hypothesize that an extended dose (ED) NTZ schedule may result in sub-maximal receptor saturation thereby mitigating PML risk while maintaining therapeutic efficacy.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To establish Natalizumab Extended Dose Registry (NEDR) - a global registry of MS patients on ED NTZ administration.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> The Registry is maintained at NYU MS Center. Data is collected anonymously without patient identifiers. A standard questionnaire has been developed to pool clinical and radiological data for patients on ED schedule - requiring at least 3 consecutive NTZ doses administered q4.5 wks - 8.5 weeks, after &#x02265;6-month initiation on standard q4wk schedule.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The aims and structure of the Registry will be presented in detail as well as our preliminary 6-center experience with extended dosing, which encompasses 950 patient-years. Thus far, information on 601 patients has been obtained, with ED annualized relapse rate 0.12 and no cases of PML encountered over 680 JCV-antibody positive person-years (p=0.198).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> To date excellent efficacy profile of the drug appears maintained. Absence of PML cases is encouraging, though a statistically significant decrease in PML has not yet been established, which may be due to low power of the study. Further patient recruitment and longer follow-up are required.

Moreover, published Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorders (NMOSD) case series tend to originate in the developed countries, while this disease appears to be more prevalent in parts of the developing world. MSBase is a unique observational registry that can be freely joined by any neurologist in the world and used as a specialized electronic medical record for patients with neuroinflammatory disorders. MSBase allows for customized substudies to be created for specific subpopulations.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To describe NMOBase, a Web-based, global observational registry within MSBase designed for the clinical care and study of patients with NMOSD.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> We created NMOBase as a substudy of MSBase with specialized fields to capture NMO-specific information (eg NMO diagnostic criteria, NMO IgG serostatus) both at registration and follow-up visits. NMOBase allows clinicians to input detailed information about relapse history, disability, MRI changes, treatment switches, etc at each clinic visit and to analyze the data for individual patients as well as aggregates.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Since its launch in 2013, 13 neurologists from 6 countries on 5 continents enrolled 46 patients with NMOSD into NMOBase; of whom 79% were women. The mean age at registration and mean disease duration were 41.4 &#x000b1;12.3 and 9.2 &#x000b1;8.6 years respectively. Caucasians constituted 44% of the cohort, followed by 18% Hispanics, 18% of Turkish and 13% of Asian descent. Median EDSS was 3 and 22% required ambulatory assistance. The most widely used therapy was Azathioprine, followed by oral Prednisone and Rituximab, but several patients were on Multiple Sclerosis disease-modifying therapies.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> NMOBase allows any neurologist with Internet access to maintain a comprehensive electronic medical record on their NMOSD patients. Longitudinal data collected as part of routine care can then be used for evaluating outcomes in NMO and comparative studies of patients from different regions/ethnicities. NMOBase has the potential to become a sufficiently large and representative cohort to allow for statistically meaningful evaluation of treatments and outcomes. If successful, NMOBase can serve as model for the study of other orphan diseases.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section446-1352458514546077"><title>P220</title><sec id="section447-1352458514546077"><title>Argentinean registry of patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis treated with fingolimod (REAL): design and results of interim analysis</title><p>G <underline>Seifer</underline><sup>1</sup>, GA Kuperman<sup>1</sup>, A Villa<sup>2</sup>, F Caceres<sup>3</sup>, G Herrera<sup>4</sup>, R Rey<sup>5</sup>, M Parada Marcilla<sup>2</sup>, C Calvo Vildoso<sup>6</sup>, G Arguello<sup>7</sup>, V Parisi<sup>2</sup>, R Neme<sup>8</sup>, V Sinay<sup>9</sup>, JM Blasco<sup>10</sup>, P Labal<sup>11</sup>, M Burgos<sup>4</sup>, N Deri<sup>12</sup>, R Linares<sup>13</sup>, S Vetere<sup>14</sup>, M Jacobo<sup>15</sup>, M Golberg<sup>14</sup>, A Castronuovo<sup>1</sup>, Real Study Group</p><p><sup>1</sup>Novartis Argentina SA, Medical, Buenos Aires, Argentina, <sup>2</sup>Office, Buenos Aires, Argentina, <sup>3</sup>INEBA, Buenos Aires, Argentina, <sup>4</sup>Office, Salta, Argentina, <sup>5</sup>IADIN, Buenos Aires, Argentina, <sup>6</sup>Office, Santa Fe, Argentina, <sup>7</sup>Office, Santa Cruz, Argentina, <sup>8</sup>Office, Mendoza, Argentina, <sup>9</sup>Fundacion Favaloro, Buenos Aires, Argentina, <sup>10</sup>Office, Mar del Plata, Argentina, <sup>11</sup>Office, Ushuaia, Argentina, <sup>12</sup>DIABAID, Buenos Aires, Argentina, <sup>13</sup>Office, Bahia Blanca, Argentina, <sup>14</sup>Office, La Plata, Argentina, <sup>15</sup>Office, Santiago del Estero, Argentina</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Once-daily oral fingolimod (Gilenya) is approved in Argentina for the treatment of relapsing multiple sclerosis (MS) since April 2011. Despite the fact that many registries provided real word data on fingolimod safety and efficacy, scarce data exists in South American countries.

All patients currently enrolled in the REAL registry were included. The study collects safety, efficacy and adherence data at baseline, first dose observation visit and every three months thereafter.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> 48 patients were analysed (2 patients were not included in the analysis but continued under fingolimod treatment). Mean age was 39 &#x000b1; 6 years, 36 (75%) were women, mean EDSS at baseline was 2.7 &#x000b1; 2.3 SD. Mean time since the disease was diagnosed was 9.1&#x000b1; 4.1 SD years. 72.9% of patients used previous DMTs. Mean time under fingolimod treatment was 8.5 &#x000b1; 4.2 SD months up to this interim analysis.

However, post-marketing surveillance is important for the determination of long-term safety and efficacy outcome measures in the real-world setting. Therefore, when NTZ was launched in Sweden in August 2006, the &#x0201c;Immunomodulation and Multiple Sclerosis Epidemiology&#x0201d; (IMSE) study was initiated.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To follow-up the long-term safety and efficacy of NTZ in a real-world setting.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> MS patients in Sweden are registered into the nationwide web-based Swedish MS registry (SMSreg). The IMSE study includes descriptive data of AEs, extended disability status scale (EDSS), MS severity scale (MSSS), symbol digit modalities <italic>test</italic> (SDMT), MS impact scale (MSIS-29) and relapses obtained from SMSreg. Blood samples are collected at baseline, 6, 12 and 24 months.</p><p>The Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test was used to assess changes in in efficacy scores.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> 2,368 patients have been included in the IMSE study until April 2014. 86% of the patients have RRMS (7.7% missing data on MS type). The mean treatment duration is 35 months, the mean age at treatment start is 36 years and 72% are female.</p><p>1,140 patients (48%) terminated treatment at some point, of which 237 later restarted. 1,356 patients are currently being treated with NTZ. The two main reasons for ending treatment are; anti-JC virus antibody positivity (JCV+) (39%) and pregnancy/planned pregnancy (17%). 23% of patients with ongoing treatment are JCV+.</p><p>In patients treated with NTZ continuously for &#x02265;5 years (n=412), long lasting, significant, stabilization of disease activity are evident. EDSS scores improved with 10%, MSSS scores with 37%, MSIS-29 physical/psychological scores with 12% and 15%, respectively, and SDMT scores with 23% (mean values at 5 years of treatment compared to baseline values).</p><p>Serious AEs were rare (2.3%, 54 events), but included 7 non-fatal cases and 1 fatal case of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML, 0.3%), with the latest case reported 2012-10-31. The proportion of JCV+ patients has been reduced over the last years as a result of JCV testing. This has reduced the rate of PML cases per patient years. A total of 11 patients (0.5%) have died for any reason.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> SMSreg proves to function well as a post-marketing drug surveillance platform, providing long-term data regarding drug effects and AEs. NTZ is generally well tolerated with sustained efficacy, though the risk of PML is an important concern.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="section450-1352458514546077"><title>Diagnosis and differential diagnosis</title><sec id="section451-1352458514546077"><title>P222</title><sec id="section452-1352458514546077"><title>Transverse myelitis in neuro-Behcet&#x02019;s disease</title><p><underline>HS Lee</underline><sup>1</sup>, HY Shin<sup>1</sup>, BC Suh<sup>2</sup>, SW Kim<sup>3</sup>, SM Kim<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Yonsei University College of Medicine, Neurology, Seoul, Korea, Republic of, <sup>2</sup>Kangbuk Samsung Hospital, Neurology, Seoul, Korea, Republic of, <sup>3</sup>Catholic University of Korea, Neurology, Seoul, Korea, Republic of</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Transverse myelitis (TM) can appear as the first manifestation in conditions such as multiple sclerosis (MS) and neuromyelitis optica (NMO). However a number of disorders including Behcet&#x02019;s disease (BD) may also cause TM. TM in Behcet&#x02019;s disease is rare and little is known about this. There are only a handful of case reports or series about this disorder.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To describe the clinical and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) characteristics of TM in BD.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> From Jan 1984 to July 2012, there were 109 patients with BD who had neurological involvement. 60 (55.04 %) patients had parenchymal CNS involvement. TM was developed in 7 patients among 60 patients with parenchymal CNS involvement. The medical records and MRI of the 7 patients were reviewed retrospectively. All 7 patients fulfiled the diagnositic criteria for BD established by the International Study Group for Behcet&#x02019;s disease.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> TM was developed in 7 patients with BD. Four patients were male and three were women. The median age at onset of BD and TM was 29 year-old (range, 18 to 37 years) and 31 (range, 22 to 37 years) respectively. Two of 7 patients combined with brain stem lesion at the initial presentation of TM. Six patients were treated with corticosteroid. Among six patients treated with corticosteroid, four patients showed improvement after treatment. Other two had no response of the treatment and could not walk independently at the last visit. The median follow-up period was 8 years (range 5-23). Three of all seven patients had relapses. Two patients had one relapse as TM again and the other patient recurred twice (TM and rhombencephalitis). MRI showed confluent T2-weighted hyperintense lesions of the spinal cord in all seven patients. The median lengths of lesions were 7 vertebral bodies (range 1-15). In five patients, the involvement segment of spinal cord was longer than three vertebral bodies, i.e. longitudinal extensive transverse myelitis (LETM).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> TM can be developed in patients with BD. LETM may be a relatively common and characteristic manifestation of TM in patients with neuro-Behcet&#x02019;s disease. Neuro-behcet&#x02019; disease should be considered as a differential diagnosis of TM, especially in patients with LETM.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section453-1352458514546077"><title>P223</title><sec id="section454-1352458514546077"><title>Methionyl-tRNA formyltransferase (MTFMT) deficiency mimicking neuromyelitis optica</title><p><underline>JA Pena</underline><sup>1,2</sup>, F Scaglia<sup>3</sup>, TE Lotze<sup>1,2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Baylor College of Medicine, Pediatric Neurology, Houston, TX, United States, <sup>2</sup>Texas Children Hospital, Pediatric Neurology, Houston, TX, United States, <sup>3</sup>Baylor College of Medicine, Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Houston, TX, United States</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Neuromyelitis optica (NMO) is typified by optic neuritis and transverse myelitis, often with longitudinally extensive cord lesions.

NMO was initially considered due to gadolinium enhancement of long spinal cord lesions as well as white matter lesions in regions of high aquaporin expression to include the diencephalon and brainstem. In addition, there was clinical and radiographic improvement following treatment with corticosteroids and plasmapheresis. However, serum and CSF aquaporin antibodies were negative, and CSF lactate levels were persistently elevated.

Further investigations to include CSF lactate as well as related metabolic and genetic studies are appropriate in suspected NMO patients who are seronegative for aquaporin-4 antibodies. Whole exome sequencing can provide a cost effective method for discovering rare underlying genetic disorders that may mimic an acquired demyelinating syndrome.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section455-1352458514546077"><title>P224</title><sec id="section456-1352458514546077"><title>Characteristic retinal pathology in Susac syndrome detected by spectral domain optical coherence tomography differentiates from multiple sclerosis</title><p><underline>M Ringelstein</underline><sup>1</sup>, P Albrecht<sup>1</sup>, I Kleffner<sup>2</sup>, J Harmel<sup>1</sup>, B B&#x000fc;hn<sup>1</sup>, A-K M&#x000fc;ller<sup>1</sup>, D Finis<sup>3</sup>, R Guthoff<sup>3</sup>, R Bergholz<sup>4</sup>, M Kr&#x000e4;mer<sup>5</sup>, F Paul<sup>6</sup>, A Brandt<sup>6</sup>, S Jarius<sup>7</sup>, B Wildemann<sup>7</sup>, H-P Hartung<sup>1</sup>, J D&#x000f6;rr<sup>6</sup>, O Aktas<sup>1</sup>, European Susac Consortium (EUSAC)</p><p><sup>1</sup>Heinrich-Heine University, Medical Faculty, Neurology, D&#x000fc;sseldorf, Germany, <sup>2</sup>University Hospital M&#x000fc;nster, Neurology, M&#x000fc;nster, Germany, <sup>3</sup>Heinrich-Heine University, Medical Faculty, Ophthalmology, D&#x000fc;sseldorf, Germany, <sup>4</sup>Charit&#x000e9; - Universit&#x000e4;tsmedizin Berlin, Ophthalmology, Berlin, Germany, <sup>5</sup>Alfried Krupp Hospital, Neurology, Essen, Germany, <sup>6</sup>Charit&#x000e9; - Universit&#x000e4;tsmedizin Berlin, NeuroCure Clinical Research Center, Berlin, Germany, <sup>7</sup>University Hospital Heidelberg, Neurology, Devision of Molecular Neuroimmunology, Heidelberg, Germany</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Susac syndrome (SuS) is a rare, presumably autoimmune-mediated vasculopathy, leading to microvessel occlusions in the brain, inner ear, and retina. The characteristic clinical triad consists of encephalopathy, sensorineural hearing deficits, and visual disturbances due to branch retinal artery occlusion (BRAO) detectable by fluorescein angiography (FA). Differentiation from Multiple Sclerosis (MS) can be challenging, since clinical and diagnostic findings may overlap.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> Evaluation of retinal layer pathology considering angiographic results in order to differentiate SuS from MS and healthy controls (HC).</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) with last generation automated segmentation procedures the total macular volume (TMV) and the mean peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (pRNFL), as well as the RNFL, ganglion cell layer (GCL), inner plexiform layer (IPL), inner nuclear layer (INL), outer plexiform layer (OPL), and outer nuclear layer (ONL) of the whole macula were studied in 17 SuS patients and compared to each 17 age- and sex-matched relapsing remitting MS patients and HC. Statistical comparisons of the retinal parameters between groups were performed using generalized estimation equations correcting for within subject inter eye correlations and adjusting for age and sex.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The pRNFL of our SuS patients was significantly reduced (p&#x0003c; 0.001) compared to MS patients and HC, while the TMV only differed significantly to HC (p&#x0003c; 0.001). The retinae of our SuS patients showed mainly peripherally scattered areas with severe pathology, in which the RNFL (p&#x0003c; 0.001), GCL (p&#x0003c; 0.001), IPL (p&#x0003c; 0.001), INL (p&#x0003c; 0.001), and OPL (p&#x0003c; 0.001), but not the ONL were significantly reduced compared to corresponding sectors in MS patients and HC. In retinal sectors without obvious pathology only the IPL was significantly reduced compared to HC and MS patients (p&#x0003c; 0.001 and p=0.008, respectively). Retinal OCT pathologies partly corresponded to angiographically proven BRAOs in our SuS patients.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> In contrast to MS severe scattered inner retinal layer abnormalities in SuS patients sparing the ONL are detectable by SD-OCT, highlighting the retinal vascular pathogenesis of the disease. Interestingly, we observed alterations of the IPL in our SuS patients even in areas without obvious pathology possibly corresponding to a secondary pathology. SD-OCT represents a safe, non-invasive diagnostic tool for differentiating SuS from MS.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section457-1352458514546077"><title>P225</title><sec id="section458-1352458514546077"><title>Brain lesion location at onset helps differentiate neuromyelitis optica and multiple sclerosis</title><p><underline>NH Kim</underline><sup>1</sup>, DE Kim<sup>1</sup>, SH Woo<sup>1</sup>, KH Lee<sup>2</sup>, HJ Kim<sup>3</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Dongguk University Ilsan Hospital, Neurology, Goyang-si, Korea, Republic of, <sup>2</sup>Sungkyunkwan University Samsung Seoul Hospital, Neurology, Seoul, Korea, Republic of, <sup>3</sup>National Cancer Center, Neurology, Goyang-si, Korea, Republic of</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Neuromyelitis optica (NMO) is an inflammatory demyelinating condition of central nervous system mediated by antibodies to aquaporin-4 water channel. Making diagnosis of antibody-negative neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) is difficult because the more prevalent multiple sclerosis (MS) can present similarly. It is important to distinguish these two conditions because NMO needs long-term immunosuppression to prevent devastating relapses and beta-interferon for MS can worsen NMO. Hence we need other markers to help identify NMOSD and MS. Furthermore, in patients with history of multiple episodes, the discrimination using brain lesion is not easy because the cumulative multiple lesions from each episode can overwhelm and make obscure disease specific brain lesion distribution. So there is a need to evaluate brain lesion distributions of early phase to differentiate these two conditions.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> The objective of this study was to investigate disease specific locations in NMO and MS and to discriminate the diseases in early phase.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> We compared brain lesion locations and frequencies in MS and NMO with brain MRI at onset. In this multicenter, retrospective study, clinical and magnetic resonance image (MRI) data at onset were collected for 93 seropositive NMO (or NMOSD) and 89 MS patients with brain involvement. By assessing brain lesions on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) MRI, we generated lesion probability maps (LPMs) of brain lesions and frequency. Voxel-wise analaysis for comparing of LPMs were performed with a nonparametric permutation-based approach (p&#x0003c; 0.05).</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Patients with NMO showed lesion frequency in brainstem, pericallosal area, and corticospinal tract. Patients with MS had lesion frequency in several clusters of periventricular white mater and inferior temporal lobes. The voxel-wise analysis demonstrated NMO patients were significantly more likely to have lesions adjacent to fourth ventricle, involving corticospinal tract including midbrain cerebral peduncle and internal capsule, in optic radiation, and in pericallosal area than MS patients, while MS patients were significantly more likely to have lesions adjacent to posterior and temporal horn than NMO patients.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> This work demonstrated disease specific brain lesion locations suggesting that focal pathology affects different regions in NMO and MS. Careful inspection of brain lesion distributions on MRI can help distinguish MS and NMO in early phase.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section459-1352458514546077"><title>P226</title><sec id="section460-1352458514546077"><title>Application of the 2010 McDonald criteria to a cohort of patients with clinically isolated spinal cord syndrome</title><p><underline>A Vandendriessche</underline><sup>1</sup>, H Z&#x000e9;phir<sup>2</sup>, O Outerrick<sup>2</sup>, D Fetter<sup>3</sup>, N Derache<sup>4</sup>, G Defer<sup>4</sup>, P Vermersch<sup>2</sup>, J De S&#x000e8;ze<sup>5</sup>, B Bourre<sup>3</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>CHU Rouen, Neurologie, Rouen, France, <sup>2</sup>CHRU Lille, Lille, France, <sup>3</sup>CHU Rouen, Rouen, France, <sup>4</sup>CHU Caen, Caen, France, <sup>5</sup>CHU Strasbourg, Strasbourg, France</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Recently, the International Panel on Diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) has proposed new Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) criteria for the diagnosis of MS in patients with Clinically Isolated Syndrome (CIS).

After a mean follow-up of 7.9 years, 68 (53.5%) patients converted to MS. The sensitivity of the DIS 2010 criteria was 60.3% and the specificity 83.1%. The sensitivity of the DIT 2010 criteria was 27.9% and the specificity was 83.1%. All patients fulfilling the 2010 McDonald criteria had positive CSF (elevated IgG index or oligoclonal bands) while 29 (22.8%) had positive CSF without fulfilling neither 2005 nor 2010 McDonald criteria.

If changing the DIT criteria, including the symptomatic gadolinium-enhancing lesions, the sensitivity increased to 55.9% while maintaining a specificity of 81.4%. This definifion of DIT could consider the particular feature of SC-CIS.

Patients fulfilling at least 1 criterion formed the combined AMS (C-AMS) cohort and those not satisfying any criteria formed the non-AMS (N-AMS) cohort. C-AMS and N-AMS were compared using multivariable logistic regression for baseline characteristics and Kaplan Meier survival analysis for age at mortality and time to EDSS 6 and 8 from symptom onset. For C-AMS, predictors of death and progression were analyzed using multivariable cox regression.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Out of 1036 consecutive MS patients (males-34.5%, primary progressive (PP)-20.8%), A1 identified 172 (16.6%) patients (males-43.0%, PPMS-43.6%), A2 identified 283 (27.3%) patients (males-38.9%, PPMS-19.8%) and A3 identified 109 (10.5%) patients (males-44%).

The pathogenesis of these bizarre and sometimes tumefactive lesions has remained puzzling, but hypoxia-like tissue injury has been hypothesized to contribute to their development.</p><p>MS brain lesions and their correlation to the cerebral vasculature can be visualized with very high anatomical details at 7 Tesla MRI (7T).</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To describe lesion morphology and vascular structures of Bal&#x000f3;&#x02019;s concentric sclerosis at 7T in comparison to classical MS.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Four Bal&#x000f3;&#x02019;s concentric sclerosis patients (age 23-45; three with a monophasic disease course, one with three relapses; one male; EDSS median 2.0) underwent 7T MRI. The imaging protocol included 2D highly resolving T2* weighted (T2*w) MRI (in-plane resolution 200&#x000b5;m x 200&#x000b5;m) and susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI, in-plane resolution 0.5mm x 0.5mm). Eight MS patients with relapsing-remitting disease course served as controls. We analyzed the lesion number, size and morphology with central vein and hypointense rim count on T2*w sequences, taking the SWI image as reference for detecting venous structures.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> In total, we detected 22 lesions in Bal&#x000f3; patients (n=4), and 476 lesions in classical MS (n=8). Lesion morphology was concealed in one Bal&#x000f3; patient due to damage caused by prior surgical resection. The other Bal&#x000f3;&#x02019;s cases expressed at least one characteristically layered lesion. A central intralesional vein was clearly depicted within the inner layer in two Bal&#x000f3; patients; in the third Bal&#x000f3; patient&#x02019;s lesion, a central intralesional blood vessel was only faintly visible. A strong T2* hypointense rim was detectable at the edge of all layered Bal&#x000f3;&#x02019;s lesions. When looking at other white matter lesions (n=18) in Bal&#x000f3; patients, we observed a morphology and distribution of lesions comparable to our MS control cohort (hypointense rim count n=5, perivascular lesions count n=17, periventricular lesions n=8).

In some cases, the diagnosis can only be made by pathological analysis, despite the risks of surgical complications and sequelae.Antibody against AQP4 is an important diagnostic biomarker of NMOSD, though no assay is 100% sensitive and the test availability is limited in some regions. In fact, the AQP4-antibody positivity is crucial since immunosuppressive therapy is effective to reduce further attacks in NMOSD. If untreated, NMOSD carries a poor prognosis and thus its early diagnosis is warranted.Here we report the clinical, imaging and pathological features of two patients of AQP4-antibody-positive LETM, who initially underwent spinal cord biopsy due to suspected tumors.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To consider clinical, MRI and neuropathological clues to the diagnosis of NMOSD in two cases of AQP4 antibody positive LETM initially biopsied due to suspected spinal cord tumors.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Two case reports with neuropathological analysis of biopsied tissues.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Observations: We report 2 female patients (age 14 and 47) with acute severe transverse myelopathy. Spinal cord MRI showed T2-hyperintense longitudinally extensive lesions with swelling and contrast enhancement. The spinal cord biopsy excluded tumors, but no definitive diagnosis was made. Later, both patients were diagnosed as NMOSD because AQP4-antibody was positive. Pathological re-evaluation of the biopsied materials revealed that both cases had demyelinated lesions with thickened vessel walls and tissue rarefactions . The immunohistochemical staining showed findings compatible with acute NMOSD lesions such as astrocyte loss in the lesion center and the lack of AQP4 staining with relatively preserved myelinated fibers in one case. The other case had findings of reactive astrogliosis with partially lacked AQP4, which is consistent with chronic NMOSD lesions.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Now we do not have to perform spinal cord biopsy to diagnose NMOSD without the diagnostic serum test of AQP4 antibody, we may encounter to such materials due to the investigation of spinal tumors.</p><p>NMOSD can be suspected in the biopsied material if some features such as cystic changes with vascular wall thickening and signs of astrocyte rarefaction are present.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section467-1352458514546077"><title>P230</title><sec id="section468-1352458514546077"><title>Artificial intelligence techniques in the diagnosis of clinically definite multiple sclerosis</title><p><underline>G Dalla Costa</underline><sup>1</sup>, L Moiola<sup>1</sup>, L Leocani<sup>2</sup>, R Furlan<sup>3</sup>, M Filippi<sup>4</sup>, G Comi<sup>1</sup>, V Martinelli<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>San Raffaele Hospital, Neurological Department, Milan, Italy, <sup>2</sup>San Raffaele Hospital, Neurophysiology Unit, Milan, Italy, <sup>3</sup>San Raffaele Hospital, Neuroimmunology Research Unit, Milan, Italy, <sup>4</sup>San Raffaele Hospital, Neuroimaging Research Unit, Milan, Italy</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> The early identification of patients at risk of developing clinically definite multiple sclerosis (CDMS) represents the main purpose of diagnostic criteria and of clinicians in everyday clinical practice.</p><p>The integration of all risk factors observed at clinical presentation into an estimate of absolute risk should be therefore the starting point for an accurate and personalized risk management at the onset of the disease.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> The aim of the current study is to develop an artificial neural networks-based (ANNs) diagnostic model integrating both clinical and paraclinical baseline data.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Patients admitted to our Department within 3 months from the onset of a clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) have been included.

In support of this is the observation that the rare mitochondrial disease Leber&#x02019;s hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) and an MS-like illness (LHON-MS) coexist more frequently than would be expected by chance<sup>3, <sup>4</sup></sup>. The MRI brain appearances of MS are characteristic, and therefore if LHON-MS has common imaging features with MS it would lend weight to the idea that they are the same entity and therefore share a disease mechanism.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> The primary objective of our study was to compare the MRI features of MS, LHON and LHON-MS. A secondary aim was to observe the effect of female gender on the presence of white matter lesions in our cohort.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> A blinded standardised study of MRI brain scans was conducted by three reviewers with expert experience in MS and MRI. There were 30 with MS, 31 with LHON (without an MS-like illness) and 12 with LHON-MS.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> All 12 patients with LHON-MS had an MRI scan rated as typical of MS by the expert reviewers. Two patients (6.5%) with LHON had an MRI scan consistent with MS, and six further patients (19.4%) had non-specific white matter lesions. The lesion morphology and location in MS and LHON-MS were very similar, and brain atrophy and T1 hypointensity were noted in both conditions. There was a high level of inter-rater agreement between the reviewers (94%, kappa = 0.88, p &#x0003c; 0.001).</p><p>Of the 12 females in total with LHON, eight had LHON-MS and three had asymptomatic T2 hyperintense white matter lesions. Ten of 12 females with LHON were rated as having brain lesions consistent with MS, compared to three of 30 males, equating to a relative risk of 8.3 (95% CI 2.8 to 25.1, p&#x0003c; 0.01).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The MRI brain features of MS and LHON-MS are indistinguishable to the expert eye providing evidence that these diseases are the same. Therefore they may share a common pathological mechanism, and further work into the role of mitochondrial dysfunction in the evolution of MS lesions should be encouraged. Future research should also explore the apparent synergistic effect of female gender and LHON on the risk of developing MS.</p><p><bold>References:</bold></p><list list-type="order" id="list16-1352458514546077"><list-item><p>Mahad, D., et al., Brain, 2008. 131(Pt 7): p. 1722-35.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Dutta, R., et al., Ann Neurol, 2006. 59(3): p. 478-89.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Riordan-Eva, P., et al., Brain, 1995. 118 ( Pt 2): p. 319-37.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Vanopdenbosch, L., et al., J Neurol, 2000. 247(7): p. 535-43.</p></list-item></list></sec></sec><sec id="section471-1352458514546077"><title>P232</title><sec id="section472-1352458514546077"><title>Diagnosing multiple sclerosis with a gait measuring system, an analysis of the motor fatigue, and machine learning</title><p><underline>S Pi&#x000e9;rard</underline><sup>1</sup>, S Azrour<sup>1</sup>, R Phan-Ba<sup>2</sup>, V Delvaux<sup>3</sup>, P Maquet<sup>3</sup>, M Van Droogenbroeck<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>University of Li&#x000e8;ge, INTELSIG, Li&#x000e8;ge, Belgium, <sup>2</sup>University of Li&#x000e8;ge, Li&#x000e8;ge, Belgium, <sup>3</sup>University Hospital of Li&#x000e8;ge, Neurology, Li&#x000e8;ge, Belgium</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Walking impairment is frequent and appears early in the disease course of MS Patients (MSP). Last year, a new gait measuring system well suited for the clinical routine (GAIMS) has been introduced [Pierard ECTRIMS 2013]. The measures can be used to compute Gait Descriptors (GDs) averaging the gait characteristics, either over the total recorded test, or over any part of it. This allows to analyze the evolution of the gait over time, which is related to the motor fatigue. In [PhanBa PLoS ONE 7(4)], a statistical difference between MSP and Healthy People (HP) has been found on the walking speed evolution during a 500m walk test, but the corresponding discrimination power has not yet been investigated. Moreover, GAIMS provides more GDs, which opens new prospects.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To show that the motor fatigue, given by the evolution of the gait characteristics measured by GAIMS during a single 500m walk test, can be used to discriminate MSP and HP.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> 115 HP and 59 MSP (median EDSS 3.26) walked 500m (25 laps of an 8-shaped path) as fast as possible, and their gait was recorded with GAIMS. The measures taken over the total path, and 50 consecutive windows of 10m, have been analyzed. This led to 26 GDs for the total path, and for each window. A machine learning algorithm, named ExtRaTrees [Geurts Machine Learning 63(1)], was used to predict if the observed person is a MSP or a HP. We tried to feed it with two sets of values. The first set gathers the GDs computed on the total path while the second one is populated with the subtractions between the GDs computed on each window and the GDs computed on the first, the middle and the last window. In this way, the second set of values only takes into account the evolution of the GDs which is related to the motor fatigue.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The results are obtained by leave-one-person-out: the class (HP or MSP) of each person is predicted using a model learned only from the data related to the other people. We obtained a maximum balanced accuracy (<italic>ie</italic> the arithmetic mean of the sensitivity and the specificity) on predictions of 89.8% and 82% respectively for the first and the second set of values.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Although the temporal evolution of the gait characteristics has a lower discrimination power than GDs averaged over the total test, the score obtained with the second set of values (82%) implies that the evolution of the gait characteristics, which is related to the motor fatigue, contains some useful information that can be taken into account for diagnosing MS.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section473-1352458514546077"><title>P233</title><sec id="section474-1352458514546077"><title>The diagnosis of multiple sclerosis: pinpointing the concept of &#x0201c;no better explanation&#x0201d;</title><p><underline>M Calabrese</underline><sup>1</sup>, C Gasperini<sup>2</sup>, C Tortorella<sup>3</sup>, S Malucchi<sup>4</sup>, P Ragonese<sup>5</sup>, G De Luca<sup>6</sup>, R Fantozzi<sup>7</sup>, S Lo Fermo<sup>8</sup>, L Boffa<sup>9</sup>, D Paolicelli<sup>10</sup>, A Gajofatto<sup>1</sup>, I Pesci<sup>11</sup>, P Annovazzi<sup>12</sup>, C Cordioli<sup>13</sup>, R Lanzillo<sup>14</sup>, A Giorgio<sup>15</sup>, A Gallo<sup>16</sup>, E Cocco<sup>17</sup>, V Tomassini<sup>18</sup>, G Frisullo<sup>19</sup>, L Prosperini<sup>20</sup>, ME Rodegher<sup>21</sup>, C Solaro<sup>22</sup>, The RIREMS Group (Rising Italian Researchers in Multiple Sclerosis)</p><p><sup>1</sup>University Hospital of Verona, Dept. of Neurological and Movement Sciences, Verona, Italy, <sup>2</sup>San Camillo Hospital, Rome, Italy, <sup>3</sup>University of Bari, Bari, Italy, <sup>4</sup>Neurologia 2-CRESM, AOU San Luigi Gonzaga, Orbassano, Italy, <sup>5</sup>University of Palermo, Dept. of Experimental Medicine and Clinical Neurosciences, Palermo, Italy, <sup>6</sup>Ospedale SS Annunziata, Chieti, Italy, <sup>7</sup>Istituto Neurologico Mediterraneo, Pozzilli, Italy, <sup>8</sup>A.O.U.

During one year, patients affected by progressive paraparesis were screened for HTLV-1 infection. Diagnosis was done by ELISA and confirmed by western blot in both blood and CSF. Proviral load in peripheral blood mononuclear cells was measured.

Patients performed brain and spinal cord MRI, and somatosensory evoked potentials.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> 246 patients affected by paraparesis were screened. Forty patients (65% females; mean age 49.8 years) were diagnosed as having HAM/TSP. Most patients presented with progressive spastic paraparesis and bladder dysfunction. Mean time since onset was 11.2 years. On neurological exam, lower limb briskly reflexes, bilateral ankle clonus and upgoing plantar responses (97.7%), lower limb sensory disturbance (80%), lower limb proximal muscle atrophy (28.6%), and cerebellar dysfunction (21.4%) were detected. Mean EDSS score was 6, and mean Barthel index was 65. Fifty percent of patients were wheel-chair restricted or had a domiciliary walk. Proviral load ranged between 198 and 24,464 copies.

These lesions differ from typical demyelinating lesions as they are greater than 2 cm in size, may display edema and mass effect, and often mimic tumors or abscesses. Clinical and radiologic features are different than in typical multiple sclerosis (MS), leading to difficulty in diagnosis and treatment.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To describe the demographic and clinical features of individuals with TDLs to determine the course of disease, disability and the proportion with prior diagnosis of or subsequent development of MS. We also examine clinical and radiologic responses to treatment.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> A retrospective observational multi-center study of 16 individuals [81% female; mean age 43.6 years] with TDLs in Toronto between 1999-2014. Data included demographic features, clinical course, disability (Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS)), radiologic features and treatment response.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The mean age at TDL onset was 40.2 years and 75% had polysymptomatic onset with a mean EDSS of 5. The TDL was the first demyelinating event in 12 (75%), and 50% of these individuals were subsequently diagnosed with MS while the others remained clinically isolated syndrome. Three patients (18.8%) had recurrent TDL episodes. On imaging, most lesions enhanced (95%; 72% ring enhancing) and the maximum size ranged from 2 to 7.2 cm. At onset, MRI met McDonald criteria for dissemination in space in 50%. Most TDLs (90%) were treated initially with high-dose steroids and 70% improved. Five were treated with plasmapheresis and three with cyclophosphamide induction due to poor clinical and radiologic response to steroids. Two patients improved spontaneously without treatment. At mean follow up of 26 months, 10 (50%) TDL episodes had partial and 9 (45%) complete recovery, while one had not recovered (2 months after onset). Mean EDSS at follow up was 2. Radiologically, 95% of lesions decreased in size and 76% had complete resolution of enhancement. Pathology was available to confirm the diagnosis in 4 lesions (20%).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Individuals with TDLs remain a diagnostic challenge given atypical clinical and radiologic features with a range of presentations, but not all patients require biopsy. Treatment response is generally good. Many patients go on to develop more typical relapsing-remitting MS, but a subset has recurrent TDLs.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="section491-1352458514546077"><title>Disease biomarkers</title><sec id="section492-1352458514546077"><title>P242</title><sec id="section493-1352458514546077"><title>Glial and neuronal markers in CSF predict progression in multiple sclerosis</title><p><underline>MA Ma&#x000f1;&#x000e9; Martinez</underline><sup>1,2</sup>, B Olsson<sup>3</sup>, L Bau<sup>2</sup>, E Matas<sup>2</sup>, A Cobo Calvo<sup>2</sup>, U Andreasson<sup>3</sup>, K Blennow<sup>3</sup>, L Romero-Pinel<sup>2</sup>, S Mart&#x000ed;nez-Y&#x000e9;lamos<sup>2</sup>, H Zetterberg<sup>3,4</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Department of Neurlogy, Joan XXIII University Hospital, Universitat Rovira i Virgili, Tarragona, Spain, <sup>2</sup>Multiple Sclerosis Unit, Department of Neurology, Bellvitge University Hospital, Universitat de Barcelona, L&#x02019;Hospitalet de Llobregat, Spain, <sup>3</sup>Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, Department of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry, M&#x000f6;lndal, Sweden, <sup>4</sup>Institute of Neurology, University College London, London, United Kingdom</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Several CSF biomarkers have been suggested as prognostic markers in Multiple Sclerosis (MS).

The PR had clinical (relapses and/or increased disability) and/or MRI activity on IFN therapy while GR patients were stable. Whole cell protein and total RNA were prepared from peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL). Dicer expression was analyzed by RT-qPCR and quantitative immunoblotting. True-seq small RNA libraries were sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform. Counts were normalized and examined for differential expression with miRanalyzer and edgeR software.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> 100 subjects were enrolled; average EDSS: 2.26 in GR, 3.30 in RRMS PR, 6.20 in SPMS PR, 3.03 in RRMS NT and 4.70 in SPMS NT. Decreased Dicer protein levels were found - 14.8, 11.2, 2.6 - in HC, RRMS NT and SPMS NT respectively. 48hrs after an Avonex dose, only Good Responders showed a significant enhancement in Dicer mRNA levels (2.3-fold: p=0.0013). Dicer protein levels appeared to increase in RRMS GR and possibly in SPMS PR (RRMS PR did not show any change) but levels did not achieve statistical significance.</p><p>Of ~600 miRNA identified in each group, several miRs appear to discriminate between RRMS and SPMS. miR-484 &#x00026; miR-99a-5p show significantly decreased expression in SPMS NT patients and miR-107 with enhanced expression. Neither miR-342-3p nor miR-146b-5p was differentially expressed between healthy controls and RRMS patients; however, both were significantly decreased in SPMS.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The alterations in Dicer mRNA, protein and miRNA expression in MS and the restriction of specific responses to diagnostic subsets of patients suggests that Dicer and miRNA regulation may play a mechanistic role in MS. The identification of alterations in Dicer expression as well as restricted miRNA expression changes offer potential as diagnostic and prognostic markers.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section496-1352458514546077"><title>P244</title><sec id="section497-1352458514546077"><title>Interferon inducible transcriptional profile in secondary progressive multiple sclerosis patients</title><p><underline>M Gurevich</underline><sup>1</sup>, G Miron<sup>1</sup>, E Hanael<sup>1</sup>, P Sonis<sup>1</sup>, M Dolev<sup>1</sup>, D Magalashvili<sup>1</sup>, A Achiron<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Sheba Medical Center, Multiple Sclerosis Center, Ramat Gan, Israel</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Interferon-beta is the recommended immunomodulatory treatment for the treatment of secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS) patients. Interferon inducible transcriptional signatures have been well characterized in relapsing remitting (RRMS) patients, however, information is sparse regarding gene expression profiles of interferon-treated SPMS patients. It is of importance to identify biomarkers that will characterize beneficial treatment response to interferon beta in SPMS patients.

All treated patients received Interferon beta 1a (Rebif, Merck Serono) for at least 12 months. First, interferon inducible gene expression profile was determined by finding differentially expressed genes between RRMS treated and untreated patients (p value &#x0003c; 0.01 after False Discovery Rate (FDR)). Next, unsupervised hierarchal clustering of SPMS patients was done based on the RRMS interferon inducible gene expression profile.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Interferon induced transcriptional signature of Rebif treated RRMS patients included 101 differentially expressed genes.

Hierarchical clustering of SPMS patients based on this interferon inducible signature resulted in 2 main clusters correlating with treatment status. 55% (11/20) SPMS patients had interferon induced signature and 9/20 SPMS patients, despite receiving treatment, were clustered together with untreated patients as they lacked an interferon induced signature.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Expression of interferon inducible genes may serve as biomarkers for selecting appropriate SPMS patients for treatment.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section498-1352458514546077"><title>P245</title><sec id="section499-1352458514546077"><title>Serum neurofilament light chain levels are increased in patients with a clinically isolated syndrome</title><p>G Disanto<sup>1</sup>, R Adiutori<sup>1</sup>, R Dobson<sup>1</sup>, V Martinelli<sup>2</sup>, G Dalla Costa<sup>2</sup>, T Runia<sup>3</sup>, E Evdoshenko<sup>4</sup>, E Thouvenot<sup>5</sup>, M Trojano<sup>6</sup>, N Norgren<sup>7</sup>, J Lorscheider<sup>8</sup>, C Teunissen<sup>9</sup>, L Kappos<sup>8</sup>, G Giovannoni<sup>1</sup>, <underline>J Kuhle</underline><sup>1,8</sup>, on behalf of the &#x02018;International Clinically Isolated Syndrome Consortium (iCIS)&#x02019;</p><p><sup>1</sup>Queen Mary University, London, United Kingdom, <sup>2</sup>Vita-Salute San Raffaele University, Milan, Italy, <sup>3</sup>Erasmus MC University Medical Center, Rotterdam, Netherlands, <sup>4</sup>City Clinical Hospital # 31, St Petersburg, Russian Federation, <sup>5</sup>Universit&#x000e9; Montpellier 1, Montpellier, France, <sup>6</sup>University of Bari, Bari, Italy, <sup>7</sup>Uman Diagnostics, Umea, Sweden, <sup>8</sup>University Hospital, Basel, Switzerland, <sup>9</sup>VU University Medical Centre, Amsterdam, Netherlands</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Neurofilaments (Nf) are highly specific structural elements of neurons.

The median follow-up was 4.3 years (IQR=2.9-6.4), during which 623 patients (59.5%) converted to CDMS. We selected 100 patients with the shortest time of conversion to CDMS (fast converters (FC), median (interquartile range, IQR) conversion time: 110 days (73-139)) and 100 with the longest follow-up time in the absence of conversion (non-converters (NC), follow-up: 6.5 years (5.3-7.9)). Serum NfL concentration in these CIS samples and 92 British healthy controls (HC) were measured using our previously validated electrochemiluminescence immunoassay.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> NfL levels were higher in FC (median 24.1 pg/ml (IQR 13.5-51.8), odds ratio (OR)=5.9, 95%CI=2.6-13.0, p=1.5x10<sup>-5</sup>) and NC (19.3 pg/ml (13.6-35.2), OR=7.0, 95%CI=2.9-17.3, p=2.3x10<sup>-5</sup>) than in HC (7.9 pg/ml (5.6-17.2)). However, NfL levels were not associated with fast conversion (OR=1.4, 95%CI=0.7-2.7, p=0.37). Serum NfL concentration was positively associated with presence of gadolinium enhancing lesions (OR=2.7; 95%CI=1.1-6.4; p=0.026), larger T2 lesion load (OR=2.36; 95%CI=1.21-4.59; p=0.011), higher EDSS at baseline (OR=2.5; 95%CI=1.2-5.3; p=0.013), but not with the presence of oligoclonal bands in the CSF (OR=1.7; 95%CI=0.8-3.7; p=0.214).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Median serum NfL levels are abnormally high in CIS patients compared to healthy individuals, correlate with concurrent inflammatory MRI activity and disability and therefore represent a promising and easily accessible biomarker that deserves further exploration.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section500-1352458514546077"><title>P246</title><sec id="section501-1352458514546077"><title>Gray matter related proteins in cerebrospinal fluid differentiate between multiple sclerosis and other acquired demyelinating syndromes in childhood</title><p>V Singh<sup>1</sup>, <underline>D van Pelt</underline><sup>1</sup>, M Stoop<sup>1</sup>, C Stingl<sup>1</sup>, I Ketelslegers<sup>1</sup>, R Neuteboom<sup>1</sup>, T Luider<sup>1</sup>, R Hintzen<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, Netherlands</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> A few percent of all multiple sclerosis (MS) patients experience a first attack in childhood.

In this way, 88 peptides were signi&#x0fb01;cantly differentially abundant between children with MS and monophasic ADS (at p&#x0003c; 0.01 two or more peptides identified). Peptides with increased abundance in MS were 53 that corresponded with 14 proteins, of which 12 linked to neuronal functions and structures such as synapse, axon, extracellular matrix proteases (for example Amyloid-like protein 2, Neurofascin, Carboxypeptidase E, Brevican, Contactin-2). Two of 14 were related to immune function. Thirty-five peptides were with decreased abundance in MS, which corresponded to 7 proteins. From these seven, five were linked specifically with the innate immune system (Haptoglobin, C4b-binding protein alpha chain) and Monocyte differentiation (antigen CD14) and the two other relate to inflammation.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> monophasic ADS can be differentiated from MS in children primarily by gray matter proteins and immune related proteins.

The metabolic changes identified in MS could provide insight into pathogenesis of the disease, as well as enable the discovery of new biomarkers of disease progression and response to therapy.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To examine the metabolic profile of subjects with MS and to compare this with healthy controls.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Plasma from 25 MS patients and 15 healthy controls was subjected to metabolic extraction using 1:2:0.8 of chloroform, methanol, and water buffer to generate aqueous, organic, and protein fractions. Normalization with protein concentration fraction was followed by data acquisition using the Agilent 6540 Quadrupole-Time-of-Flight (Q-TOF) mass spectrometer-Agilent 1290 HPLC. Data were then analyzed using Agilent Mass Hunter and Agilent Mass Profiler Professional and Qual software to determine the metabolic profile of each group. Samples were grouped according to disease status and differences in metabolite abundance between these groups. Statistical significance was determined using an unpaired t-test with a corrected Benjamini-Hochberg threshold of p=0.05. Furthermore, metabolic pathways were reconstructed and explored from metabolic data to identify pathway abnormalities.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> 2864 metabolites were identified in the negative aqueous layer, of which 84 showed differential regulation in MS subjects as compared to controls. Principal components analysis and unsupervised clustering demonstrated strong separation between MS and healthy controls. Among the metabolic pathways found to be altered, tryptophan metabolism and the tricarboxylic acid cycle stood out most profoundly. Metabolites in these pathways were significantly different between MS and control samples. Further pathway analysis and metabolite identification is being performed.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Comparative global metabolic profiling revealed a distinct metabolic profile of MS as compared to healthy controls. This could serve as an important tool for biomarker discovery and provide new insights into the pathogenesis of the disease.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section504-1352458514546077"><title>P248</title><sec id="section505-1352458514546077"><title>CSF biomarkers of inflammation and neuronal damage in acute optic neuritis predict later development of MS and long-term disability</title><p><underline>S Modvig</underline><sup>1</sup>, M Degn<sup>1</sup>, JL Frederiksen<sup>1</sup>, F Sellebjerg<sup>2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Glostrup University Hospital, University of Copenhagen, Dept of Neurology, Glostrup, Denmark, <sup>2</sup>Danish MS Center, Rigshospitalet, University of Copenhagen, Dept of Neurology, Copenhagen, Denmark</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of inflammatory biomarkers have been suggested to predict multiple sclerosis (MS) development after clinically isolated syndromes, but there is a need for studies looking at the long-term prognosis.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To assess the predictive ability of CSF biomarkers of inflammation and tissue-damage with regards to development of clinically definite MS (CDMS) and long-term disability.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> 86 patients with acute optic neuritis (ON) as a first demyelinating event seen in our clinic between 1993 and 2002 were included retrospectively. Patients had undergone a lumbar puncture &#x0003c; 3 months from onset, CSF was stored at -80 C. Established MS-risk parameters (MRI, CSF leukocyte count, IgG-index and oligoclonal bands) were registered and CSF levels of chitinase-3-like-1 (CHI3L1), osteopontin, neurofilament light chain (NFL), myelin basic protein, CCL2, CXCL10, CXCL13 and matrix metalloproteinase-9 were measured by ELISA. Patients were followed up after a median time of 13.6 (range 9.6-19.4) years. 81.4 % were examined by the corresponding author incl. an EDSS and multiple sclerosis functional composit (MSFC) evaluation. 18.6 % were interviewed by phone, incl. an EDSS-questionnaire (Lechner-Scott et al, MSJ 2003). Time to CDMS was confirmed by collection of original charts from treating hospitals. Cox regression was used for time to CDMS, multivariate regression for multiple sclerosis severity score (MSSS) and Spearman correlation and linear regression for paced auditory serial addition test (PASAT).</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> 46 of 86 (53.5%) developed CDMS between ON and follow-up. Of the established MS-risk parameters, MRI (p=0.0008) and leukocyte count (p=0.036) combined predicted MS development best. These two were then tested in a second model with the other CSF biomarkers, where MRI (p=0.0001) and CHI3L1 (p=0.017) combined predicted MS development best. NFL was the only significant predictor of long-term disability as assessed by the MSSS (p=0.0465). CHI3L1 predicted long-term cognitive impairment as assessed by the PASAT (r=&#x02212;0.41, p=0.015).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> NFL and CHI3L1 were significant predictors of long-term physical and cognitive disability. We have previously suggested these to be markers of tissue damage-related inflammation in ON, supporting these findings. Furthermore, CHI3L1 appeared to predict CDMS better than the CSF parameters commonly used today. Thus, the two hold potential as clinically valuable biomarkers of future MS disease and disability after a first demyelinating event.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section506-1352458514546077"><title>P249</title><sec id="section507-1352458514546077"><title>Cerebrospinal fluid osteopontin and neurofilament levels mark different brain atrophy patterns in clinically isolated syndrome</title><p><underline>V Direnzo</underline><sup>1</sup>, C Tortorella<sup>1</sup>, S Zoccolella<sup>1</sup>, M Ruggieri<sup>1</sup>, M Mastrapasqua<sup>1</sup>, D Paolicelli<sup>1</sup>, F Dicuonzo<sup>1</sup>, M Trojano<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>University of Bari, Bari, Italy</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> MRI measures are known surrogate markers of disease activity and disability progression in patients with Clinically Isolated Syndrome (CIS) suggestive of Multiple Sclerosis (MS).

Measures of brain volume [total brain volume (TBV), grey matter volume (GMV), peripheral grey volume (PGV), white matter volume (WMV), and ventricular volume] were obtained by SIENAX.

Despite clear classification criteria, these diseases can be difficult to differentiate, especially early in the disease. However, early differentiation is of vital importance since misclassification can lead to deterioration of the condition due to incorrect medication.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> We hypothesized that analysis of &#x0201c;omics&#x0201d; in urine may have the capacity to yield quantitative biomarkers. In addition, MS and NMO/NMO-SD patients may exhibit specific differences in the molecular composition (proteins, posttranslational modifications) of the urine, which reflect the pathogenesis, and may enable early differentiation. Specifically, the hypothesis is tested by a thorough and unbiased analysis of the whole proteome.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Paired urine and plasma samples were collected from 7 age- and sex-matched patients with anti-AQP4<sup>+</sup> NMO, 7 patients with MS and 7 healthy controls (HS).

All samples were frozen at -70&#x000b0;C and stored for subsequent analysis. For each patient, a MRI scan was performed and the revised diagnostic criteria for MS used. Based on these criteria, patients were divided into four groups: remitting- relapsing MS (n=44), primary progressive MS (n=15), clinically isolated syndrome (n=27), and a symptomatic control (SC) group (n=39) who had neurological symptoms yet a normal CSF and a normal neurological clinical examination.

Both a relapsing remitting version of the condition and a progressive form of the condition has been identified, but there is a lack of pathobiological understanding. Prior research has identified a unique pattern of somatic hypermutation in B cells from MS patients that is able to discriminate between MS and other neurologic disease. Yet, the biological implications of this pattern, until now, has not been well understood. Prior pathological studies have identified subtypes of MS in biopsy and autopsy specimens, but there has been no way to biologically separate MS into subtypes without tissue. Creating a new diagnostic test for MS, based in the underlying biology of the disease would be beneficial both for clinical practice and for advancing our understanding of pathogenesis.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> This study was designed to confirm the clinical validity of the B cell somatic hypermutation pattern found in MS patients and to determine the biologic relevance of this pattern.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> CSF from over 300 patients being evaluated for MS was collected prospectively and handled in a uniform manner. Cells were isolated and next generation sequencing was used to amplify B cell sequences from the VH region. Patients were categorized as MS by an adjudication panel and the operating characteristics of the diagnostic test were analyzed. A subset of patients had recombinant antibodies generated form the unique sequences and were subjected to staining studies on mouse and human tissue.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Measurement of the somatic hypermutation frequency in MS patients yielded a diagnostic test for MS that was greater than 80% sensitive and specific. It was superior to conventional oligoclonal band data as historically presented. Recombinant antibodies from patients within this study were created and found to bind to neurons and astrocytes with unique patterns. Specific mutations were associated with different staining patterns. Analysis of data for correlations with cognitive outcomes is ongoing.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Quantifying somatic hypermutation patters is a viable technology for the clinic and provides a useful tool for diagnosing multiple sclerosis patterns. Studies of the recombinant antibodies produced from these patients has yielded novel insights into the pathogenesis of MS with a predominance of neuronal and astrocytic binding patterns being observed.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section514-1352458514546077"><title>P253</title><sec id="section515-1352458514546077"><title>Peripheral blood cells from patients with benign multiple sclerosis are characterized by a TNF gene expression signature</title><p><underline>NM Fissolo</underline><sup>1</sup>, R Nurtdinov<sup>1</sup>, L Negrotto<sup>1</sup>, S Malhotra<sup>1</sup>, &#x000c0; Vidal-Jordana<sup>1</sup>, J Castill&#x000f3;<sup>1</sup>, X Montalban<sup>1</sup>, M Comabella<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Vall Hebron University Hospital, Multiple Sclerosis Centre of Catalonia, Neuroimmunology Department, Barcelona, Spain</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Multiple sclerosis (MS) is one of the leading causes of disability among young adults. In approximately 80-85% of MS patients, the disease follows a relapsing-remitting course (RRMS). Over time, the majority of these patients will enter a progressive phase (secondary progressive MS - SPMS). The remaining 15-20% of MS patients follows an essentially progressive course from the beginning and they are referred to as primary progressive MS (PPMS). MS disease course is highly unpredictable and disease activity biomarkers that may help in the distinction between MS patients with benign and aggressive disease courses are unfortunately lacking.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> In the present study, we aimed to identify the gene expression signatures associated with different clinical forms of MS and activity phases of the disease.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> A total of 47 untreated MS patients and 19 healthy controls were included in the study. The MS group included 10 patients with early RRMS (in the first 5 years after disease onset), 10 patients with SPMS, 13 patients with PPMS, 10 patients with benign disease course (defined by EDSS &#x02264;3 after 10 years from disease onset), and 4 patients with aggressive disease courses (defined by the presence over the last year of 2 or more relapses and increase of at least one point in the EDSS). The gene expression profiling was determined in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from MS patients and HC using microarrays (Affymetrix HG-U219 chip).</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> PBMC from MS patients with benign disease course were characterized by an over-expression of TNF compared with cells from patients with other clinical forms and activity phases of the disease (p=1.6x10-7 vs. early RRMS; p=1.5x10-7 vs. SPMS; p=8.2x10-6 vs. PPMS; p=1.9x10-4 vs. aggressive MS) and HC (p=4.5x10-6). A large number of TNF-induced genes were also significantly up-regulated in PBMC from patients with benign MS, which included IL1B, CXCL2, CXCL3, CCL3, IER3, NFKBIA, and TNFAIP3 among others. Microarray findings were validated by real time PCR.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Unexpected results from clinical trials with anti-TNF therapies in MS patients together with the finding of a TNF signature in patients with benign course suggest that TNF, rather than being harmful to MS, could play beneficial roles in disease evolution.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section516-1352458514546077"><title>P254</title><sec id="section517-1352458514546077"><title>Cerebrospinal fluid proteome analysis reveals differentially abundant proteins in multiple sclerosis</title><p><underline>J F&#x000fc;vesi</underline><sup>1</sup>, R Danielsson<sup>2</sup>, K Bencsik<sup>1</sup>, J Hanrieder<sup>2,3</sup>, V Zsiros<sup>1</sup>, C Rajda<sup>1</sup>, P H&#x000e5;kansson<sup>4</sup>, L V&#x000e9;csei<sup>1,5</sup>, J Bergquist<sup>2,6</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>University of Szeged, Department of Neurology, Szeged, Hungary, <sup>2</sup>Uppsala University, Analytical Chemistry, Department of Chemistry-Biomedical Center, Uppsala, Sweden, <sup>3</sup>Chalmers University of Technology, Analytical Chemistry, Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering, G&#x000f6;teborg, Sweden, <sup>4</sup>Uppsala University, Department of Physics and Astronomy, Uppsala, Sweden, <sup>5</sup>MTA-SZTE Neuroscience Research Group, Szeged, Hungary, <sup>6</sup>Uppsala University, Science for Life Laboratory (SciLife Lab), Uppsala, Sweden</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a demyelinative disorder of the central nervous system that affects mainly young adults.

CSF samples were obtained from diagnostic lumbar puncture (LP). The MS group included clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) (n=10), relapsing-remitting (R) (n=6) patient samples and a few samples from secondary and primary progressive clinical forms of the disease as well as a fulminant case. In case of the control subjects the presenting symptom was headache, but the routine CSF analysis gave normal values. Each sample was measured at least twice. The raw data was calibrated using mass and retention time values of human serum albumin peptides. Based on the combined mass and normalized retention time (net) values 2891 variables could be distinguished. These were compared to the mass and net values of a data base of proteins previously found in CSF by in silico digestion. The intensities of the well identified proteins were compared between the sample groups and expressed as ratios (CIS/C, R/C, CIS/R, MS/C).</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The mean age (year) at LP was 30.7 in the CIS, 35.2 in the R and 33.0 in the C group.

The mean EDSS was 1.6 points in the CIS and 2.4 in the R group, respectively.</p><p>Fifty proteins were identified with at least 20 % coverage of all possible hits in the SwissProt database.

Increased levels of NFL in CSF have therefore been used as a marker for ongoing axonal damage, for example in patients with multiple sclerosis. In order to interpret values of NFL in a diseased state, knowledge of NFL in the healthy is required. Another biomarker for neurodegeneration is the investigation of brain atrophy using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), commonly measured as brain parenchymal fraction (BPF). Both brain atrophy and levels of NFL are associated with neurodegeneration, for example in the case of multiple sclerosis, where both are associated with increased disease activity. A potential correlation between levels of NFL and BPF in healthy individuals has not been investigated.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> This study aims to present the levels of NFL in healthy individuals stratified for age, and investigate if NFL is correlated to brain atrophy measured by MRI.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> The level of NFL in CSF was analysed in 53 healthy volunteers aged 21 to 63. In addition, 48 of the volunteers underwent MRI and BPF was determined via a semiautomatic, relaxometry based technique.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Mean (&#x000b1;SD) NFL of the whole study population was 355 (&#x000b1;214), mean BPF was 0.867 (&#x000b1;0.035). When divided into subgroups stratified for age, the mean NFL was: age 20 to 30 years: 186 (&#x000b1;50.0, n=17), age 30 to 40 years: 288 (&#x000b1;47.2, n=15), age 40 to 60 years: 491 (&#x000b1;170, n=18), age over 60 years: 834 (&#x000b1;356, n=3). Both the level of NFL and the BPF was significantly correlated with age and with each other, but the correlation between BPF and NFL did not retain statistical significance if controlled for age.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> This study presents data on age-stratified levels of NFL in the CSF of healthy individuals. It is shown that levels of NFL increase with age.

Understanding this is beneficial for prognosis, treatment strategies and for the development of new neuro-protective therapies.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To unravel the patho-physiology of MS disease progression and possible identification of progression biomarkers, we performed proteomics on plasma of relapse-remitting MS (RRMS) patients with a benign disease course, RRMS patients with an aggressive disease course and primary progressive MS (PPMS) patients.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> The proteomics assay is a multiplex aptamers platform (Somalogic). This highly sensitive assay allows detection of 1129 markers in body fluids of choice. A selection of patients based on their baseline and follow-up expanded disability status scale (EDSS) scores was performed. An exploratory phase was conducted on plasma of RRMS patients with a benign disease course (n=10), aggressive disease course (n=10) and PPMS (n=10). Subsequently, to validate the exploratory data, a selection of patients with a comparable progression rates, age, gender and subtypes from an independent cohort was made. Moreover, for the validation cohort healthy controls (n=10) were included.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Comparisons between RRMS-benign and RRMS-aggressive groups, for both independent runs, showed discovery of approximately 50 significant markers. These markers primarily associated with inflammatory and intracellular pathways. The validation run confirmed four out of the fifty markers. Comparisons between RRMS-all and PPMS for both runs, resulted in discovery of approximately 70 significant markers. This markers associated with cell cycle, apoptotic and metabolic pathways. Validation run confirmed five markers between these groups.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> These findings support the idea that the disease progression of RRMS could be associated with immune related pathways, whereas the pathophysiology of the PPMS subtype could be represented by alterations in cell cycle and apoptosis related alterations and therefore follows a steady neurodegenerative course with no immune related exacerbations. Moreover, validations of the confirmed markers that potentially could be used as progression biomarkers are ongoing.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section524-1352458514546077"><title>P258</title><sec id="section525-1352458514546077"><title>Orbitrap proteomics analysis of cerebrospinal fluid to identify novel markers for progression after a first attack of demyelination</title><p><underline>TF Runia</underline><sup>1</sup>, M Stoop<sup>1</sup>, C Stingl<sup>1</sup>, T Luider<sup>1</sup>, RQ Hintzen<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Erasmus MC, Neurology, Rotterdam, Netherlands</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> In recent studies we have shown the validity of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteomics studies for the detection of pathologically relevant proteins for multiple sclerosis (MS). Because the course of the disease after clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), the first presenting symptom of MS, is highly variable, there is a strong need for biomarkers in CIS patients.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To identify novel markers for disease progression after CIS using advanced mass spectrometry techniques.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> We included 47 CIS patients with CSF samples, clinical and MRI data collected within 2 months after symptom onset, and 64 controls. CSF samples were enzymatically digested and subsequently measured on a nanoLC-ESI-Orbitrap mass spectrometer. Using a 180 minute chromatographic gradient on a 50 centimeter C18 column the digested peptides were separated prior to measurement on the mass spectrometer to enable the identification of a maximum and unprecedented amount of proteins in one run. Machine performance was monitored by measuring a quality control sample after every six samples. The mass spectra were analyzed using specialized software (Progenesis LC-MS), and the identified proteins were analyzed for statistically significant abundance between groups.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 3009 peptides were identified, relating to 555 proteins. Only 2 proteins were significantly more abundant in CSF of CIS patients than in controls: chitinase 3-like protein 1, and Ig kappa chain VII region. 11 proteins were lower in CIS patients than controls (Voltage-dependent calcium channel subunit alpha-2/delta-1, Seizure 6-like protein 2, Calsyntenin-3, Neurosecretory protein VGF, Superoxide dismutase [Cu-Zn], Ribonuclease pancreatic, Trans-Golgi network integral membrane protein 2, Extracellular matrix protein 1, Transmembrane protein 132A, Cerebellin-3, Xylosyltransferase 1). There were no significant differences in protein levels between patients who did and did not reach a diagnosis of clinically definite MS. We also found no differences related to the number of MRI lesions, type of CIS or fatigue.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> This confirms the earlier finding of chitinase 3-like 1 in the pathology of MS when compared to controls, but does not confirm its association with conversion to clinically definite MS. A striking finding is, that most found proteins were actually lower in CIS patients than in controls, which is counterintuitive but might lead to new insights into the pathophysiology of MS.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section526-1352458514546077"><title>P259</title><sec id="section527-1352458514546077"><title>Metabolomics of cerebrospinal fluid from progressive MS patients</title><p><underline>F Mir</underline><sup>1</sup>, D Lee<sup>1</sup>, H Ray<sup>1</sup>, SA Sadiq<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Tisch MS Research Center of New York, New York, NY, United States</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Identification of biomarkers for diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) has proven difficult due to the varied clinical course and complex pathophysiology associated with this autoimmune condition.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> The purpose of this study was to determine and compare the global metabolic profiles in human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) associated with disease progression in multiple sclerosis (MS) and allow stratification of the two progressive disease subtypes.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> CSF obtained from controls with no disease (n=15), patients with primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS; n=15), and patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS; n=15) were analyzed on the GC/MS and LC/MS/MS platforms conducted by Metabolon (Durham, NC).</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 198 compounds of known identity were included in the analysis. 26 biochemicals were found to be significantly affected in the MS cohort as compared to the controls.

Levels of 8-Isoprostane are increased in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), with maximum levels in patients with secondary progressive MS (SPMS), and CSF levels of 8-Isoprostane were associated with disease activity (Mir, 2011; Sbardella, 2011). 8-Isoprostane can be detected in urine and levels have been reported to be dramatically (6-fold) increased in SPMS patients (Miller et al., 2011), but this finding has yet to be confirmed.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To determine 1) if 8-Isoprostane urine levels are higher in patients with SPMS, and 2) if 8-Isoprostane urine levels can be used as biomarkers for disease activity and/or disease progression in MS.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> We obtained random spot urine samples from 104 MS patients (90 RRMS/14 SPMS) and 23 healthy controls from the CLIMB Study (Comprehensive Longitudinal Investigation of MS at Brigham and Women&#x02019;s Hospital) at Partners MS Center. Thirty-seven patients were untreated, while the remaining patients were treated with glatiramer acetate (n=26), interferon-&#x003b2; (n=22), natalizumab (n=11), or fingolimod (n=8). 8-Isoprostane was analyzed using a commercially available ELISA kit (Oxford Biomedical Research, Oxford, MI) after glucuronidase treatment to measure total urine output of 8-Isoprostane and results were normalized to creatinine levels (Oxford Biomedical).</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Patients with SPMS did not have elevated levels of 8-Isoprostane in urine (0.031&#x000b1;0.016; mean&#x000b1;SD) compared to relapsing-remitting (RR) MS patients (0.032&#x000b1;0.025) or healthy controls (0.027&#x000b1;0.023; p=0.84).

Systemic intravenous (IV) doses of BIIB033 up to 100 mg/kg were well tolerated in 2 randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled, phase I studies, the single ascending dose (SAD; 0.1 to 100 mg/kg; n=72) study in healthy volunteers and the multiple ascending doses (MAD; 0.3 to 100 mg/kg IV; 2 doses separated by 14 days; n=47) study in participants with RRMS or SPMS. One objective of these studies was to identify potential biomarkers of BIIB033 activity in the CNS among proteins, lipids, or carbohydrates produced during remyelination and secreted into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), blood, and/or urine. Leading candidates included markers of neuroaxonal damage, inflammation and remyelination such as neurofilament heavy and light chain (NF-H and NF-L), osteopontin, NCAM, beta amyloid peptides (a-beta) 1-40 and 1-42, and galactosyl sphingolipids (GalCers and sulfatides), as well as soluble LINGO-1 (sLINGO-1), a potential marker of BIIB033 target engagement.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To determine whether potential biomarkers of BIIB033 activity in the CSF of participants in the SAD and MAD studies were modulated by 1 or 2 doses of BIIB033.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> CSF was collected two weeks after the last dose from participants who received &#x02265;10mg/kg BIIB033 in the SAD study and from all cohorts in the MAD study. sLINGO-1, NF-H and L, NCAM, osteopontin and a-beta 40 and 42 were measured by ELISA.

MRI scans were analyzed for gadolinium-enhancing (Gd) lesion number and volume, and for T2 lesion number and volume. RNA was extracted from five subjects with MRI activity, and gene expression was measured using Illumina human microarrays.

Pearson correlation was calculated for blood collected at the same time as the MRI, and for specimens collected 2 and 4 weeks preceding the MRI.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Among the 5 subjects, there were 132 nominally significant correlations (p&#x0003c; 0.05) between mRNA expression and MRI activity. The largest number (63) of the correlations occurred 4 weeks before MRI. There were 70 distinct transcripts, which included 45 documented protein coding genes. Seven of these are proteins induced by interferon.

Many of the altered transcripts are regulated by interferon. The number of subjects studied is small, but the results suggest immune changes before MS activity will differ widely between individuals.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section538-1352458514546077"><title>P265</title><sec id="section539-1352458514546077"><title>Identification of multiple sclerosis cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy</title><p><underline>MA Pawlak</underline><sup>1</sup>, E Jodlowska<sup>1</sup>, B Gierczyk<sup>2</sup>, L Popenda<sup>3,4</sup>, S Jurga<sup>3,5</sup>, R Kazmierski<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Poznan University of Medical Sciences, Department of Neurology and Cerebrovascular Disorders, Poznan, Poland, <sup>2</sup>Adam Mickiewicz University, Faculty of Chemistry, Supramolecular Chemistry, Poznan, Poland, <sup>3</sup>Adam Mickiewicz University, NanoBioMedical Centre, Poznan, Poland, <sup>4</sup>Polish Academy of Sciences, Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry, Poznan, Poland, <sup>5</sup>Adam Mickiewicz University, Department of Macromolecular Physics, Poznan, Poland</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy identifies metabolites of small molecular weight present in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS) and clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) is based on a combination of symptoms, laboratory tests and MRI results, and sometimes is not conclusive especially early in the disease process. Previous studies that employed NMR to examine the CSF of patients with CIS and MS focused mainly on differences and did not use receiver operator characteristics (ROC) curves statistics to assess the peaks. Additionaly they usually involved sample pH adjustment that could influence the metabolites and their stability.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To identify CSF metabolites differentiating CIS and MS from other non-inflammatory neurological diseases using ROC curves and area under the curve (AUC) &#x0003e;0.6</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Patient population consisted of 17 MS patients and 26 CIS patients. They were compared to 42 control patients with headaches and other non-inflammatory neurological disorders. CSF samples were stored at -80C until further analysis. We did not use pH adjustment prior to the acquisition using 800Hz Agilent NMR spectrometer. The spectra were phase- and baseline corrected, normalized and the peaks were manually integrated and scaled relative to glucose using MestReNova software. Statistical analysis was performed using R-CRAN environment, package ChemoSpec, ExpDes and ROCR packages were used for ANOVA and ROC analysis.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> ANOVA identified significant associations at the chemical shift of 1.70, 2.10, 3.35, 3.60, 3.65, 3.68 and 3.75 ppm. ROC curve AUC for MS vs. control for 2.10 ppm was equal to 0.79. CIS vs. control group for 3.65 ppm AUC was 0.76. Joint analysis for CIS+MS vs. control group identified 8 associations: 3.75, 3.68, 3.25, 2.95, 1.20, 1.00 and 0.75 ppm. ROC characterized by AUC&#x0003e; 0.60 was identified for 1.00 (AUC 0.69), 1.20 (0.64), 2.1 (0.64), 2.95 (0.66), 3.3 (0.64), 3.25 (0.63), 3.68 (0.64), 3.75 (0.63).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Application of ROC curves to assess the predictive value of individual NMR peaks can identify individual spectral features useful in CSF metabolomics. Lack of differences between the CIS and MS groups indicates a common biochemical basis of those conditions. The differences between MS+CIS and controls indicate potential for small molecular weight biomarkers in diagnosis of early phase demyelinating disease.

Total RNA was isolated from CD4+ T-cells and integrity measured on a Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent Technologies). NGS of miRNA was performed using the TruSeq Small RNA sample preparation kit on a HiSeq2500 Rapid system (Illumina) with 50bp fragment length. All reads were adapter trimmed and aligned against the human genome and miRBase v20. miRNA differential expression between SPMS and HC were identified and RT-qPCR used to confirm the most deregulated miRNA candidates.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The extracted RNA performed exceptionally well in QC experiments and RNA integrity number scores ranged from 8.6-9.6. All samples yielded &#x0003e;1ug of RNA; sufficient for NGS and confirmatory experiments. NGS performed above average (4-9 million reads/sample) and is suitable for expression profiling and novel small RNA discovery. Preliminary analyses of the sequencing data identified &#x0003e;300 miRNA expressed in the CD4+ T-cells of SPMS individuals and HCs.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Prediction algorithms will determine the likely mRNA targets of differentially expressed miRNAs in the CD4+ T-cells of SPMS individuals. The potential effects of these miRNA on cellular behavior in MS can then be determined. Future functional studies on these miRNA in CD4+ T-cells will confirm these targets and further inform our understanding of the clinical relevance of miRNA-dependent regulatory mechanisms in MS progression.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section542-1352458514546077"><title>P267</title><sec id="section543-1352458514546077"><title>MicroRNA-572 expression in serum of multiple sclerosis patients with different patterns of disease progression</title><p><underline>S Agostini</underline><sup>1</sup>, R Mancuso<sup>1</sup>, A Hernis<sup>1</sup>, M Rovaris<sup>1</sup>, D Caputo<sup>1</sup>, M Clerici<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Don C. Gnocchi Foundation, Lab Molecular Medicine, Milano, Italy</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Clinical progression of multiple sclerosis (MS) is correlated to accumulation of impairment due to demyelination, and failure of remyelination is one of the mechanism involved in the axonal degeneration. A higher remyelination capacity has been observed in the brain of primary progressive (PPMS) compared to secondary progressive (SPMS) patients. The identification of biomarkers for remyelination represents an important scientific challenge; in particular the discover of circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) associated to this process may represent the first key step toward the development of in vivo non-invasive blood-based molecular test. A recent microarray study evidenced 7 dysregulated miRNAs in serum of MS patients compared to HC. A predicted target of one of these (miR-572) is neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM-1): this cell membrane glycoprotein mediates adhesion between neuronal and glial cells; consequently different level of this miRNA could be related to different remyelination capacity.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To verify the presence and expression level of a particular miRNA (miR-572) in serum from patients with different form of MS and from HC.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> A group of 27 chronic progressive (14 PP- and 13 SP-) and 31 relapsing remitting (RR-) MS patients and, a group of 15 sex/age matched healthy controls were included in the study. miRNA isolation from serum was performed with a column based kit (miRNeasy Mini KIT- QIAGEN). Specific LNA<sup>TM</sup>-individual microRNA assays (Exiqon) were used to qPCR detection of miR-572 in sera.

The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) (72%, 95%CI: 0.598-0.815%) suggests that this miRNA has a good predictive value, in particular to distinguish for SPMS (AUC:92%;95%CI: 0.611-0.933) and PPMS (AUC:88%;95%CI: 0.713-0.973) from HC.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> As miR-572 upregulation could correspond to reduced remyelination capacity, observed changes in serum of MS patient in different clinical form as well as correlation to disability score suggest that this miRNA may serve as potential non invasive biomarker for remyelination.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section544-1352458514546077"><title>P268</title><sec id="section545-1352458514546077"><title>Uric acid levels are reduced in multiple sclerosis</title><p><underline>M Moccia</underline><sup>1</sup>, R Lanzillo<sup>1</sup>, R Palladino<sup>2,3</sup>, C Russo<sup>1</sup>, A Carotenuto<sup>1</sup>, M Massarelli<sup>1</sup>, G Vacca<sup>1</sup>, V Vacchiano<sup>1</sup>, V Brescia Morra<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>University Federico II, Department of Neurosciences, Napoli, Italy, <sup>2</sup>Imperial College, Department of Primary Care and Public Health, London, United Kingdom, <sup>3</sup>University Federico II, Department of Public Health, Napoli, Italy</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Multiple sclerosis (MS) pathogenesis represents a significant challenge in consideration of subsequent therapeutical approaches. Considering the possible role of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species in inflammation, demyelination and axonal injury, natural scavengers, such as uric acid (UA), have been widely investigated. In particular, serum UA levels have been studied in relation to MS risk, clinical picture, neuroradiological activity, and treatments. However, there is poor accordance within different studies, possibly due to small sample size.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> We mainly aim to evaluate differences in UA levels between MS subjects and controls. A secondary endpoint is the possible relationship between UA levels and MS activity.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> We consecutively recruited 415 MS subjects (245 females, 170 males) at the Center for Multiple Sclerosis of the University Hospital &#x0201c;Federico II&#x0201d; from January to December 2013. MS subjects were matched for age and gender with 111 healthy subjects (63 females, 48 males). MS subjects and controls were evaluated for UA levels, and for concomitant diseases or treatments possibly modifying UA values. MS subjects were classified according to EDSS score (3.9&#x000b1;1.4), disease modifying treatment, and current clinical picture (297 relapsing remitting MS, 118 secondary progressive MS).</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> At t-test, MS subjects presented significantly lower UA levels (253.6&#x000b1;3.0 mmol/L) than controls (269.2&#x000b1;6.6 mmol/L) (p=0.022).

An important proportion of MS patients suffers from a progressive course of the disease, with sustained neurological deterioration and without options of receiving effective therapies to halt progression. In this scenario, a more in-depth understanding of the prognostic factors that make MS patients to progress slower or faster in their disability will be critical to stratify them according to disease evolution.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> We aimed to identify genes associated with disability progression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from patients with primary progressive MS (PPMS).</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Patients with PPMS were classified according to worsening of disability over a two-year period. Disability progression was defined as a confirmed increase in the EDSS score of at least 2 points during the two-year follow-up period. Ten PPMS patients were included in the study, 5 patients with disability progression and 5 patients whose EDSS scores remained stable over the follow-up period. In these patients, the gene expression profiles were determined in PBMC at baseline and after two years of follow-up by means of the Affymetrix GeneChip&#x000ae; Human Transcriptome Array 2.0.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Gene expression profiling study using microarrays in PPMS patients with and without worsening of disability led to the identification of a number of differentially expressed genes associated with disability progression. The most differentially expressed gene between patients with and without disability progression corresponded to SH2B3 (SH2B adaptor protein 3). At baseline, SH2B3 expression levels were significantly lower in PPMS patients with disability progression compared to patients without disability progression (p=0.014), and differences remained significant over the two-year follow-up period (group effect: p=2.1x10-6). A significant time effect in SH2B3 expression was observed in PPMS patients with disability progression, and SH2B3 expression levels decreased over time (p=1.9x10-3) in this group of patients whereas remained statistically non-significant in patients with stable EDSS scores.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The SH2B3 gene encodes a key negative regulator of cytokine signalling that has been associated with susceptibility to several autoimmune disorders including MS.

NfL levels were determined using a commercial ELISA kit. A 900 ng/L cut-off was obtained from a control group of patients with other non-inflammatory neurological disorders. Primary endpoints were conversion to clinically definite (CD) MS and 2010 McDonald MS according to NfL status (positive/negative). Uni- and multivariate analyses were performed for NfL levels as a continuous value and evaluated with oligoclonal bands and T2 lesion number on baseline MR. Disease modifying treatment (DMT) and hospital were considered covariates. NfL levels were compared in terms of disability (EDSS &#x0003e;=3.0). Correlations with MR inflammation variables at baseline and on follow-up were determined.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> In total, 155 patients were evaluated: 101 (65.2%) were female with a mean age (SD) of 33.6 (8.8) years and a follow-up of 44.2 (27.3) months; 48 (31.0%) converted to CDMS. DMT was started before CDMS in 46 (29.7%) patients. Median (IQR) NfL levels were 1238.3 (1782.1) for CDMS and 555.8 (825.5) ng/L for CIS. With the cut-off 900, 63 (40.6%) patients were NfL positive: 28/63 (44.4%) with positive and 20/92 (21.7%) with negative NfL converted to CDMS (log rank p=0.004), whereas 43/63 (68.2%) with positive and 31/92 (33.7%) with negative NfL fulfilled McDonald MS (log rank &#x0003c; 0.0001).

The extensive loss of AQP4 and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) were revealed in pathological studies in NMO, especially in the perivascular regions with complement and immunoglobulin depositions. We revealed elevated CSF-GFAP in NMO patients in the past study, but the clinical significance of tissue damage and the relation with other inflammatory demyelinating disease are unknown. Also, comprehensive study of CSF biomarkers including GFAP and myelin basic proteins (MBP) in inflammatory demyelinating diseases is still lacking.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To clarify the usefulness of CSF biomarkers including GFAP and MBP in the diagnosis and the prognosis of inflammatory demyelinating diseases (e.g.: NMOsd, seronegative NMO, Multiple Sclerosis (MS), Tumefactive demyelinating disease (TDD), Neuro-Behcet&#x02019;s disease).</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> We conducted multicentric cross-sectional study in Japan from January 1999 to December 2012 including 129 patients who diagnosed as inflammatory demyelinating diseases and 12 healthy control cases. CSF-GFAP and CSF-MBP were measured by sandwich ELISA kit. The corrected data was analyzed by Graphpad Prism 5.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> CSF-GFAP/MBP ratio in seropositive NMOsd showed significantly higher than that in MS (cut-off: 0.082, sensitivity 86.84%, specificity 96.15%). In spite of the relative low prevalence of CSF-GFAP of NMOsd in optic lesion (47%), CSF-GFAP/MBP ratio improved the positivity in optic lesion (73%). The prevalence of CSF-GFAP/MBP ratio of NMOsd in cerebral lesion and spinal cord lesion is high as well as CSF-GFAP (100% and 90%, respectively). CSF-GFAP level is tend to decrease in accordance with the duration of CSF-collected day from estimated relapse day. On the other hand, CSF-MBP level is no tendency of decrease, which may reflect the difference in the time course of cytotoxic events between astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. There is no correlation between CSF-GFAP and serum anti-AQP4 antibody titers.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Elevated CSF-GFAP levels in the inflammatory demyelinating diseases, such as NMOsd, reflect acute astrocytic destructive damages. CSF-GFAP level itself in the relapse of optic neuritis in NMOsd is relatively low prevalence than cerebral lesion or myelitis, but CSF-GFAP/MBP ratio may improve the sensitivity. Obtaining CSF in the acute phase of NMO relapse is preferable for making precise diagnoses by CSF-GFAP.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section552-1352458514546077"><title>P272</title><sec id="section553-1352458514546077"><title>CSF fetuin-A is a biomarker of subclinical disease activity in progressive MS</title><p><underline>VK Harris</underline><sup>1</sup>, M Landy<sup>1</sup>, S Chirls<sup>1</sup>, I Londono<sup>1</sup>, SA Sadiq<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Tisch MS Research Center of New York, New York, NY, United States</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> There is a need for accurate and predictable biomarkers for the effective stratification of treatment for individual MS patients. In particular, biomarkers measuring disease activity in progressive MS would be particular useful since disease worsening is difficult to quantify using standard imaging metrics. We recently identified Fetuin-A as a CSF biomarker that was elevated in relapsing remitting (RRMS) patients with active disease. In addition, reduced CSF Fetuin-A in RRMS patients treated with natalizumab for one year correlated with therapeutic response to the drug. A direct role for Fetuin-A in MS pathogenesis is supported by EAE animal studies which showed that Fetuin-A contributed to disease severity, and its expression was markedly upregulated in demyelinated areas and in gray matter within human MS and mouse EAE brain tissue.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To determine if Fetuin-A levels in CSF correlate with disease progression/activity in patients with progressive MS.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Patients with clinically definite secondary progressive (SPMS) (n=75) and clinically definite primary progressive (PPMS) (n=40) were classified as having disease activity on the basis of patient self-reporting, EDSS, and MRI over a period of 24 months.

Recent data, including from our group, highlighted the involvement of LCN2 in the murine experimental auto-immune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model of multiple sclerosis (MS), by showing that its expression in the brain parenchyma, the choroid plexus and the CSF increases during relapse, decreases during remission and is abrogated by natalizumab treatment. In addition, LCN2 knockout mice displayed a different EAE phenotype, with more animals developing a chronic/progressive course associated to increased parenchymal inflammation. Importantly, these results seemed relevant for the human disease, as, in a preliminary study, CSF LCN2 levels were increased in MS cases compared with controls.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> The aim of the present study was to assess whether CSF LCN2 levels at diagnosis were associated with clinical severity in a multiple sclerosis cohort followed in our clinic.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Normal 0 21 false false false PT X-NONE X-NONE MicrosoftInternetExplorer4 Patients performing lumbar puncture as part of their initial diagnostic workup for suspected MS gave informed consent to participate on a longitudinal prospective study, ongoing in our centre since 2008 (MIND-MS).

LCN2 levels were determined with an ELISA assay developed in-house, validated against a commercially available kit (R&#x00026;D systems). Patients were then prospectively followed every 6 months, and clinical information recorded on a longitudinal database.

Mean LCN2 levels in CSF were 1,72 ng/mL (+-0,97) and were not related with CSF leucocyte number or detection of oligoclonal bands or number of Barkhoff criteria or presence of gadolinium enhancing lesions in the MRI at the time of CSF collection. More importantly, LCN2 levels above average predicted a faster disease progression to an EDSS of 3 or higher (Cox regression p=0,015 OR=0,249).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our results suggest that higher lipocalin-2 levels might predict a faster disease progression.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section566-1352458514546077"><title>P279</title><sec id="section567-1352458514546077"><title>Expression of miRNAs in multiple sclerosis cerebrospinal fluid and their relation to MR activity</title><p><underline>E Quintana</underline><sup>1</sup>, B Beltr&#x000e1;n<sup>2</sup>, S Valverde<sup>3</sup>, R Robles-Cede&#x000f1;o<sup>1,4</sup>, H Perkal<sup>1</sup>, X Llad&#x000f3;<sup>3</sup>, JM Fern&#x000e1;ndez-Real<sup>5</sup>, L Rami&#x000f3;-Torrent&#x000e0;<sup>1,4</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Girona Biomedical Research Institute (IDIBGI), Neurodegeneration and Neuroinflamation Group, Girona, Spain, <sup>2</sup>IDI MRI-Unit, Radiology Department, Dr. Josep Trueta University Hospital, Girona, Spain, <sup>3</sup>University of Girona, Department of Computer Architecture and Technology (VICOROB Group), Girona, Spain, <sup>4</sup>Neuroimmunology and Multiple Sclerosis Unit, Dr. Josep Trueta University Hospital, Department of Neurology, Girona, Spain, <sup>5</sup>Endocrinology and Nutrition (UDEN), Girona Biomedical Research Institute (IDIBGI), and CIBER de la Fisiopatolog&#x000ed;a de la Obesidad y la Nutrici&#x000f3;n (CIBERobn, CB06/03), Department of Diabetes, Girona, Spain</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory, demyelinating and neurodegenerative disease leading to both physical and cognitive impairment. Magnetic resonance (MR) is the most sensitive tool to investigate the brain tissue damage occurring in MS and it is the most used biomarker for the diagnosis and follow-up. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs that regulate the gene expression. miRNAs are present in biological fluids and might be used as disease biomarkers. Some miRNAs (miR-21, miR-155, miR-146a and miR-142-3p) have been implicated in MS immune processes.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To evaluate the association between the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) expression of miR-21, miR-155, miR-146a and miR-142-3p and different MR parameters in MS patients.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> An observational cross-sectional study was designed. Circulating RNAs were extracted, retrotranscripted and preamplificated from CSF, and miRNAs were quantified in a real-time PCR. MR parameters analysed were: number of lesions in T2, number of gadolinium enhancing lesions (Gd+) in T1, presence of hipointense T1 lesions (hipoT1), and brain parenchymal fraction (BPF).</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> 29 patients (79.30% were female) with a mean age of 40 (&#x000b1; 10.22) years old were analysed. Positive correlations were observed between Gd+ and miR-21 expression (r=0.418, p=0.030) and BPF with both miR-155 and miR-142-3p expression (r=0.541, p=0.021 and r=0.602, p=0.010 respectively). A downregulation of miR-142-3p in patients with hipoT1 compared with those without (0.016 vs. 0.067; p=0.017) and an upregulation of miR-146a in patients with &#x02265;9 lesions in T2 compared with those with &#x0003c; 9 lesions (0.325 vs. 0.197; p=0.021) were also found.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> miR-21 and miR-146a upregulation were found related to MR activity. miR-155 and miR-142-3p, which are related to inflammation, were found associated to less brain atrophy.

Decades of study have yielded considerable insight into GA&#x02019;s mode of action, yet the precise mechanism remains to be fully characterized. GA has a highly complex colloidal composition in solution, so small manufacturing differences can have significant impact.

Weighted paired t-test and weighted frailty Cox proportional hazards model were used to evaluate differences in disease outcomes.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Amongst the 692 (IFN/GA) and 206 (fingolimod) patients eligible for matching, the switch to fingolimod was associated with relatively longer MS duration, lower number of pre-treatment relapses (but higher number of steroid-treated relapses), higher number of previous treatment starts and residence in Australia or Turkey. The 477 (IFN/GA) and 149 (fingolimod) matched patients differed only in the year of treatment switch. Median pairwise-censored on-treatment follow-up was 11 months. Patients in the fingolimod group had an annualised relapse rate of 0.31 compared to 0.59 in the IFN/GA group (p=0.01) and a lower hazard of relapse (hazard ratio 0.50). There was no difference in the post-switch disability between the two groups. Persistence on fingolimod was better compared to IFN/GA (hazard ratio 0.39). Sensitivity analyses confirmed the results of the primary analysis.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Following an on-treatment relapse on IFN/GA, switching to fingolimod is associated with lower hazard of relapses and increased treatment persistence compared with switching to another IFN/GA preparation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section579-1352458514546077"><title>P285</title><sec id="section580-1352458514546077"><title>Clinical markers of long-term disability in RRMS patients treated with interferon beta</title><p><underline>J R&#x000ed;o</underline><sup>1</sup>, S Otero-Romero<sup>1,2</sup>, M Tintor&#x000e9;<sup>1</sup>, M Comabella<sup>1</sup>, C Nos<sup>1</sup>, L Negrotto<sup>1</sup>, I Gal&#x000e1;n<sup>1</sup>, &#x000c0; Vidal-Jordana<sup>1</sup>, J Castill&#x000f3;<sup>1</sup>, F Palavra<sup>1</sup>, E Sim&#x000f3;n<sup>1</sup>, G Arrambide<sup>1</sup>, J Sastre-Garriga<sup>1</sup>, X Montalban<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Vall Hebron University Hospital, Multiple Sclerosis Centre of Catalonia, Neuroimmunology Department, Barcelona, Spain, <sup>2</sup>Vall Hebron University Hospital, Preventive Medicine and Epidemiology Department, Barcelona, Spain</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Clinical markers of long-term disability in RRMS patients treated with interferon beta</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To investigate the association between early clinical activity during interferon beta therapy (IFN&#x003b2;) and long-term disability outcomes in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS).</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> A prospective and longitudinal 12-year follow-up study of patients with RRMS treated with IFN&#x003b2; was conducted. All patients included underwent a neurological evaluation every 3 or 6 months for assessing disability (EDSS score) and relapses. Disease activity during the first 2 years was defined as: presence of at least 1 relapse, presence of at least 2 relapses, confirmed increase of at least 1 EDSS point and confirmed increase of 1 EDSS point plus relapses. Hazard ratios were calculated for early disease activity predicting severe long-term disability outcomes (5-step EDSS worsening, wheel-chair bound or secondary progressive stage of the disease) during the 12-year interval.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> From an original prospective cohort of 1450 patients treated with IFN&#x003b2;, we included 234 patients with a follow-up of at least 12 years. One hundred and twenty patients (51%) were clinically active during the first 2 years of treatment, ranging from 18% for patients with a confirmed increase of 1 EDSS point plus relapses to 46% for patients experiencing at least 1 relapse. Persistent disease activity during the first 2 years of therapy predicted severe long-term disability worsening: confirmed increase of 1 EDSS point (HR 9.1; 4.1-22.6), at least 1 relapse (HR 4.4; 1.7-11.7), at least 2 relapses (HR 3.6; 1.6-8.1), and confirmed increase of 1 EDSS point plus relapse (HR 11.7; 5.3-26) for patients wheel-chair bounded; confirmed increase of 1 EDSS point (HR 10.2; 5.7-18.6), at least 1 relapse (HR 3.8; 2-7.1), at least 2 relapses (HR 3.9; 2.1-7.1), and confirmed increase of 1 EDSS point plus relapse (HR 9; 4.9-16.4) for patients with 5-step EDSS worsening; confirmed increase of 1 EDSS point (HR 9.4; 4-22.5), at least 1 relapse (HR 2.2; 1.2-4.2), at least 2 relapses (HR 2.1; 1-4.7), and confirmed increase of 1 EDSS point plus relapse (HR 6.9; 2.7-18.1) for patients evolving to secondary progressive MS.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Disease activity during the first two years of treatment with IFN&#x003b2; is associated with worse long-term outcomes. The results provide rationale for close clinical monitoring of IFN&#x003b2;-treated patients, and eventually for therapy switch and/or escalation in patients with active disease.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section581-1352458514546077"><title>P286</title><sec id="section582-1352458514546077"><title>Rituximab in the treatment of secondary-progressive multiple sclerosis</title><p><underline>C Perrone</underline><sup>1</sup>, I Berriosmorales<sup>1</sup>, B Beretich<sup>2</sup>, P Riskind<sup>1</sup>, C Ionete<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA, United States, <sup>2</sup>Maine Medical Center, Portland, ME, United States</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> While mitoxantrone is the only FDA-approved drug to treat secondary-progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS), its use is limited by high toxicity. A safer and more effective therapy is needed. With a growing understanding of B cell involvement in SPMS pathophysiology and safety demonstrated in phase I and phase II studies for relapsing-remitting MS, targeting this cell population with rituximab may alter the disease course.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> The goal of this study is to evaluate clinical outcomes in SPMS patients treated with rituximab compared to a control group.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), 25-ft walk, and nine-hole peg test scores were evaluated for 40 SPMS patients treated with rituximab and a control group of 40 SPMS patients, matched for age and disease duration, on second-line immunosuppressive agents. Progression was first observed with respect to EDSS and composite scores. The differences in EDSS at -2, -1, +1, and +2 years relative to rituximab initiation were compared to differences over a 4-year follow-up period for control patients. To account for dilutional effects, patients on rituximab were also grouped by response (improvement, stable, progression). Mean differences between time periods were compared using a one-way, multiple comparison ANOVA. MRI data and adverse reactions were monitored for safety of the treatments.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The control group showed greater interval progression when compared to patients treated with rituximab after 2 years (p=0.0162). Subgroup analysis demonstrated that 45% of patients improved on rituximab. With an additional 38% demonstrating stability, over 80% of patients on rituximab achieved the goals of disease-modifying therapy, halting progression and promoting improvement. After two years of rituximab therapy, patients with stability or improvement had significantly lower EDSS scores relative to patients in the control cohort and non-responders who progressed. No changes in MRI activity were observed for patients through their course of treatment, except for one non-enhancing lesion in one patient, and the adverse reactions reported were only mild to moderate.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> B cell depletion through rituximab use could have important therapeutic benefit for SPMS patients. However, our results suggest the need for more prospective randomized controlled trials using B cell depletion therapies, including investigation into a biomarker for detection of clinical response.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section583-1352458514546077"><title>P287</title><sec id="section584-1352458514546077"><title>Efficacy of Natalizumab extended dosing in multiple sclerosis: a retrospective multicenter analysis</title><p><underline>L Zhovtis Ryerson</underline><sup>1</sup>, J Herbert<sup>1</sup>, C Tornatore<sup>2</sup>, J Foley<sup>3</sup>, B Weinstock-Guttman<sup>4</sup>, I Kister<sup>1</sup>, K Pandey<sup>5</sup>, D Hojnacki<sup>4</sup>, G Remington<sup>6</sup>, T Frohman<sup>6</sup>, E Major<sup>7</sup>, D Douek<sup>8</sup>, S Qureshi<sup>6</sup>, J Beh<sup>6</sup>, D Okuda<sup>6</sup>, P Utomo<sup>1</sup>, T Hoyt<sup>3</sup>, E Chamot<sup>9</sup>, M Bucello<sup>4</sup>, I Ahsan<sup>4</sup>, C Kolb<sup>4</sup>, E Frohman<sup>6</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>NYU Langone Medical Center, New York, NY, United States, <sup>2</sup>Georgetown University Hospital, Neurology, Washington, DC, United States, <sup>3</sup>Rocky Mountain MS Clinic, Salt Lake City, UT, United States, <sup>4</sup>University of Buffalo, Neurology, Buffalo, NY, United States, <sup>5</sup>Barnabas Health MS Center, Neurology, Livingston, NJ, United States, <sup>6</sup>University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Neurology, Dallas, TX, United States, <sup>7</sup>National Institute of Neurological Disease and Stroke, Bethesda, MD, United States, <sup>8</sup>National Institute of Allergy and Immunology, Bethesda, MD, United States, <sup>9</sup>University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL, United States</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Natalizumab (NTZ) is a highly-effective agent approved for the management of relapsing forms of Multiple Sclerosis (MS). However, its use is limited by susceptibility of NTZ-treated patients to a serious viral disease of the central nervous system (CNS) - Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML). In an attempt to mitigate risk of PML we have begun to explore the effect of extended dosing schedules (ED) for NTZ. We hypothesize that less frequent NTZ dosing may result in sub-maximal &#x003b1;4&#x003b2;1-integrin receptor saturation, adequate to exclude autoreactive T cells from entry into CNS (&#x02018;MS-protective&#x02019;) but nevertheless sufficiently permissive to enable normal CNS lymphocyte scavenging of JC-virus to occur (&#x02018;PML-protective&#x02019;).</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To investigate efficacy of various duration NTZ ED schedules.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> We conducted a retrospective review of charts and MRI scans of NTZ-treated patients from 6 U.S. MS centers. Patients were stratified into 4 groups based on NTZ treatment schedule after an initial 6-month initiation period with q4wk infusion: (1) group 1 - standard dosing (SD) every 4 weeks from onset; (2) group 2 (n= 222) - early extended dosing (EED) q4w3d-6w6d; (3) group 3 (n=221)- late extended dosing (LED) q7 - 8.5wks; (4) group 4 (n=158) - variable extended dosing (VED) - includes patients who alternated between EED and LED, in any sequence. For each group we calculated adjusted annualized relapse rate (ARR), incidence of steroid usage, new T2 lesions, T1 enhancing lesions, and disease free rate (No Evidence of Disease Activity, NEDA).</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> ARR for all ED groups (groups 2-4) remained remarkably low (0. 08 - 0.18), comparable to SD (group 1) and to those reported in 2 pivotal NTZ studies and the TOPS post-marketing database. Discontinuation rate for total ED cohorts was 32%, primarily due to safety concerns. NEDA including both clinical and MRI criteria ranged from 49% in VED, 57% in EED to 77% in LED. AAR and NEDA were significantly better in LED compared to EED and VED, possibly reflecting selection bias.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Following an initial NTZ q4wks initiation period for at least 6 months, ED of NTZ up to q8.5wks appears to maintain the excellent efficacy profile of the drug both clinically and radiologically. Further efficacy and safety monitoring in these cohorts are ongoing. A large prospective study of ED NTZ schedules in MS is warranted.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section585-1352458514546077"><title>P288</title><sec id="section586-1352458514546077"><title>Comparative efficacy of switch to natalizumab or fingolimod in active relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis</title><p><underline>T Kalincik</underline><sup>1,2</sup>, D Horakova<sup>3</sup>, T Spelman<sup>2</sup>, V Jokubaitis<sup>1</sup>, M Trojano<sup>4</sup>, A Lugaresi<sup>5</sup>, G Izquierdo<sup>6</sup>, C Rozsa<sup>7</sup>, P Grammond<sup>8</sup>, R Alroughani<sup>9</sup>, P Duquette<sup>10</sup>, M Girard<sup>10</sup>, E Pucci<sup>11</sup>, J Lechner-Scott<sup>12</sup>, M Slee<sup>13</sup>, R Fernandez-Bolanos<sup>6</sup>, F Grand&#x02019;Maison<sup>14</sup>, R Hupperts<sup>15</sup>, F Verheul<sup>16</sup>, S Hodgkinson<sup>17</sup>, C Oreja-Guevara<sup>18</sup>, D Spitaleri<sup>19</sup>, M Barnett<sup>20</sup>, M Terzi<sup>21</sup>, R Bergamaschi<sup>22</sup>, P McCombe<sup>23</sup>, J Sanchez-Menoyo<sup>24</sup>, M Simo<sup>25</sup>, T Csepany<sup>26</sup>, G Rum<sup>27</sup>, C Boz<sup>28</sup>, E Havrdova<sup>3</sup>, H Butzkueven<sup>1</sup>, MSBase Study Group</p><p><sup>1</sup>University of Melbourne, Department of Medicine, Melbourne, Australia, <sup>2</sup>Royal Melbourne Hospital, Department of Neurology, Melbourne, Australia, <sup>3</sup>Charles University in Prague, Prague, Czech Republic, <sup>4</sup>University of Bari, Bari, Italy, <sup>5</sup>University &#x02018;G. d&#x02019;Annunzio, Chieti, Italy, <sup>6</sup>Hospital Universitario Virgen Macarena, Sevilla, Spain, <sup>7</sup>Jahn Ferenc Teaching Hospital, Budapest, Hungary, <sup>8</sup>Hotel-Dieu de Levis, Quebec, QC, Canada, <sup>9</sup>Amiri Hospital, Kuwait, Kuwait, <sup>10</sup>H&#x000f4;pital Notre Dame, Montreal, QC, Canada, <sup>11</sup>Ospedale di Macerata, Macerata, Italy, <sup>12</sup>John Hunter Hospital, Newcastle, Australia, <sup>13</sup>Flinders University and Medical Centre, Adelaide, Australia, <sup>14</sup>H&#x000f4;pital Charles LeMoyne, Quebec, QC, Canada, <sup>15</sup>Orbis Medical Center, Sittard, Netherlands, <sup>16</sup>Groen Hart Ziekenhuis, Gouda, Netherlands, <sup>17</sup>Liverpool Hospital, Liverpool, Australia, <sup>18</sup>University Hospital San Carlos, Madrid, Spain, <sup>19</sup>AORN San Giuseppe Moscati, Avellino, Italy, <sup>20</sup>Brain and Mind Research Institute, Sydney, Australia, <sup>21</sup>19 Mayis University, Samsun, Turkey, <sup>22</sup>National Neurological Institute C.

However, no studies have directly compared the outcomes of escalation to either of these two agents.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To compare treatment outcomes between escalation to natalizumab or fingolimod due to active multiple sclerosis (MS) on injectable immunomodulatory agents.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Using MSBase, an international, observational MS registry, we identified patients with relapsing-remitting MS experiencing on-treatment relapses or disability progression within the 6 months preceding escalation to natalizumab or fingolimod. Propensity score matching (variable 1:6 ratio, nearest neighbour matching without replacement, caliper 0.1) was used to select sub-populations with similar baseline demographic and clinical characteristics. In order to eliminate attrition bias, pairwise censoring was applied. Relapse and disability outcomes were compared in paired analyses adjusted for baseline MRI.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Among the 792 included non-matched patients, escalation to natalizumab was associated with more severe disability, more frequent relapses, younger age and country of residence at baseline compared to fingolimod. The matched subsets of 407 (natalizumab) and 171 (fingolimod) patients did not differ in the recorded baseline parameters. Mean on-study follow-up was 12 months. The annualised relapse rates decreased from 1.5 to 0.2 on natalizumab and from 1.3 to 0.4 on fingolimod, with 50% relative post-switch difference in relapse hazard (p&#x0003c; 0.001). The changes in disability burden (quantified as area under disability-time curve) were -0.12 on natalizumab and 0.04 on fingolimod (Expanded Disability Status Scale step/year, p=0.002). The rate of 6-month confirmed disability regression was 67% higher after switch to natalizumab versus fingolimod (p=0.03) with no difference in the rate of 6-month confirmed disability progression.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> In patients with active MS during treatment with injectable disease modifying therapies, escalation to natalizumab or fingolimod leads to significantly decreased relapse rates. Patients escalating to natalizumab are relatively less likely to experience on-treatment relapses. Switch to natalizumab increases the probability of reduction of disability compared to fingolimod and may lead to decrease in the overall disability burden. The probability of disability progression events is similar between the two escalation strategies.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section587-1352458514546077"><title>P289</title><sec id="section588-1352458514546077"><title>Persistence with fingolimod versus dimethyl fumarate in patients with multiple sclerosis: retrospective analysis of US open source pharmacy data</title><p><underline>N Bergvall</underline><sup>1</sup>, R Lahoz<sup>1</sup>, T Nazareth<sup>2</sup>, JR Korn<sup>3</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Novartis Pharma AG, Basel, Switzerland, <sup>2</sup>Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, East Hanover, NJ, United States, <sup>3</sup>IMS Health, Waltham, MA, United States</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Persistence with disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) improves clinical outcomes in multiple sclerosis (MS).

Patients with &#x0003e;=1 prescription for fingolimod or DMF between 1 April 2013 and 31 July 2013 were included (index DMT). Patients were at least 18 years old, were naive to fingolimod and DMF, and had not received multiple DMTs on the date of first index DMT claim (index date). Prescription records were collected from pharmacies that had supplied at least 1 claim for index DMT between the first month from the index date and the last month of follow-up. Persistence was assessed as the time from initiating index DMT until discontinuation (a gap of &#x0003e;=60 days), receipt of another DMT or the end of the 6-month follow-up period. The risk of discontinuing index DMT was assessed using a Cox proportional hazards model controlling for age, gender, and region, and time to index DMT discontinuation was estimated using a Kaplan-Meier analysis.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The study included 9546 patients (fingolimod: n=1390; DMF: n=8156). The proportion of patients discontinuing index DMT was significantly lower for patients taking fingolimod (23.3%) compared with those taking DMF (36.6%; <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c; 0.0001). The risk of discontinuation was 1.6-fold higher in patients taking DMF compared with those taking fingolimod (hazard ratio, 95% confidence intervals: 1.58, 1.41-1.77; <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c; 0.0001) and time to discontinuation was significantly longer with fingolimod compared with DMF (<italic>p</italic>&#x0003c; 0.0001).

The reported mean annual rate of age-related BVL in healthy individuals (HIs) is 0.1-0.3%, whereas in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS), mean annual BVL is accelerated (0.5-1.35%). However, BVL is omitted from the current composite measures of disease activity and progression in RRMS, which rely on focal lesion-, relapse- and disability-related measures. Inclusion of BVL should provide a more comprehensive and stringent definition of disease-activity-free (DAF) or no evidence of disease activity (NEDA) for the assessment of treatment success.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To evaluate a range of BVL thresholds using data from a population of patients with relapsing MS pooled from two 2-year, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trials (FREEDOMS and FREEDOMS II) in order to identify an appropriate BVL cut-off for inclusion in a revised DAF definition.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Percentage brain volume change (PBVC) from baseline to month 24 was assessed with Structural Image Evaluation, using Normalization, of Atrophy (SIENA). Different BVL thresholds were specified across mean ranges reported in HIs and MS patients (annual PBVC, &#x02212;0.2%, &#x02212;0.4%, &#x02212;0.6%, &#x02212;1.0%, and &#x02212;1.2%). Among those in the pooled patient population with BVL above these thresholds, the proportions receiving fingolimod 0.5 mg (n = 783) or placebo (n = 773) were compared.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> In the pooled population, the mean annual PBVC with fingolimod was &#x02212;0.43% (standard deviation [SD], 0.65%; median, &#x02212;0.35%) compared with &#x02212;0.66% with placebo (SD, 0.77%; median &#x02212;0.51%; <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001). Irrespective of the chosen threshold, more fingolimod- than placebo-treated patients had BVL that remained below the threshold tested (PBVC threshold: % patients fingolimod vs placebo; &#x02212;0.2%: 29.1% vs 20.0%; &#x02212;0.4%: 37.2% vs 26.7%; &#x02212;0.6%: 45.4% vs 32.8%; &#x02212;1.0%: 61.6% vs 49.8%; &#x02212;1.2%: 66.3% vs 55.5%; all <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> This analysis provides BVL thresholds from which a candidate may be selected to allow more stringent differentiation of patients categorized as DAF across treatment groups.

In 1996 treatment with IFNb-1b 250 mcg was approved in Denmark. It was offered free to all MS-patients who fulfilled the same criteria as in the pivotal study: RRMS, age 18-55, EDSS &#x02264; 5.5, and at least two relapses in the preceding two years. All treated patients are registered in a permanent database, The Danish MS Treatment Register, and the Danish Civil Registration System which enables complete follow-up as to vital status for all the citizens at any time.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To test the validity of regression analyses and Propensity Score Matching (PSM) when comparing long-term survival in the two selected treatment cohorts of MS patients from different geographical locations.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Patients from the INFb-250 mcg arm of the NA pivotal study and patients from the Danish MS Treatment register who started INFb-250 mcg treatment in the period 1996-2001 were included. The NA follow-up was truncated at 18 years to match the maximum observation time of the Danish Cohort, and the Danish cohort was adjusted to the same age range as the NA patients.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> NA patients (N=124, 250mcg group) showed a survival numerically better than treated Danish patients (N=415): The hazard ratio (HR) for death (North Americans vs. Danes) was 0.56 (95% CI 0.30-1.04; p=0.068). After adjusting for sex, age at start of therapy, duration of MS, MS Severity Score, and relapses in two years prior to treatment start, the Cox regression analyses changed nothing. PSM (&#x0201c;nearest neighbour&#x0201d; 1:1 matching&#x0201d;; exact for sex) increased the difference with a HR for survival of 0.421 in favor of the NA group (95% CI 0.20-0.88; p=0.022).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Cox Regression analysis and PSM, adjusted for possible clinical and demographic confounders, failed to remove an apparent but probably non-existing biological difference in treatment effect in terms of survival between the cohorts.

However, there are only few data on its long-term impact and consequences of its discontinuation.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To investigate the long-term clinical outcomes of patients with MS who started natalizumab soon after the authorization by the Italian Pharmaceutical Agency.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Data on patients having a 6-year follow-up after starting natalizumab were collected. They were divided into 3 groups: continuing, temporarily interrupting (for at least 3 months) or discontinuing treatment. Logistic regression analyses were performed to ascertain the effect of final treatment status on the odds of either 1-step increase (disability worsening) and 1-step decrease (disability reduction) in Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score, controlling by baseline patients&#x02019; characteristics.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 378 patients (259 F, 119 M) with mean (SD) age of 35.1 (8.9), and median EDSS score of 3.0 (range: 1.0-7.0) were considered. Continuing, temporarily interrupting and discontinuing groups accounted for 125 (34%), 75 (20%) and 170 (46%) patients, respectively; 8 patients were lost to follow-up. Safety concerns for PML risk mainly led to discontinuation (110) and temporary interruption (66) of natalizumab.</p><p>Disability worsening was observed in 8 (6%) continuing, 17 (23%) temporarily interrupting, and 66 (39%) discontinuing patients. Disability reduction was observed in 37 (30%) continuing, 15 (20%) temporarily interrupting, and 12 (7%) discontinuing patients.</p><p>Discontinuing and interrupting patients were 9.3 and 4.3 times more likely to experience disability worsening than continuing ones (p&#x0003c; 0.001 and p=0.001, respectively); discontinuation implied a 2.2-fold increased risk of disability worsening even respect to temporary interruption (p=0.015).</p><p>Discontinuing patients were less likely to experience disability reduction than continuing (OR=0.21, p&#x0003c; 0.001) and temporarily interrupting ones (OR=0.35, p=0.014). Finally, the odds of disability reduction did not differ between continuing and temporarily interrupting patients (p=0.21).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our findings support the notion of high and sustained clinical effectiveness of ongoing natalizumab treatment. Either discontinuation and temporary interruption make patients at risk of disability worsening; however, temporary treatment interruption did not preclude the occurrence of disability reduction.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section595-1352458514546077"><title>P293</title><sec id="section596-1352458514546077"><title>Real life use of natalizumab and fingolimod in Austria: benefit-risk data from the Austrian Multiple Sclerosis Treatment Registry</title><p><underline>M Guger</underline><sup>1</sup>, C Enzinger<sup>2</sup>, F Leutmezer<sup>3</sup>, J Kraus<sup>4</sup>, T Berger<sup>5</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>General Hospital Linz, Department of Neurology and Psychiatry, Linz, Austria, <sup>2</sup>Medical University of Graz, Department of Neurology, Graz, Austria, <sup>3</sup>Medical University of Vienna, Department of Neurology, Vienna, Austria, <sup>4</sup>Paracelsus Medical University of Salzburg, Department of Neurology, Salzburg, Austria, <sup>5</sup>Innsbruck Medical University, Clinical Department of Neurology, Innsbruck, Austria</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> High efficacy of Natalizumab and Fingolimod in the treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS) has been proven in randomized trials. However, such trials do not necessarily reflect real-life situations faced in everyday practice.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> The Austrian MS Treatment Registry (AMSTR), established in 2006 and extended in 2011 to maintain quality control and comply with reimbursement regulations of the Austrian sick funds, allows to obtain such data, to assess indications, the clinical profiles of the treated populations and to monitor safety in a real life setting.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> The baseline documentation within the AMSTR includes duration of disease, relapses within the last 12 months, EDSS, MRI activity and previous disease modifying therapies. Entry of follow up data (relapses, EDSS, adverse events) is required at 3 months intervals.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> As of April 23<sup>rd</sup> 2014, the registry comprised 1208 patients treated with Natalizumab (70.3% female) and 312 patients treated with Fingolimod (71.8% female). At baseline, their mean age was 35.6 (16-67) years in the Natalizumab and 38.3 (18-64) years in the Fingolimod group, with disease durations of 7.8 (0-40) years and 8.9 (0-32) years, respectively. The relapse rate in the year before start of respective drugs was 2.3 with Natalizumab and 1.8 with Fingolimod. For those treated for at least one year, the subsequent annualized relapse rates decreased to 0.35 (Natalizumab) and 0.40 (Fingolimod). At baseline, the EDSS was 3.2 (0-8.5) in the Natalizumab and 2.6 (0-7.5) in the Fingolimod treated group. EDSS stabilization or improvement was observed in 85% (Natalizumab) and 78% (Fingolimod). 40% of Natalizumab patients and 41% of the patients receiving Fingolimod stopped therapy according to the following reasons - patient&#x02019;s wish, adverse events (AEs), continuing disease activity, pregnancy or intended pregnancy.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> For more than 7 years, the AMSTR has proved valuable to measure quality of care and monitor treatment, providing neurologists with highly relevant information for clinical practice. Continuous optimization and extension of this registry represents an unanimous goal and necessity. The availability of an increasingly broad treatment armamentarium with its consequences for daily practice (e.g. monitoring long-term benefit/risk profiles of individual drugs but also of their sequential use) emphasizes the need and the crucial importance of this registry for improved real life management of MS patients in Austria.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section597-1352458514546077"><title>P294</title><sec id="section598-1352458514546077"><title>Comparison of dropout rates of disease modifying therapies in multiple sclerosis</title><p><underline>M Kurtuncu</underline><sup>1</sup>, S Yildiz Celik<sup>1</sup>, A Coban<sup>1</sup>, E Shugaiv<sup>1</sup>, M Pehlivan<sup>1</sup>, G Akman-Demir<sup>2</sup>, M Eraksoy<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Istanbul University Istanbul Medical Faculty, Neurology, Istanbul, Turkey, <sup>2</sup>Istanbul Bilim University, Neurology, Istanbul, Turkey</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> There is an obvious need for head-to-head treatment studies in multiple sclerosis (MS). The lack of drug comparison trials may at least be partially compensated by real-life experience.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> The adherence of disease modifying treatments (DMT) depends not only on the side effects but also on the effect of a particular drug. Therefore, we can postulate that the treatment durations may give a reflection on the effectiveness of DMTs.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> All MS patients with a DMT in a large database of 7300 patients with a demyelinating disease were included in the study. Cox&#x02019;s proportional hazards analysis was performed to assess the impact of several covariates such as gender, disease duration, age of onset, age at the starting of the treatment, body mass index (BMI), oligoclonal band status, and treatment choices on the duration of treatments.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 1805 MS patients (1670 female, 702 male) were included in the study. The number of patients exposed to DMTs were as follows: 525 patients with interferon (IFN) beta1-a i.m., 494 patients with IFN beta1-b s.c., 590 patients with IFN beta1-a s.c., 442 patients with glatiramer acetate (GA) s.c., 139 patients with natalizumab, and 182 patients with fingolimod. According to the Cox regression analysis, only the treatment choice made a unique statistically significant effect on the treatment duration (p&#x0003c; 0,01) with IFN beta1-a i.m. having the highest dropout rate. Compared to IFN beta1-a i.m., the hazard ratios of the DMTs are as follows: IFN beta1-b s.c. 0,45 (95% CI 0,28-0,73; p=0,001), GA 0,53 (95% CI 0,33-0,85; p=0,009), IFN beta1-a s.c. 0,56 (95% CI 0,36-0,88; p=0,012), fingolimod 0,50 (95% CI 0,15-1,70; p=0,3), natalizumab 0,18 (95% CI 0,06-0,60; p=0,005). Subgroup analysis revealed that BMI had a significant impact on the treatment duration of GA with a hazard ratio of 0,89 (95% CI 0,79-0,60; p=0,99) without any effect to the treatment durations of other DMTs.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> This long term, real-life study clearly shows that the dropout rates differ between DMTs. Despite the fact that natalizumab is used mostly in treatment refractory MS patients, its dropout rate is much less than the first line DMTs. Interestingly, BMI may affect the treatment duration of GA with higher dropout rates in underweight patients.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section599-1352458514546077"><title>P295</title><sec id="section600-1352458514546077"><title>Consensus opinion of US neurologists on practice patterns in radiologically and clinically isolated syndrome and relapsing-remitting MS</title><p><underline>C Tornatore</underline><sup>1</sup>, JT Phillips<sup>2</sup>, O Khan<sup>3</sup>, A Miller<sup>4</sup>, A Ally<sup>5</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Georgetown University, Washington, DC, United States, <sup>2</sup>Baylor Research Institute, Dallas, TX, United States, <sup>3</sup>Wayne State University, Detroit, MI, United States, <sup>4</sup>Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, NY, United States, <sup>5</sup>CVS Caremark Inc., Woonsocket, RI, United States</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> A robust, up-to-date treatment algorithm for multiple sclerosis (MS) based on class I evidence has not been established. Appropriate management and selection of therapy is critical to optimize patient benefit.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> A modified Delphi process was used to assess practice patterns of recognized experts in the management and treatment of patients with MS or signs and symptoms suggestive of MS.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> MS specialists from the Consortium of Multiple Sclerosis Centers (CMSC) were invited to participate. A steering committee of MS experts developed 2 surveys assessing treatment practices and factors influencing treatment decisions, administered between December 2013 and April 2014. They included patient scenarios detailing key clinical and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings. Consensus opinion was defined a priori as 75% agreement.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> From geographically diverse US academic (49%) and community (51%) treatment centers, 107 respondents completed the first survey. Overall, there were 43 (46%) points of consensus, 21 of which were related to use of MRI. In all patient scenarios presented, there was consensus on when to initiate treatment but not on choice of therapy. A trend toward earlier, more aggressive treatment was observed: 70% would initiate treatment in a radiologically isolated syndrome case if 1 gadolinium-enhancing lesion was observed; 73% would treat clinically silent, but MRI-defined active disease in a patient with relapsing-remitting MS. Over 99% recommended a follow-up MRI within 12 months of presentation irrespective if treatment was initiated or not. In clinically stable RRMS patients, a change of therapy would be considered on the appearance of a single new Gd+ lesion (56%) or 2-4 T2 lesions (65%); there was consensus for continuing therapy in RRMS patients who remain stable by clinical and MRI measures for 5 years. Differences in opinion were observed regarding the best options for transitioning between treatments and duration of washout (except for the consensus that no washout is required for interferons and glatiramer acetate).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> These compelling findings show considerable conformity in treatment practices among US physicians who are adopting a more aggressive approach to early treatment of MS, although variations in therapy selections are potentially influenced by payer formulary coverage. The completed consensus guidelines may offer key insights into harmonizing MS care without increasing overall healthcare cost.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section601-1352458514546077"><title>P296</title><sec id="section602-1352458514546077"><title>Assessing tolerability of interferon beta-1a intramuscular injections with a 30 gauge needle</title><p>AC Neal<sup>1</sup>, LO Tuttle<sup>1</sup>, JA Ruiz<sup>1</sup>, BM Anderson<sup>1</sup>, <underline>PB Wade</underline><sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Mount Sinai Rehabilitation Hospital, Mandell Center for Multiple Sclerosis, Hartford, CT, United States</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Interferon Beta-1a (IFNB-1a) is routinely prescribed to persons with multiple sclerosis (PwMS). Clinicians have an option for choosing the needle gauge (G) for intramuscular injection when prescribing IFNB-1a. Options include 23G, 25G or 30G, with the 30G having the smallest diameter. In 2008, Freedman et al reported a decrease in anxiety and pain using 25G versus 23G needles for IFNB-1a injection. No studies have examined patient perception of 30G needles for IFNB-1a injection. <bold>Hypothesis:</bold> PwMS will report less pain and anxiety using 30G compared to 25G needles for IFNB-1a injection.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To evaluate perceived anxiety, pain and tolerability of the 30G needle for IFNB-1a injection.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Twenty patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis using IFNB-1a with a 25G needle as part of routine care without prior use of a 30G needle were enrolled in this five week study. Participants self administered their normal dose of IFNB-1a weekly at home, alternating thighs, and filled out questionnaires pre and post injections. Week 1, participants used their own 25G needle and practiced completing the questionnaires; this data was not analyzed. Participants were provided 30G needles for weeks 2 and 3 and 25G for weeks 4 and 5. Participants were blinded to needle G. Pre-injection outcomes included Visual Analog Scales (VAS) for anxiety and pain and a Fear of Injection Questionnaire (FIQ). Post-injection outcomes included VAS pain, VAS anxiety and a Perception of Needle Questionnaire (PNQ). Data were analyzed using Wilcoxon Signed Ranks tests in SPSS version 18.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Participants were 75% female, with a mean age of 48.60&#x000b1;10.41 years (yr), disease duration of 13.00 &#x000b1;7.86 yr, and length of time on IFNB-1a of 9.70 &#x000b1;6.28 yr. Mean VAS pre-injection anxiety was significantly higher for the 30G needle (M=2.28 cm, SD=2.73) than the 25G needle (M=1.58 cm, SD=2.25), p=0.030. There was no difference in fear of injection.

The actual therapeutic landscape consists of the disease-modifying drugs (DMD) that act by reducing the inflammatory activity but conflicting results exist on their effect on disability in the long term.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> The aims of this study were to understand the effect of common DMD in the long-term risk of disability and whether the effect is related to disability at start of treatment.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> We analysed a cohort of 3060 patients from the MS Clinic of Cagliari (Italy) database. The median time of the follow-up was 12 years, accounting for 42025 person-years. Disability was assessed using the EDSS. Complete data on therapy were available for 2516 individuals. Among these patients, 1429 were treated with immunomodulants (IMT), 165 were treated with immunosuppressants (IST), 385 were treated with both, and 537 were not treated (UT). The median duration of treatment was 6.0 years. The effect of therapy on progression to EDSS 3 and EDSS 6 from onset was analysed in treated <italic>vs</italic> untreated patients using Cox regression analysis adjusted for propensity score and immortal time bias.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The risks of EDSS 3 were 94% (HR= 0.06, p&#x0003c; 0.001) and 73% (HR= 0.27, p&#x0003c; 0.001) lower in 1306 IMT patients and in 98 IST patients, respectively, than in untreated patients. The risk of EDSS 6 in 1389 IMT patients was 86% lower than in UT (HR= 0.14, CI 95% 0.08-0.25, p&#x0003c; 0.001), whereas in 140 IST patients, the risk did not significantly differ. The risk of EDSS 6, analysed in 1275 IMT patients before they progressed to EDSS 3 was 91% lower than in 539 UT (HR= 0.09, 95% CI 0.04-0.19, p&#x0003c; 0.001). Similarly, in 114 patients who started IMT after they progressed to EDSS 3, the risk was 75% lower than in UT (HR= 0.25, 95% CI 0.12-0.51, p&#x0003c; 0.001). The risk of EDSS 6 was higher in patients who started therapy after EDSS 3 than in patients who started therapy before EDSS 3 (HR= 4.42, 95% CI 2.64-7.39, p&#x0003c; 0.001).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> These results demonstrate, despite the observational design of this study, a benefit of common DMD in delaying long-term disability in MS patients treated either in the early or, to a lesser extent, in the later phase of the disease. Thus, the window of therapeutic opportunity is relatively extended, assuming that early treatment is better than late treatment, but late treatment is better than never.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section605-1352458514546077"><title>P298</title><sec id="section606-1352458514546077"><title>Safety and efficacy of treosulfan in 21 patients with active secondary progressive multiple sclerosis after treatment with mitoxantrone</title><p><underline>A Dei&#x000df;</underline><sup>1</sup>, S Br&#x000e4;uninger<sup>1</sup>, H Wiendl<sup>2</sup>, M Buttmann<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>University of W&#x000fc;rzburg, Department of Neurology, W&#x000fc;rzburg, Germany, <sup>2</sup>University of M&#x000fc;nster, Department of Neurology, M&#x000fc;nster, Germany</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Immunotherapy of patients with active secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS), after having reached the maximal cumulative dose of mitoxantrone, represents a therapeutic challenge. Treosulfan, a well-tolerated alkylating agent approved for ovarian cancer, was previously found to be effective and safe in 11 patients with active SPMS in a non-randomised, open-label trial. However, none of these patients had previously received immunosuppressive therapy.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To report on 21 patients with active SPMS, who received treosulfan in a clinical routine setting after previous treatment with mitoxantrone.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Retrospective single center case series.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Fourteen patients (67%) were women. At treosulfan initiation, mean age was 46 (SD 10.6, range 26-69) years. Ten patients had SPMS without and 11 with superimposed relapses. Mean time since diagnosis was 13.5 (SD 6.1) years. Median duration of the secondary progressive phase was 5 (range 1-22) years. All patients had previously received mitoxantrone (mean cumulative dose 97.2 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, SD 36.9). All had clinically active disease as assessed by EDSS progression, clinical relapses and MRI activity markers. Median EDSS at baseline was 6.5 (range 4.0-8.0). Most often, treosulfan was intravenously administered at a standard dose of 7 g/m<sup>2</sup> for 4 monthly cycles, followed by quarterly infusions &#x02212; with dose adjustments according to blood counts (mean 6.7 cycles, SD 2.8; mean cumulative dose 45.5 g/m<sup>2</sup>, SD 21.2). An improvement of the EDSS score during treosulfan treatment was observed in 2 patients, EDSS stability was noted in 15 patients and 3-month sustained EDSS progression was seen in 4 patients. Treatment of 2 patients had to be stopped due to serious adverse events, including urosepsis followed by deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism in one patient, as well as severe pneumonia requiring assisted ventilation in the other. Both patients fully recovered from these complications. Another patient&#x02019;s treatment was discontinued due to incompliance and suspected self-harming behaviour. Mostly mild to moderate adverse events leading to dose or interval alterations included leukocytopenia, thrombocytopenia and infections. No haematologic malignancy was observed (mean follow-up 44 months, SD 19.4). Overall, treatment with treosulfan was well tolerated.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Treosulfan could be considered as a rescue therapy in mitoxantrone-pretreated patients with active SPMS after stringent benefit-risk assessment.

Most interventions to improve medication adherence to date have relied on face-to-face contact. The relative rarity of the condition and need to travel great distances for specialist care suggests the need for remotely-administered interventions in this population. The feasibility of a remote behavioral intervention in this population has not been assessed, nor have rigorous evaluations of enrollment methods and retention of pediatric MS patients in behavioral intervention studies been performed.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To evaluate the feasibility of implementing a remote motivational interviewing (MI) intervention combined with web-based outcome measures in a pediatric MS patient population.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> We evaluated enrollment and retention at a single tertiary-care centre in a prospective trial of medication adherence in pediatric MS. Feasibility was assessed by examining patient recruitment, retention, intervention compliance and satisfaction, and completion of web-based questionnaires. We also evaluated strategies to retain and recruit trial participants. Recruitment strategies included pairing the enrollment visit with a clinic visit, minimizing travel distances by offering online questionnaires and a remote intervention, and offering a parking voucher. Retention strategies included building strong relationships with the study coordinator and staff, contact between study visits via email and telephone reminders, scheduling night and weekend appointments, and financial incentives. Ethics approval from SickKids&#x02019; Research Ethics Board was obtained.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Thirteen of 14 patients invited agreed to participate in the study. One patient withdrew due to psychiatric issues; two were ineligible, yielding a total of ten retained. Average commute to hospital was 78 minutes. All patients and parents were able to complete their respective initial web-based questionnaire, taking about 20 minutes to complete.

Phase 3 clinical trials established the efficacy and tolerability of both but the comparative efficacy, safety and tolerability of these medications is unknown.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To compare the real-world efficacy, safety, and tolerability of dimethyl fumarate (DMF) and fingolimod (FTY) in patients with MS.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Patients prescribed DMF or FTY at our center were identified. Patient and clinician-reported outcomes, MS disease history, prior DMT use, screening laboratory studies, relapse data, MRI data and follow-up data was abstracted and entered into a secure REDCap database. Propensity score methods based on clinical and imaging data were used to improve balance of baseline characteristics between the treatment groups, including both 1:1 Greedy matching without replacement and Average Treatment effect on the Treated (ATT) weighting approaches. Primary outcomes included discontinuation rate at 3 months for tolerability and proportion of patients with MRI activity or relapses by 3 month follow-up for efficacy.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> 426 patients initiated DMF therapy and 317 initiated FTY (total n=743). ATT weighting on the linear propensity score achieved better covariate balance compared to 1:1 matching and was used to obtain adjusted estimates for each outcome. Discontinuation of DMF occurred in 18% of subjects compared to 8% of those on FTY. Patients on DMF had a statistically significantly higher rate of drug discontinuation at 3 months (OR 3.43, 95% CI 1.69 to 6.97, p&#x0003c; 0.001) compared to FTY. The leading causes of discontinuation in DMF patients were gastro-intestinal and dermatological (flushing) symptoms. Patients on DMF showed a trend for higher odds of relapse in the first 3 months of therapy (OR 2.04, 95% CI 0.78 to 5.37, p,&#x0003e;0.05) when compared to FTY. There was no significant difference in rates of MRI activity between DMF and fingolimod patients at 3 months (OR 1.05, 95% CI 0.42 to 2.65, p&#x0003e;0.05).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Patients using DMF were three times more likely to discontinue medication than those starting FTY. Gastrointestinal and flushing symptoms adversely affected the overall tolerability of DMF. Efficacy was not statistically different between FTY and DMF at 3 months however the follow-up may be too short to detect a difference. The comparative efficacy and tolerability of FTY and DMF will need to be considered when using selecting between these medications.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section611-1352458514546077"><title>P301</title><sec id="section612-1352458514546077"><title>Suboptimal response to therapy in disease-free MS patients: a paradox?</title><p>FFA Figueira<sup>1</sup>, <underline>GMA Figueira</underline><sup>1</sup>, PV Soares<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Hospital S&#x000e3;o Francisco, Neurology, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Current MS therapies target inflammatory activity of disease, defined by clinical relapses and EDSS progression, besides with absent T1W contrast enhancing lesions as well as no new or enlarging T2W lesions on MRI, in a way to impact disability development. So, the absence of clinical and MRI activity are accepted paradigms of disease free status in treated patients. Nevertheless, axonal loss seems to be a major determinant of disability, and may occur with lacking clinical expression and sophisticated MRI requirements. In this paper, we discuss current concept of disease free applied in real world, and propose that measures of atrophy be used in daily practice as a tool for optimal therapy.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> Axonal loss is an early finding in MS and relates to disability. So we propose its use as a marker for treatment optimization.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Our group studied 206 consecutive non-selected patients with relapsing-remitting MS diagnosed according to 2001 McDonald criteria, on regular immunomodulatory treatment. They were submitted to serial clinical examinations and conventional MRI evaluation focus on relapses, EDSS progression and the presence of T1W Gd enhancing or T2W new/enlarging lesions. On conventional MRI sequences, we studied brain parenchymal fraction (BPF) and corpus callosum index (CCI), annually comparing results with data from a control group, composed by non-inflammatory diseases.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> After 5 year, 56.7% patients presented with some evidence of disease activity: all but two patients showed worsening scores in BPF and CCI. On the other hand, 43.2% fulfilled accepted criteria for free of disease status, despite 48.3% of them showed a progressive reduction on BPF and CCI, comparable with those stratified as suboptimal responders.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our data demonstrates that axonal loss can be detected on follow up using corpus callosum index using conventional MRI sequences, even among apparently stable patients. We propose this parameter to be included as one requirement for &#x0201c;disease free&#x0201d; patient concept.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section613-1352458514546077"><title>P302</title><sec id="section614-1352458514546077"><title>Patient-reported adverse events of high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone for relapse treatment in multiple sclerosis (FEEL study)</title><p><underline>I Stavrakaki</underline><sup>1</sup>, ELJ Hoogervorst<sup>2</sup>, P Pop<sup>3</sup>, E van Munster<sup>4</sup>, WHJP Linssen<sup>5</sup>, R Hupperts<sup>6</sup>, LGF Sinnige<sup>7</sup>, JJ Kragt<sup>8</sup>, WIM Verhagen<sup>9</sup>, LH Visser<sup>10</sup>, R van der Kruijk<sup>11</sup>, HM Schrijver<sup>12</sup>, J Koeman<sup>13</sup>, F Verheul<sup>14</sup>, JBS Boringa<sup>15</sup>, EPJ Arnoldus<sup>16</sup>, W Gladdines<sup>1</sup>, F L&#x000f6;nnqvist<sup>1</sup>, PJ Gaillard<sup>1</sup>, PJ Jongen<sup>17</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>to-BBB Technologies BV, Leiden, Netherlands, <sup>2</sup>St Antonius Ziekenhuis, Utrecht, Netherlands, <sup>3</sup>Viecuri Medisch Centrum, Venlo/Venray, Netherlands, <sup>4</sup>Jeroen Bosch Hospital, Den Bosch, Netherlands, <sup>5</sup>Sint Lucas Andreas Ziekenhuis, Amsterdam, Netherlands, <sup>6</sup>Orbis Medical Center, Sittard, Netherlands, <sup>7</sup>Medisch Centrum Leeuwarden, Leeuwarden, Netherlands, <sup>8</sup>Reinier de Graaf Groep, Delft, Netherlands, <sup>9</sup>Canisius-Wilhelmina Ziekenhuis, Nijmegen, Netherlands, <sup>10</sup>St. Elisabeth Ziekenhuis, Tilburg, Netherlands, <sup>11</sup>Slingeland Ziekenhuis, Doetinchem, Netherlands, <sup>12</sup>Westfriesgasthuis, Hoorn, Netherlands, <sup>13</sup>Admiraal De Ruyter Ziekenhuis, Goes, Netherlands, <sup>14</sup>Groene Hart Ziekenhuis, Gouda, Netherlands, <sup>15</sup>Meander Medisch Centrum, Amersfoort, Netherlands, <sup>16</sup>Tweesteden Ziekenhuis, Tilburg, Netherlands, <sup>17</sup>MS4 Research Institute, Nijmegen, Netherlands</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Pulses of high dose intravenous methylprednisolone (IVMP) 500-1000 mg/day for 3-5 days is the mainstay of relapse treatment in multiple sclerosis (MS). Despite IVMP being generally considered as well tolerated in this patient group, patient-reported adverse events (AEs) are scarcely studied.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> The FEEL study is an observational study designed to assess the frequency, severity and impact of patient-reported AEs during and shortly after IVMP treatment in patients with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) and clinically isolated syndrome (CIS).</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> 80 RRMS and CIS patients (median age 45 y) diagnosed with a relapse and planned to be treated with IVMP were enrolled at 15 hospitals in the Netherlands from January 2013 until 10 March 2014 (cut-off). The patients completed a questionnaire assessing the frequency, severity and impact of IVMP AEs on a 4-point Likert scale (a lot, quite a lot, a little, not at all) at 4 time points: before start of treatment, during treatment and 1 and 7 days after end of treatment. AEs were defined as any worsening of pre-existing symptom or the occurrence of any new symptom after start of treatment. AEs were considered as severe when one of the two highest points were chosen at least once. Preliminary data regarding frequency and severity from 60 patients (17 drop outs, 3 didn&#x02019;t complete baseline) who completed baseline and at least one follow up questionnaire are shown here.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Patients reported the following AEs: taste alteration (55%), facial flushing (53%), nausea/stomach pain (50%), insomnia (38%), agitation (33%), changes in appetite (32%), behavioral changes (30%), muscle weakness (28%), anger (27%), palpitations (27%), depression (22%), euphoric feelings (20%), acne (20%), skin changes (20%) and muscle cramps (17%). The median number of AEs per patient was 4 (range 0-12). The CNS-related AEs considered severe and experienced by at least 10% of the patients were insomnia (27%), agitation (18%) and depression (10%). As regards severe non-CNS-related AEs, nausea/stomach pain (20%), muscle weakness (20%), metallic taste (15%) and facial flushing (12%) were most commonly reported.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> MS patients treated with high-dose IVMP for a relapse experience a median number of 4 AEs during and shortly after treatment. Severe CNS-related and non-CNS-related AEs occur in up to 27% and 20% of the patients respectively, and add to the MS-related symptoms. These data show that from a patient perspective, there is room for improvement in the treatment of MS relapses.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section615-1352458514546077"><title>P303</title><sec id="section616-1352458514546077"><title>Safety and efficacy of dimethyl fumarate in patients with multiple sclerosis - real world experience</title><p><underline>C Chaves</underline><sup>1</sup>, R Ganguly<sup>1</sup>, C Dionne<sup>1</sup>, A Camac<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Lahey Clinic/Tufts University, Neurology, Lexington, MA, United States</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Dimethyl fumarate (DMF) is a new oral disease modifying agent (DMA) recently approved to treat relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). Its safety and efficacy were demonstrated in two phase III clinical trials. However, its benefit in real world MS patients is still not well known.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To report on the safety and efficacy of DMF in RRMS patients followed at the Lahey Clinic MS Center.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> We retrospectively selected all RRMS patients treated with DMF from our MS database. Potential side effects and number of clinical relapses were reviewed.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> We had 145 patients, 103 women (71%) and 42 men (29%), with a mean age of 49 years. Patients were followed for a median of 8.7 months. Side effects from prior DMA (43%) were the most frequent cause for starting DMF followed by lack of efficacy (23.5%) to other agents. The most common side effects were flushing and gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms. Flushing was reported by 57.3% of the patients in the first month of treatment, 34.6% by the 3<sup>rd</sup> month and 45 % and 71.4 % by the end of the 6<sup>th</sup> and 9<sup>th</sup> months. GI side effects occurred in 53% of patients in the first month, but declined to 18%, 13.9% and 10.7 % by the end of the 3<sup>rd</sup>, 6<sup>th</sup> and 9<sup>th</sup> months. Decrease in the number of white blood cells and/or lymphocyte counts were detected in 26.5%, 50.7% and 62% of patients at months 3, 6 and 9, with grade II leucopenia and/or grade III lymphopenia occurring in 2%, 4.5% and 6.9% patients, respectively. Five patients (3.4%) developed serious infections while on DMF, two of them in the setting of severe leucopenia and/or lymphopenia. Transaminitis was seen in 13.3% of patients at month 3, 19.4% at month 6 and 13.8% at month 9; all, except one, had levels below three times baseline. One patient (0.7 %) was diagnosed with adenocarcinoma of the lung during treatment. Eight patients (5.5%) had exacerbations within the first 7 months of starting DMF, four of them occurring within the first 3 months of treatment. DMF was discontinued in 23 patients (15.9%), the majority due to GI side effects followed by clinical relapse.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> In our study, the side effects from DMF were similar to phase III studies, however, flushing occurred more frequently and lasted longer than previously reported. In addition, decrease in white blood cell and/or lymphocyte count were detected in more than 50% of the patients, as many as 6.9% with severe abnormalities. During this study, 5.5% of patients had exacerbations, most of them within the first few months of treatment.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section617-1352458514546077"><title>P304</title><sec id="section618-1352458514546077"><title>Time to relapse among propensity score matched patients receiving disease modifying therapy for multiple sclerosis</title><p>BH Johnson<sup>1</sup>, MM Bonafede<sup>1</sup>, <underline>C Watson</underline><sup>2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Truven Health Analytics, Outcomes Research, Cambridge, MA, United States, <sup>2</sup>Biogen Idec Inc., HE&#x00026;OR, Global Market Access, Cambridge, MA, United States</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> A recent study conducted using multiple sclerosis (MS) registry data mainly from Europe found that natalizumab significantly delays time to relapse compared to platform therapy (interferon beta/glatiramer acetate) in patients who switch therapies.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To examine relapse rates and time to relapse among propensity score matched MS patients treating with platform therapy or natalizumab using United States administrative claims data.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Adults with a diagnosis of MS (ICD-9-CM code 340) receiving platform therapy or natalizumab between January 1, 2009 and April 1, 2012 were identified in the Truven Health MarketScan Research databases; the first claim was the index date. Patients were required to have 12 months of continuous enrollment before [pre-period], with no prior non-index MS therapy, and after [post-period] the index date and remain on their index drug for 12 months. Nearest neighbor propensity score matching was conducted on the probability of a patient receiving natalizumab, including the following match characteristics: age, gender, region, health plan type, index year, selected comorbid conditions and concomitant medications, MS severity, pre-period relapse and pre-period expenditures. Relapse was defined as the presence of an MS-related inpatient (IP) admission, IV or oral corticosteroid use during the 12 month post-period. Time to relapse was evaluated using a Cox Proportional Hazard model controlling for all available baseline demographic and clinical characteristics.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 882 natalizumab patients (mean age 45 years, 70% female) were matched 1:1 to 882 platform therapy patients (standardized difference &#x0003c; 10 on all matching measures).

Patient counseling programs (PCP) should not only help in the understanding of MS but also to stay adherent to a given therapy and follow medical recommendations.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To evaluate, whether an individualized PCP based on the statistical analysis of a patient survey to identify current adherence risk factors can improve adherence and provide an effective system to stay adherent.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> In an open-label survey, German MS patients completed an anonymous web-based questionnaire regarding adherence factors. 4000 patients were invited, 1883 participated. Statistical analysis consisted of contingency tables and Chi-Square test. In February 2014, the PCP based on these results for patients treated with dimethyl fumarate (DMF) including amongst others differentiated information for 3 patient subtypes and a smartphone application started. DMF patients which were not included in the PCP serve as controls.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Demographic parameters from the survey were comparable to the German MS-register. While 87% of these patients were currently treated with disease-modifying drugs, 35% stated to have problems with adherence. Demographic factors did not act as reliable parameter predicting adherence risk factors while experience with MS therapies did. There is a positive correlation with adherent behavior in patients having realistic expectations of therapeutic outcome, good self-management, and reliable information sources.</p><p>As of April 2014, 1701 DMF patients registered in the PCP. Approximately 75% of patients had experience with at least one therapy while the rest was newly diagnosed in both cohorts. The primary reason for transitioning to DMF in both groups was sensed ineffectiveness of prior therapy. Approximately a third of patients in the PCP reported adverse events (AE). Flushing was the most common AE, so far. Close contact between PCP and patients lead to effective AE management and most of the symptoms could be handled and improved. To retain adherence individual intake procedures were defined and the application with a reminder function was distributed.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Reduction of AEs and thereby initial adherence could be achieved by the individualized PCP. Qualitative and quantitative measurements of adverse effects reduction and adherence will show if this initial approach will also be useful for long-term adherence.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section621-1352458514546077"><title>P306</title><sec id="section622-1352458514546077"><title>Reduced frequency and severity of injection site reactions with glatiramer acetate 40mg/mL three times weekly dosing</title><p><underline>JS Wolinsky</underline><sup>1</sup>, Y Sidi<sup>2</sup>, JR Steinerman<sup>3</sup>, V Knappertz<sup>3,4</sup>, S Kolodny<sup>5</sup>, The GLACIER Study Group</p><p><sup>1</sup>University of Texas, Health Science Center at Houston, Houston, TX, United States, <sup>2</sup>Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, Netanya, Israel, <sup>3</sup>Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, Frazer, PA, United States, <sup>4</sup>Heinrich-Heine Universit&#x000e4;t D&#x000fc;sseldorf, D&#x000fc;sseldorf, Germany, <sup>5</sup>Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, Cleveland, OH, United States</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Injection site reactions (ISRs) are the most common treatment (Tx)-related adverse events (AEs) associated with subcutaneous glatiramer acetate (GA) use in RRMS patients (pts).

Pt-reported ISRs were recorded on a daily diary card and classified as mild (easily tolerated), moderate (interferes with normal daily activity), or severe (prevents normal daily activity). All ISRs occurring in the active Tx phase were coded to MedDRA-preferred terms. ISR frequency was measured as annualized event rate; ie, total number of ISR events/pt-yr of drug exposure.

Certain DMTs, such as dimethyl fumarate (DMF), interferon beta-1a (IFN-&#x003b2;1a), and interferon beta-1b (IFN-&#x003b2;1b), require titration to reduce the risk of side effects associated with treatment initiation before reaching the maintenance dose recommended in the product labels.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To assess neurologist-reported real-world titration periods and effectiveness of titration doses of DMF, IFN-&#x003b2;1a (intramuscular [IM] and subcutaneous [SC]), and IFN-&#x003b2;1b.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Forty US neurologists participated in this study. Respondents were blinded to the identity of the study sponsor. Neurologists practicing for at least 3 years and treating at least 10 patients with RRMS with an oral DMT in the past year were eligible for the study. Neurologists were provided a list of all DMTs requiring titration, and asked to provide the average duration for which their patients receive each pre-specified titration dose as well as their perceived effectiveness of each titration dose relative to the maintenance dose.

The perceived effectiveness of 120mg was reported to be 66% (&#x000b1;24%) of the maintenance dose (240mg). On average, IFN-&#x003b2;1a IM was titrated 15 to 17 days longer than recommended, with perceived effectiveness ranging between 46% and 63% of the maintenance dose.

Use of symptomatic therapy for GI events was permitted, but no specific therapies were recommended or evaluated for differential efficacy. Patients were prompted to record information about GI events daily using an eDiary device and two numerical rating scales, and returned to the study site at Weeks 4, 8, and 12 for safety assessments.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> 237 patients were enrolled; 233 were included in the safety population (78% female; mean age 47 &#x000b1; 12 years). The prevalence of eDiary-reported GI AEs in users of symptomatic therapy was highest during Weeks 1&#x02212;4 (45.5%) and declined thereafter (Weeks 5&#x02212;8, 27.9%; Weeks 9&#x02212;12, 18.0%). In general, a decrease in the average worst severity of GI-related events was seen in patients who received treatment with one or more medications in the following categories: bismuth subsalicylate, acid-secretion blockers (proton pump inhibitors, histamine type 2 receptor blockers), antidiarrheals (antiperistaltic agents), centrally acting antiemetics, and anti-bloating/anti-constipation agents.

The DRa1-MOG-35-55 construct reversed clinical and histological signs of EAE when administered after onset of disease signs and reduced infarct volumes when given 4 hours after MCAO.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> These data suggest a conformationally-sensitive determinant on DRa1-MOG that is responsible for optimal binding to CD74 and antagonism of MIF effects, resulting in reduced axonal damage and reversal of ongoing clinical and histological signs of EAE and reduced infarct volume in MCAO. These results demonstrate natural antagonist activity of DRa1 for MIF that was strongly potentiated by the MOG peptide extension, resulting in a novel therapeutic, DRa1-MOG-35-55, that within the limitations of the EAE and MCAO models may have the potential to treat subjects with MS and stroke without need for HLA screening.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section629-1352458514546077"><title>P311</title><sec id="section630-1352458514546077"><title>Strategies to reduce adverse events related to oral dimethyl fumarate</title><p><underline>C Sammarco</underline><sup>1</sup>, L Laing<sup>1</sup>, J Herbert<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>NYU Langone Multiple Sclerosis Care Center, Neurology, New York, NY, United States</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Oral dimethyl fumarate (DMF) is approved in the United States for the treatment of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS). In the Phase 3 DEFINE and CONFIRM studies, the most common adverse events associated with DMF included flushing and gastrointestinal (GI) events. For most patients, these events were mild or moderate in severity and decreased in incidence after the first month of treatment. In clinical practice, DMF-associated adverse events have been largely related to medication tolerability rather than serious safety concerns. Tolerability of a medication may affect adherence, which in turn may affect efficacy of the drug. However, tolerability-related adverse events of DMF can often be overcome with time. If adverse events due to tolerability are not managed early, appropriate patients may discontinue therapy prematurely.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To investigate the impact of a structured nursing initiation protocol (IP) on DMF adverse effects and adherence.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Immediately following introduction of DMF to the U.S. market, we initiated patients on DMF utilizing the standard pharmaceutical recommendations (PR-IP). Thereafter we developed a DMF Initiation Protocol (NYU-IP) that includes a modified titration schedule, pre-medication recommendations, specific dietary instructions, regular follow-up encounters and a variety of other educational measures to help patients manage DMF adverse effects. We conducted a retrospective review comparing DMF adherence following drug initiation utilizing NYU-IP and PR-IP.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 329 patients were initiated on DMF from March 2013 to January 2014, 124 patients using PR-IP (group 1) and 205 patients using the NYU-IP (group 2). Total discontinuations were 14 (12%) and 5 (2.5%) for groups 1 and 2, respectively (p = 0.0029). Discontinuations attributed to GI side effects were 10 (8%) and 4 (1.9%; p = 0.0215) respectively, and discontinuations due to flushing were 4 (3.2%) and 1 (0.5%; p=0.0733) respectively</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> A structured nursing protocol for initiation of DMF was highly effective in reducing adverse effects and maintaining adherence to DMF treatment. The specific components of the Initiation Protocol will be presented and discussed. Effective nursing strategies are key to optimizing treatment adherence and outcomes with DMF.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section631-1352458514546077"><title>P312</title><sec id="section632-1352458514546077"><title>Monthly pulse methylprednisolone as an add-on therapy is effective in long-term treatment of multiple sclerosis</title><p><underline>S Ozakbas</underline><sup>1</sup>, B Piri Cinar<sup>2</sup>, D Oz<sup>3</sup>, T Kahraman<sup>3</sup>, G Kosehasanogullari<sup>4</sup>, B Bircan Kursun<sup>3</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Dokuz Eylul University, Dept. of Neurology, Izmir, Turkey, <sup>2</sup>Giresun State Hospital, Giresun, Turkey, <sup>3</sup>Dokuz Eylul University, Izmir, Turkey, <sup>4</sup>Usak State Hospital, Usak, Turkey</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Although some conflicting results, there are some evidences for beneficial treatment effects of long-term pulsed intravenous methylprednisolone (IVMP) and combination of interferon beta (IFNB) and pulsed methylprednisolone in multiple sclerosis (MS), but more evidence are needed to establish clinical practice for such a treatment strategy.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To evaluated the efficacy of monthly pulse methylprednisolone treatment added to IFNBs or Glatiramer acetate (GA) in breakthrough MS.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> MS patients receiving ongoing IFNBs (IFNB 1b, IFNB 1a SC) treatment were eligible if they had Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores of 5.5 or less. Patients with at least two relapses or at least one relapse and new T2 or gadolinium- enhanced lesion within the previous year. Patients received 1 g pulse IVMP once a month at least one year. Each participant was evaluated within a 1-month window of scheduled 12-month visits. Outcomes included relapse rate (primary), EDSS and Multiple Sclerosis International Quality of Life (MUSIQoL) scores.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 91 RRMS patients were included in the study.

While the number of effective treatment options indicated for relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS) in the United States (US) has increased over the years, the utilization of disease-modifying therapy (DMT) for patients with SPMS versus RRMS is unknown.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To evaluate demographics and self-reported use of DMTs in a representative population of patients with RRMS and SPMS in the US.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Patient-reported data were derived from the Internet-based National Health and Wellness Survey (NHWS), a nationally representative annual survey of the healthcare attitudes and behaviors of adults &#x02265;18 years of age in the US. The study population included NHWS respondents who reported a diagnosis of RRMS or SPMS in 2012 (survey conducted March- August) or 2013 (survey conducted April- August). Only the more recent survey was counted for patients responding to both annual surveys. Demographic characteristics and DMT use were compared between patients with RRMS and SPMS using chi-square (categorical variables) and independent sample <italic>t</italic> (continuous variables) tests.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Across the 2012 and 2013 surveys, a total of 810 (0.6%) respondents reported a diagnosis of MS; 58.0% (n=458) had RRMS and 13.3% (n=105) had SPMS. Patients with RRMS compared with SPMS were younger (mean age 48.9 vs 55.7 years; <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c; 0.001) and a higher percentage were female (71.6% vs 56.2%; <italic>P</italic>=0.002). A lower percentage of patients with RRMS versus SPMS were Caucasian (79.3% vs 87.6%; <italic>P</italic>=0.05). DMTs used by patients with SPMS included glatiramer acetate (13.5%); intramuscular interferon beta-1a (10.6%); interferon beta-1b (8.7%); fingolimod (8.7%); natalizumab (6.7%); subcutaneous interferon beta-1a (1.0%); and teriflunomide (1.0%).

These differences between RRMS and SPMS patients highlight the unmet need for therapies specifically indicated for the treatment of patients with SPMS.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section635-1352458514546077"><title>P314</title><sec id="section636-1352458514546077"><title>Comparative analysis of drop-out rates during the first year of fingolimod versus natalizumab treatment in the Swedish IMSE registry</title><p>T Frisell<sup>1</sup>, L Jonsson<sup>2</sup>, N Nordin<sup>2</sup>, C Holm&#x000e9;n<sup>2</sup>, J Askling<sup>1</sup>, J Hillert<sup>2</sup>, <underline>F Piehl</underline><sup>2</sup>, T Olsson<sup>2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Karolinska Institutet, Department of Medicine, Stockholm, Sweden, <sup>2</sup>Karolinska Institutet, Department of Clinical Neuroscience, Stockholm, Sweden</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Natalizumab (NTZ) and fingolimod (FGL) are mainly used as second line therapies for patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis and insufficient response on first line therapies. No formal randomized head-to-head studies have been conducted. In clinical practice many patients switch from NTZ to FGL due to anti-JC virus antibody positivity (JCV+).</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To compare reasons for discontinued treatment with NTZ and FGL.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> We used data from the IMSE registry, started 2006 for NTZ and 2011 for FGL as a post-marketing surveillance study using nationwide data from the Swedish MS registry. The cohort included patients initiating treatment 2011-2013: n=609 with NTZ and n=514 with FGL, of which 242 (47%) had switched from NTZ to FGL (NTZtoFGL), of them, 97% were JCV+. Reasons to discontinue therapy was analyzed with multinomial logistic regression.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The mean age was higher and the proportion of males was greater in the two FGL groups (39/39 years, 36%/34%) than in the NTZ group (36 years, 25%). Extended disability status scale (EDSS) scores at treatment start were similar in all groups, but Multiple Sclerosis Severity Score (MSSS) were higher and Symbol Digit Modalities test (SDMT) lower in NTZ patients, suggesting higher disease activity. The proportions of patients remaining on therapy at 1 year were 87%, 87% and 81% for NTZ, FGL and NTZtoFGL, respectively. The proportions of patients that discontinued therapy due to side effects were 2.4%, 7.4% and 10.7% for NTZ, FGL and NTZtoFGL, respectively, with similar results after adjustment for gender and age. The drop-out rates for lack of effect were similar between groups; 4.6%, 3.3% and 5.4% for NTZ, FGL and NTZtoFGL, respectively. However, there was a trend for more patients displaying lack of effect in both FGL groups in the last quarter of the follow-up period. In contrast, discontinuation of treatment due to lack of effect in NTZ patients occurred earlier and was mainly due to neutralizing antibodies.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The IMSE registry, with simultaneous follow-up of different drugs in the same registry platform, facilitates comparative studies and enables registration of long-term efficacy and adverse effects. The results of this study suggest that both FGL and NTZ are generally well tolerated, but that tolerability for FGL is somewhat lower than for NTZ, especially in patients switching from NTZ to FGL. We also noticed a trend for increased drop-out rates due to lack of effect in this group warranting further long-term follow-up.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section637-1352458514546077"><title>P315</title><sec id="section638-1352458514546077"><title>Clinical experience with rituximab in the treatment of refractory multiple sclerosis</title><p><underline>F Gasc&#x000f3;n</underline><sup>1</sup>, A Navarr&#x000e9;<sup>1</sup>, C Alcal&#x000e1;<sup>2</sup>, L Lacruz<sup>3</sup>, F P&#x000e9;rez-Miralles<sup>2</sup>, I Bosc&#x000e1;<sup>2</sup>, B Casanova<sup>2</sup>, F Coret<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Hospital Cl&#x000ed;nico Universitario, Unit of Neuroimmunology - Neurology Department, Valencia, Spain, <sup>2</sup>Hospital Universitari i Polit&#x000e8;cnic La Fe, MS Unit - Neurology Department, Valencia, Spain, <sup>3</sup>Hospital Francesc De Borja De Gandia, Neurology Department, Gandia, Spain</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Rituximab (RTX) is an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody approved for rheumatoid arthritis and non-Hodgkin lymphoma that lyses B-cells. Off-label RTX has been used in autoimmune neurological diseases where B lymphocytes are involved, such as neuromyelitis optica, myasthenia gravis and multiple sclerosis (MS). RTX use in MS has been reported to be safe for up to 2 years of therapy, to reduce inflammatory activity in relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) and to control progression in a subset of primary progressive MS (PPMS) patients with gadolinum enhanced lesions (GEL) in MRI.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To evaluate the efficacy and safety of compassionate use of rituximab in refractory MS patients.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> We reviewed retrospectively 33 MS patients treated with RTX. Compassionate off-label RTX was used as monotherapy in MS patients unresponsive to all other approved MS therapies and/or with contraindication to all other approved MS therapies, after signing informed consent. A first course of 1000mg of RTX (on day 1 and day 15) was administered followed by a second or third course when CD19 B-cells were greater than 2%. Clinical response (relapses and progression) and MRI activity was analyzed 6-12 months after first dose.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Thirty-three patients were treated with RTX (21 women, 63.6%); 18 SPMS (54.4%), 11 RRMS (33.3%) and 4 PPMS (12.1%).

Included studies were randomized controlled trials evaluating first-line treatments including interferon (IFN) beta-1a 30, 44, and 22 &#x000b5;g, IFN beta-1b, and glatiramer acetate, in RRMS patients. Studies were included based on a pre-specified protocol and extracted by a team of independent reviewers and information scientists. The quality of included trials was assessed according to criteria recommended by Health Technology Assessment bodies in the UK (NICE) and Germany (IQWiG). The NMA was conducted using WinBUGS (v1.4.3) with data from the placebo-controlled phase (Year 1) of the ADVANCE trial. Safety and tolerability was assessed by annualized risk of event, combining multiple trials using a weighted average of the risk in a particular time period.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> In line with ADVANCE study findings, versus placebo, the NMA showed that PEG-IFN Q2W significantly reduced annualized relapse rate (ARR; rate ratio 0.654 [95% CI: 0.484-0.897]) and 6 month-confirmed disability progression (CDP6M; hazard ratio [HR] 0.421 [95% CI: 0.236-0.711]). CDP6M was also significantly reduced for PEG-IFN Q2W versus IFN beta-1a 30 &#x000b5;g (HR 0.46 [95% CI: 0.226-0.943]), with a numerical trend favoring PEG-IFN Q2W versus other IFNs assessed for ARR, and versus all other injectables for CDP6M.

NAA/Cr ratios were higher in control group&#x02019;s white matter than patient&#x02019;s normal appearing white matter but this difference was not statistically meaningful. There was no difference in Cho/Cr ratios between two groups. In follow up period NAA/Cr and Cho/Cr ratios obtained from patients&#x02019; white matter lesions and normal appearing white matter did not change statistically.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> This study showed that in MS patients&#x02019; white matters, especially in white matter lesions, neuron viability is reduced and in patients treated with interferon beta NAA/Cr ratios remain stable. This stable levels of metabolite ratios in the patients who get interferon beta therapy can be explained by; the follow-up period in a chronic diseases like MS is short, or interferon therapy has positive effects over the course of the disease.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section647-1352458514546077"><title>P320</title><sec id="section648-1352458514546077"><title>Can fingolimod reduce the occurrence of MRI proven black hole and cerebral atrophy burden in Hispanic population with multiple sclerosis?</title><p><underline>AR Chinea</underline><sup>1</sup>, YG Hernandez<sup>1</sup>, ER Estades<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>San Juan MS Center, Caribbean Center for Clinical Research, San Juan, Puerto Rico</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Fingolimod (FG) is a sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulator that is FDA approved for the treatment of Multiple Sclerosis (MS). FG ability to reduce black hole burden and cerebral atrophy in Hispanic MS patients is currently unknown. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is the gold standard in determining inflammation and permanent axonal damage. T1 hypointensity lesions (or black holes) represent areas of axonal damage. FG treated patient had reported a decrease in T1 hypointense lesion volume in clinical trials.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To determine if FG can reduce black hole and brain atrophy burden in Hispanic population with MS.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Retrospective analysis of black hole burden was assessed by reviewing 50 patient MRI reports at baseline and 1 year post treatment with FG. MRI machines used were either 1.5 or 3.0 Tesla. Reports were submitted by board certified Neuroradiologist. Patients were instructed to go to the same MRI center for comparison with prior studies. The Hispanic patients are from a single independent specialized MS center. Another finding observed from the reports was cerebral atrophy.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> At baseline 50% of patients had black holes. At 1 year post treatment, 5 patients developed black holes and 9 patients worsened. From this data, 72% did not developed black holes. Approximately, 10% at 1 year follow up had evidence of cerebral atrophy. Only 2% of patients had developed black holes and cerebral atrophy.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> We can conclude that FG can reduce the development of black holes and brain atrophy in Hispanic population with MS. The assessment of T1 hypointensity lesion burden should become a standard outcome in future clinical trials. This study will be continued and long-term resulted will be reported.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section649-1352458514546077"><title>P321</title><sec id="section650-1352458514546077"><title>Challenges experienced by neurologists in the individualization of multiple sclerosis treatment: findings from an international study</title><p><underline>SM Hayes</underline><sup>1</sup>, S Mohammad<sup>2</sup>, P Ng<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>AXDEV Group, Brossard, QC, Canada, <sup>2</sup>Colchester University Hospital, Colchester, United Kingdom</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> The unpredictable nature of multiple sclerosis (MS) creates several challenges for healthcare providers in the optimal treatment and management of patients. With the movement towards patient-centered care, ensuring that treatment is suited to a patient&#x02019;s profile and preferences requires that providers demonstrate shared decision-making skills. An international needs assessment was conducted in 6 countries to obtain a better understanding of the knowledge, skill and confidence of providers, including nurses, neurologists, radiologists and pharmacists, involved in the treatment and management of patients with MS.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To highlight the challenges experienced specifically by neurologists in the individualization of MS treatment.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> This mixed-method International Review Board-approved study combined qualitative (semi-structured interviews) and quantitative (online surveys) data. Qualitative data were analyzed using thematic coding analysis and quantitative data were analyzed using frequencies and analyses of variance. Tamhane&#x02019;s T2 post-hoc tests were used to identify differences by country. Qualitative and quantitative findings were triangulated to strengthen the trustworthiness of the findings.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The total sample included 148 actively practicing neurologists from Germany (n=22), Spain (n=22), France (n=23), the United Kingdom (n=23), Italy (n=22) and the United States (n=36). Eighty percent of neurologists had a caseload of more than 50 MS patients/year. Issues with knowledge, skill and confidence were identified. Almost half of neurologists (45%) reported that their knowledge of new and emerging treatments for MS was unacceptable or could be improved. Two-thirds of neurologists (66%) reported that individualizing the treatment plan according to disease activity in each patient was an essential skill; of those who reported this skill as essential, 47% reported their knowledge of this skill needed improvement. The individualization of treatment based on patient goals was also a challenge reported by neurologists, with more than half (58%) reporting the need for improvement in this skill.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Given the emergence of several new MS therapies, the individualization of treatment will become increasingly important in the provision of optimal patient care. As a result, greater emphasis should be placed on the development of shared decision-making and patient- provider communication skills, at both the graduate and post-graduate levels.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section651-1352458514546077"><title>P322</title><sec id="section652-1352458514546077"><title>Fingolimod (Gilenya) confers cognitive stability in active relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis patients</title><p><underline>Y Barak</underline><sup>1,2</sup>, D Magalashvili<sup>3</sup>, T Paz<sup>3</sup>, A Achiron<sup>2,3</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Abarbanel Mental Health Center, Psychogeriatrics, Bat-Yam, Israel, <sup>2</sup>Sackler School of Medicine, Tel-Aviv, Israel, <sup>3</sup>Sheba Medical Center, Multiple Sclerosis Center, Ramat Gan, Israel</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Fingolimod (Gilenya) has shown efficacy in reducing relapses and delaying disability progression in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) RRMS patients acting as a superagonist to sphingosine-1-phosphate receptors on the surface of thymocytes and lymphocytes.

Evidence suggests positive effects of pregnancy on MS risk of relapse. For patients with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS), treatment with an appropriate drug is recommended in early disease course. For women with MS, the treatment approach may be influenced by whether they wish to have children or not.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> The aim of the Women with MS survey was to analyze MS therapy practices for women of childbearing age (15-45 years) in Switzerland, according to their wish for a child.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Online 24-question survey in German and French to assess treatment management in women with MS; neurologists from hospital and private clinics in all regions were invited. Non-parametric tests were used (5% significance level, 2-sided), with no correction for multiple testing.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The survey was completed by 56/223 invited neurologists at 48 centers treating 6034 patients with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), RRMS or primary or secondary progressive (SPMS). A total of 67.8% patients with CIS/RRMS/SPMS were female, 52.2% of childbearing age. Of these, women were classed as having no wish for children (49.9%), or a short- (&#x02264;2 years; 18.9%) or medium-term (&#x0003e;2 years; 33.9%) wish for children. Disease-modifying drug (DMD) treatment was received by fewer women with a short- (51.1%) vs medium-term (69.2%) or no (78.9%) wish for children (p&#x0003c; 0.001). Their wish for children was given as the reason for not receiving a DMD for more women in the short- (42.8%) vs medium-term (17.8%; p&#x0003c; 0.001) wish group. Among women with a short-term wish for children, 79.7% were treated with immunomodulators (interferon &#x003b2; or glatiramer acetate), 9.8% with natalizumab, 3.7% with fingolimod and 9.7% with other DMDs. Among those with no wish for children, 66.1% were treated with immunomodulators, 17.7% with natalizumab, 16.6% with fingolimod and 2.8% with other DMDs. These 2 groups (short-term/no wish) had significantly different proportions of patients in the first 3 DMD categories (p&#x02264;0.001).

After ethics committee approval and written informed consent, 74 relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) patients were included in this analysis. All patients had been treated with NTZ for at least 3 months. All patients were evaluated with the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), the MS Walking Scale 12 items (MSWS-12) and TSQM. At the time of assessment, the mean treatment duration (&#x000b1;SD) was 28,3 (&#x000b1;15,5) months.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The mean age was 40.3 (&#x000b1;10.8) years with mean disease duration of 8.1 (&#x000b1;5.8) years and mean therapy duration of 28.3 (&#x000b1;15.5) months. The annualized relapse rate in the year before the initiation of treatment with NTZ was 1.77. The mean Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) at baseline (i.e. at the start of NTZ therapy) was 3.9 (&#x000b1;1.5). Under NTZ treatment, at the time of evaluation, the relapse rate dropped to 0.25. When compared to baseline, we observed a mean EDSS improvement of 0.47 (&#x000b1;1.04) points. The mean TSQM subscores were 80.2 (&#x000b1;15.5) for efficacy, 88.3 (&#x000b1;19.9) for side effects, 69.5 (&#x000b1;18.9) for convenience and 78.2 (&#x000b1;17.8) for overall satisfaction. The mean FSS score was 4.8 (&#x000b1;1.6) and the mean MSWS-12 score was 33.2 (&#x000b1;15.4). The overall satisfaction of patients with NTZ correlated with their EDSS (r=&#x02212;0.25, p=0.03) and FSS (r=&#x02212;0.32, p=0.006) scores. The satisfaction of patients with the efficacy of NTZ correlated with EDSS (r=&#x02212;0.4, p=0.0005), FSS (r=&#x02212;0.54, p&#x0003c; 0.00001) and MSWS-12 (r=&#x02212;0.44, p=0.00009) scores. Patients who were free from measurable disease activity (i.e. no relapse, no EDSS progression, no new lesion and no active lesion on MRI) had significantly higher efficacy subscores than patients who had measurable disease activity (83.6 vs 73.9, p=0.01997).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Satisfaction was generally high in our population of NTZ-treated RRMS patients.

However, the incidence of treatment-associated progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) caused by JC virus, compromises this efficacious treatment. The administration of natalizumab every 6 weeks can maintain the same effectiveness providing a better quality of life for patients. Long-term studies are needed to fully assess the impact that extended-interval dosing (EID) might have on extending the PML risk period.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To analyze the clinical and radiological evolution of patients with relapsing remitting MS treated with natalizumab at EID of 300 mg every 6 weeks.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> A descriptive, retrospective study of data collected prospectively was performed. Patients who had received at least 13 doses of natalizumab every 4 weeks were asked to receive treatment every 6 weeks instead and they all signed consent forms. The protocol was approved by the Hospital Pharmaceutical Committee. The clinical course was analyzed by the annual relapse rate and the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS). Radiological activity was studied by measuring Gadolinium enhancing (Gd+) lesions on brain MRI performed every 6 months. Pharmaceutical costs were also analyzed.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Thirteen patients who received natalizumab every 6 weeks were included. Mean age 42&#x000b1;12 years; women 69% (9/13).

No patient treated at the 6 weeks dose range had a relapse. The mean EDSS with natalizumab every 4 weeks was 4.1 [1-6.5] and with natalizumab every 6 weeks 3.8 [0-6.5]. 46% of patients had Gd+ lesions before natalizumab treatment.

We then proceeded with records of patients who approved participation for research purposes. Next, location of 2188 patients was successfully geo-coded within Tehran metropolis by geographic information system (GIS) bureau of Iran&#x02019;s post office based on their phone number. Cluster analysis was performed using average nearest neighbor index (ANNI) and Quadrat analysis. The long-term exposure of MS patients to particulate matter (PM10), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxide (NO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and nitrogen oxides (NOx) were estimated using previously developed land use regression models.

Chi-squared test and ANOVA were used to compare demographic characteristics. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox proportional hazards regression were used to analyse time to expanded disability status scale (EDSS) 6.0, corrected for age at onset and disease duration.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Female:male ratio was 1.88 for patients born in the 1940s, 2.02 for patients born in the 1950s, 2.51 for patients born in the 1960s, and 2.85 for patients born in the 1970s (p=0.03). After correction for age at onset and sex, there were fewer patients born in the 1960s who had primary progressive MS (PPMS) (p=0.01) but there was no difference in proportion with PPMS for those born in the 1950s (p=0.22) or 1970s (p=0.25) as compared to those born in the 1940s. Proportion treated with disease-modifying therapies was 7% (1940s), 13% (1950s), 32% (1960s) and 45% (1970s). Although median time to EDSS 6.0 was shorter for patients born more recently (1940s median: 23.2 years, 1950s: 20.1y, 1960s: 18.6y, 1970s: 14.2y, p&#x0003c; 0.0001), this effect did not remain significant after correction for other variables (1950s: hazard ratio (HR) 1.17 (95% CI 0.92-1.49), p=0.20; 1960s: HR 1.40 (95% CI 0.97-2.03), p=0.08; 1970s: HR 1.46 (0.86-2.47), p=0.16).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Changes in sex ratio over time may be due to a sex-specific environmental influence on risk of MS. However, we have not found evidence that long-term prognosis has altered over the same period, suggesting that different factors may play a role in determining outcome of disease from those determining susceptibility. These findings have implications for design of clinical trials, ensuring suitable power of such trials, and directing avenues for future investigation of mechanisms underlying pathogenesis in MS.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section676-1352458514546077"><title>P334</title><sec id="section677-1352458514546077"><title>The association of multiple sclerosis prevalence and the soil heavy metal in Isfahan, Iran: one step closer to understanding etiology</title><p>M Etemadifar<sup>1</sup>, R Kiani<sup>2</sup>, B Mehrabi<sup>3</sup>, <underline>M Fereidan-Esfahani</underline><sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Isfahan University of Medical Science, Isfahan, Iran, Islamic Republic of, <sup>2</sup>Isfahan Research Commitee of Multiple Sclerosis, Isfahan, Iran, Islamic Republic of, <sup>3</sup>Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran, Iran, Islamic Republic of</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> The steep rising in the number of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients in Isfahan province, makes this province a highly interesting region for MS research.

Previous analyses have applied a critical time period hypothesis (CTPH) to estimate risk. Life Course Epidemiology offers alternative hypotheses to assess the relationship between exposure and disease, including the accumulation hypothesis (AH) and effect modification hypothesis (EMH).</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> We assessed the likelihood of these three hypotheses on MS risk, using data on early life sun exposure.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Information on early life sun exposure (0-15 years) was collected through the multi-national Environmental Risk Factor in MS Study (EnvIMS). EnvIMS is a case-control study that enrolled MS cases and population-based controls in Canada, Italy and Norway. 564 cases and 939 controls enrolled in Canada, 650 cases and 1232 controls enrolled in Italy and 911 cases and 1628 controls enrolled in Norway, are included in the analyses. We used logistic regression models to assess the likelihood of each of the three hypotheses. Likelihood ratio tests were used to compare each model to a saturated model.

While not formally tested, upon visual inspection effect sizes obtained were quite similar and had overlapping confidence intervals in all models tested. Increased risk of MS was associated with lower levels of early life sun exposure using all models tested in all three countries. In Canada, ORs ranged from 1.21 (1.07-1.37) for the AH to 1.51 (1.15-1.99) for the CTPH between ages 0 and 5 years. In Norway, ORs ranged from 1.12 (1.04-1.22) for the AH to 1.34 (1.12-1.61) for the CTPH between ages 12 and 15 years. In Italy, ORs ranged from 1.11 (1.00-1.22) for the AH and 1.26 (1.03-1.55) for the CTPH between ages 0 and 5 years.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The data suggest that the association observed between early life sun exposure and MS is consistent with each of the three hypotheses tested, implying that this association may be more complex than has been previously reported using the CTPH.

The nationwide crude prevalence on 1 January 2012 was 203/100,000. According to this study, M&#x000f8;re and Romsdal, a northwestern coastal county (approx. 260,000 population), has one of the highest prevalence rates of MS. Several previously published studies on the frequency of MS in M&#x000f8;re and Romsdal County, the first in 1952, have paved the ground for longitudinal, population-based epidemiological studies.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> The study has analyzed the time trends of incidence and prevalence in a stable population throughout a period of more than five decades.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> We applied the McAlpine criteria prior to the introduction of ancillary investigations, e.g. cerebrospinal fluid analyses (1972), evoked potentials (1975) and magnetic resonance imaging (1984), thus clinical criteria formed the basis for the diagnoses. With the implementation of refined laboratory, neurophysiologic and radiologic diagnostic tools in combination with the development of new diagnostic criteria, diagnostic accuracy and case ascertainment increased.</p><p>We have traced every patient diagnosed with MS in the county and all MS patients living in M&#x000f8;re and Romsdal on Prevalence day 1 January 2013. The primary source for MS patients was the case files at the Department of Neurology and Clinical Neurophysiology at Molde Hospital. However, we have searched all available local, regional and national sources for incident and prevalent cases. Only patients diagnosed before prevalence day are included. An experienced neurologist has examined all patients, the majority several times, during the course of illness.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The annual incidence of MS in 1935-48 was 1.7/ 100,000, increasing to 7.5/ 100,000 in 1985-89 and finally to 10.2/ 100,000 in 2000-04. The prevalence of definite/probable MS on 1 January 1961 was 24.3/100,000. By 1 January 1985, the prevalence, based on the same diagnostic criteria, increased to 75.4/100,000. On 1 January 2008, the prevalence was 246/100,000. We are currently updating the incidence until 2013 and the prevalence of MS on 1 January 2013. We present the reappraised data.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> A change in diagnostic criteria, better case ascertainment and an increasing access to disease modifying therapy and possibly a better survival are factors of importance for the incline, but changing biologic relevant risk factors during more than fifty years might also play a role.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section684-1352458514546077"><title>P338</title><sec id="section685-1352458514546077"><title>High incidence and increasing prevalence of multiple sclerosis in British Columbia, Canada: findings from over two decades (1991-2010)</title><p><underline>E Kingwell</underline><sup>1</sup>, F Zhu<sup>1</sup>, RA Marrie<sup>2</sup>, J Fisk<sup>3</sup>, C Wolfson<sup>4</sup>, S Warren<sup>5</sup>, J Profetto-McGrath<sup>5</sup>, L Svenson<sup>5</sup>, N Jette<sup>6</sup>, V Bhan<sup>3</sup>, N Yu<sup>2</sup>, L Elliot<sup>2</sup>, H Tremlett<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada, <sup>2</sup>University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB, Canada, <sup>3</sup>Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS, Canada, <sup>4</sup>McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada, <sup>5</sup>University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada, <sup>6</sup>University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> British Columbia (BC) is the most western province of Canada, with a population of approximately 4.5 million in 2010.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> We used population-based administrative health databases and a previously validated case definition to estimate the incidence and prevalence of multiple sclerosis (MS) in BC over a 15 and 20 year period respectively.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> We accessed the BC Hospital Separations, Medical Services Plan (physician visits), Vital Statistics (deaths), and Health Registration files to identify all BC residents meeting the case definition of &#x02265;3 International Classification of Disease codes for MS. Point prevalence was estimated annually on July 1, 1991-2010. Incidence and prevalence were calculated per 100,000 people using the BC mid-year population, and were age-standardized to the 2001 Canadian population. Incidence estimates were generated based on the year of the first demyelinating disease claim for 1996-2010; a previous 5 year demyelinating disease claim-free period was required. We investigated changes in incidence, prevalence and sex ratios over the observation periods using regression analyses.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> On July 1, 2010, an estimated 11,963 people with MS were living in BC, giving a standardized point prevalence of 240.7 per 100,000 persons (95% CI: 236.3-245.1). The prevalence in 1991 was 90.4 (95% CI: 87.1-93.8), and increased by approximately 5% per year on average over the 20 year observation period (p&#x0003c; 0.001). The women:men prevalence ratio increased gradually from 2.27 in 1991 to 2.72 in 2010 (p&#x0003c; 0.001) and the peak prevalence age increased from 45-49 years in 1991 to 55-59 years in 2010. From 1996 to 2010 there were 6,250 incident MS cases in BC, with an average annual age-standardized incidence rate of 9.9 (95% CI: 9.0-10.9). The annual incidence of MS remained stable over the 15 year period while the incidence sex ratio decreased somewhat over time (p=0.02), but remained above 2 for all years (averaging 2.71:1).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The incidence and prevalence of MS in British Columbia are among the highest in the world, although they are comparable to estimates from other eastern and central Canadian provinces. Neither the incidence of MS nor the incidence sex ratio showed an increase over the study period, however MS prevalence, and the prevalence sex ratio appear to have increased significantly. These findings could be explained by the observed increase in the peak prevalence age of MS, possible immigration of non-incident MS cases to BC, and the greater life expectancy of women.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section686-1352458514546077"><title>P339</title><sec id="section687-1352458514546077"><title>35 years of mortality due to multiple sclerosis in Canada, 1975-2009: no decrease in mortality rates despite shift to older age at death</title><p>S Warren<sup>1</sup>, <underline>W Janzen</underline><sup>1</sup>, K Warren<sup>1</sup>, L Svenson<sup>1</sup>, D Schopflocher<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> In the past persons with multiple sclerosis (MS) died at notably younger ages than the general population. Since the 1990s important new treatments, such as disease modifying drugs, have been introduced. Their effects might be reflected in a shift to older age at death and decreasing mortality due to MS because patients are living longer to die from other causes.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> This study&#x02019;s goal was to describe mortality due to MS in Canada from 1975 to 2009 by age and gender and to determine whether there has been a change in age at death relative to the general population.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Data on deaths due to MS, coded according to the International Classification of Diseases, and populations at risk was derived from Statistics Canada. Rates and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for the entire 35 year time span and for 5-year periods, age-standardized to the 2006 Canadian population. Trend analysis for the years 1975-2009 was performed using JoinPoint Regression. Data on deaths due to all causes in the general population was also derived from Statistics Canada.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The average annual age-standardized MS mortality rate for 1975-2009 was 1.23 (1.03-1.43). 5-year rates for 1975-79, 1980-84, 1985-89, 1990-94, 1995-99, 2000-04, 2005-09 were 1.16, 0.94, 1.01, 1.16, 1.30, 1.43, 1.33. Trend analysis showed that mortality rates over the 35 years remained essentially stable, with an average annual percent change (AAPC) of &#x0003c; 1. The average annual 1975-2009 age-standardized rates for females and males were 1.45 (1.24-1.66) and 0.99 (0.80-1.17). 5-year rates for females were always significantly higher than for males but there was no change in rate ratios over time. Rates remained essentially stable over the 35 years within both genders, AAPCs &#x0003c; 1 each. Regardless of gender, trend analysis showed a significant decrease in MS mortality rates in the 0-39 age group and significant increases in the 60-69, 70-79, and 80+ age groups (all AAPCs &#x0003c; 1), whereas there were significant decreases in all-cause mortality rates across each age group (AAPCs &#x0003c; 1). The highest MS mortality rates were consistently in the 50-59 age group for both genders from 1975 to 2009, while the highest all-cause mortality rates were in the 80+ age group.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> New treatment effects are not yet reflected in decreasing Canadian MS mortality rates. Changes in the age distribution of mortality rates indicate a shift to older age at death; however MS patients remain disadvantaged relative to the general population.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section688-1352458514546077"><title>P340</title><sec id="section689-1352458514546077"><title>Seasonal variation of relapse rate in MS is latitude-dependent</title><p><underline>T Spelman</underline><sup>1</sup>, O Gray<sup>2</sup>, M Trojano<sup>3</sup>, T Petersen<sup>4</sup>, G Izquierdo<sup>5</sup>, A Lugaresi<sup>6</sup>, R Hupperts<sup>7</sup>, R Bergamaschi<sup>8</sup>, P Duquette<sup>9</sup>, P Grammond<sup>10</sup>, G Giuliani<sup>11</sup>, C Boz<sup>12</sup>, F Verheul<sup>13</sup>, C Oreja-Guevara<sup>14</sup>, M Barnett<sup>15</sup>, F Grand&#x02019;Maison<sup>16</sup>, H Butzkueven<sup>1</sup>, on behalf of the MSBase Investigators</p><p><sup>1</sup>University of Melbourne, Melbourne Brain Centre, Parkville, Australia, <sup>2</sup>Craigavon Area Hospital, Portadown, United Kingdom, <sup>3</sup>University of Bari, Department of Basic Medical Sciences, Neuroscience and Sense Organs, Bari, Italy, <sup>4</sup>Kommunehospitalet, Arhus C, Denmark, <sup>5</sup>Hospital Universitario Virgen Macarena, Sevilla, Spain, <sup>6</sup>University &#x02018;G. d&#x02019;Annunzio&#x02019;, MS Center, Department of Neuroscience and Imaging, Chieti, Italy, <sup>7</sup>Orbis Medical Centre, Sittard-Geleen, Netherlands, <sup>8</sup>Neurological Institute IRCCS Mondino, Pavia, Italy, <sup>9</sup>H&#x000f4;pital Notre Dame, Montreal, QC, Canada, <sup>10</sup>Center de R&#x000e9;adaptation D&#x000e9;ficience Physique Chaudi&#x000e8;re-Appalache, Levis, QC, Canada, <sup>11</sup>Ospedale di Macerata, Macerata, Italy, <sup>12</sup>Karadeniz Technical University, Trabzon, Turkey, <sup>13</sup>Groene Hart Ziekenhuis, Gouda, Netherlands, <sup>14</sup>University Hospital San Carlos, Madrid, Spain, <sup>15</sup>Brain and Mind Research Institute, Sydney, Australia, <sup>16</sup>Neuro Rive-Sud, H&#x000f4;pital Charles LeMoyne, Greenfield Park, QC, Canada</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Previous studies into seasonal variation of relapses in multiple sclerosis have had conflicting results. Small relapse numbers, differing diagnostic criteria, differing relapse definitions and single region studies limit the generalizability of results. However, a large meta-analysis found that relapse onset probability varies seasonally.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> The aim of this study was to determine if there is a temporal variation in onset of relapses in both the northern and southern hemispheres and to investigate whether the lag between location-specific seasonal ultra-violet radiation (UVR) trough and subsequent relapse peak varied with latitude.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Relapses were analyzed by hemisphere and latitudinal location. All analyses were weighted for the number of patients contributed by each center. A sine regression model consisting of one sine and one cosine function, describing a single annual cycle with one peak and one trough separated by six months, was used to model relapse onset and UVR seasonality. Linear regression was used to investigate associations between latitude and lag between UVR trough and subsequent relapse peak.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> 32,762 relapses from 9811 patients in across 30 countries were analysed. Relapse onset followed an annual cyclical sinusoidal pattern with peaks in spring and troughs in autumn in both hemispheres. This seasonal variation was statistically significant, with an estimated relapse peak of the 7<sup>th</sup> March (95% CI 10<sup>th</sup> February, 28<sup>th</sup> March) in the northern hemisphere and 5<sup>th</sup> September (95% CI 10<sup>th</sup> August, 26<sup>th</sup> September) in the southern hemisphere. There was no difference in this pattern by hemisphere (p=0.254). Every 10 degrees of latitude away from the equator was associated with a mean decrease in ultra-violet radiation trough to subsequent relapse peak lag of 28.5 days (95% CI 3.29, 53.71, p=0.028), weighting for the number of patients per location and controlling for absolute UVR at each location (Figure 1). There was no difference in this association by hemisphere (p=0.811).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> In our large, multinational study of MS outcomes, we confirm prior meta-analyses showing a strongly seasonal relapse probability in the northern hemisphere, and extend this observation to the southern hemisphere. We demonstrate for the first time that there is a statistical relationship between seasonal UVR trough and relapse onset peak that is latitude-dependent, with increasing latitudes associated with shorter gaps.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section690-1352458514546077"><title>P341</title><sec id="section691-1352458514546077"><title>Risk of multiple sclerosis related to month of birth changes over time</title><p><underline>EG Celius</underline><sup>1</sup>, SH Haug<sup>2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Oslo University Hospital, Ullev&#x000e5;l, Dep. of Neurology, Oslo, Norway, <sup>2</sup>University Of Oslo, Faculty of Medicine, Oslo, Norway</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Several studies have shown an increased risk of MS in spring births in the northern hemisphere, while the risk is increased in autumn births in the southern hemisphere.

The patients and controls were subdivided in 30-year cohorts, and gender and disease course (relapsing-remitting, RRMS and primary progressive, PPMS) were analysed separately.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> An increased risk of MS for patients born in spring was only found for patients born in the period 1961-90 (p=0.00096) and only for patients with RRMS. There was no difference between females and males.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> This study confirms an increased risk of MS in patients born in spring, but shows also that this risk is restricted to patients born after 1960 and to RRMS coinciding with the period of increasing prevalence of MS. This indicates that the risk of MS may be related to a change in environmental factors occurring after 1960 and thus further studies of changes in lifestyle habits triggering MS is warranted.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section692-1352458514546077"><title>P342</title><sec id="section693-1352458514546077"><title>The changing face of MS: does ARR vary by epoch?</title><p><underline>BC Healy</underline><sup>1</sup>, T Chitnis<sup>1</sup>, F Dangond<sup>2</sup>, HL Weiner<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Brigham and Women&#x02019;s Hospital, Neurology, Partners MS Center, Brookline, MA, United States, <sup>2</sup>EMD Serono, Inc., Rockland, MA, United States</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Several recent studies have described a decreasing relapse rate over time in the placebo arms of clinical trials. One potential explanation for this observation is that the face of MS is changing due to the ability to diagnose the disease earlier and in milder forms.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> The goal of this study is to assess whether the relapse rate before and after initiation of an MS treatment is changing over time.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> We tabulated the number of relapses in the year prior to and the year after initiation of subcutaneous beta-interferon-1a (Rebif) in subjects enrolled in the CLIMB at the Partners MS Center who started treatment in three time periods (2001-2005, 2005-2009, 2009-2013). An intent-to treat principle was followed such that patients who stopped treatment before the end of the first year contributed an entire year to the analysis. The number of relapses in the year prior to treatment and the year after treatment was compared across the three time periods using a Kruskal-Wallis test. The change in pre- and post-treatment difference in ARR over the periods was assessed using a repeated measures Poisson regression model.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The mean (SD) number of relapses in the year prior to treatment initiation was 0.65 (0.75) for subjects who started treatment between 1/1/2001-1/1/2005, 0.72 (0.79) for 1/1/2005-1/1/2009, and 0.71 (0.80) for 1/1/2009-1/1/2013. No significant difference between the time intervals was observed in the patients prior to Rebif treatment (p=0.71 for three group comparison). The mean (SD) number of relapses in the year post-treatment initiation was 0.31 (0.60) for subjects who started treatment between 1/1/2001-1/1/2005, 0.34 (0.78) for 1/1/2005-1/1/2009, and 0.28 (0.56) for 1/1/2009-1/1/2013. No significant difference between the time intervals was observed (p=0.82 for three group comparison). The percent change in pre versus post-treatment ARR numerically increased over time (decrease in ARR was 52%, 53% and 61% for 1/1/2001-1/1/2005, 1/1/2005-1/1/2009, and 1/1/2009-1/1/2013, respectively, when compared to ARR prior to starting Rebif), but the change in the pre- and post-treatment difference in ARR was not statistically significant (p=0.66).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Despite some numerical changes in pre-treatment/post treatment ARR over time in subjects starting treatment with Rebif, there was no statistically significant difference between epochs.

We hypothesize that such risk estimate can help identify individuals at increased risk for MS.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> We created a weighted genetic and environmental risk score (GERS) that includes 63 genetic variants, sex, infectious mononucleosis (IM), and smoking. We tested the efficacy of GERS in the initial 1,355 subjects with at least one first-degree relative (FDR) with MS from the Genes and Environment in Multiple Sclerosis (GEMS) cohort, a prospective study that has recruited over 2,500 subjects from across the United States since 2011. Subjects with FDR and self-diagnosis of MS (6% of total) are included as embedded positive controls. Each subject submits saliva for targeted genotyping and completes a detailed web-based questionnaire that captures demographics and risk factors. MS diagnosis is confirmed by review of medical records.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> In a cross-sectional analysis of 1,265 asymptomatic and 90 MS subjects the GEMS cohort, MS subjects have a higher mean GERS than asymptomatic subjects (p=1.8e-5, after adjusting for age). In a receiver-operator curve analysis, GERS (area under the curve, AUC=0.628) performs better than the genetic risk score (GRS, AUC=0.614) or environmental risk score (sex, IM, smoking; AUC=0.565) alone in predicting MS within these FDR. Further, GRS without HLA variants (AUC=0.547) and GERS without HLA variants (AUC=0.579) are still informative of MS risk, supporting the contribution of non-HLA variants to GRS and GERS. When ranking subjects into seven quantiles based on their GERS, the proportion of MS subjects in the highest GERS quantile (13%) is significantly greater than in the lowest quantile (3%), such that an increasing GERS is associated with a greater likelihood of MS in first-degree relatives of MS patients (p-trend=8.8e-5).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our study suggests that, within MS family members, an aggregate risk estimate that includes genetic burden and environmental exposure is informative of MS risk beyond family history. Although this risk score is not yet clinically deployable, it enables the design of an adequately powered, prospective study of the higher-risk subset of MS family members to understand an individual&#x02019;s transition from health to disease.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section698-1352458514546077"><title>P345</title><sec id="section699-1352458514546077"><title>Prevalence and incidence of multiple sclerosis estimated in European Register for Multiple Sclerosis (EUReMS): study protocol of the Epi-1d study</title><p><underline>M Pugliatti</underline><sup>1</sup>, K Buckow<sup>2</sup>, D Ellenberger<sup>2</sup>, S Otero<sup>3</sup>, J Sastre-Garriga<sup>3</sup>, K-M Myhr<sup>4,5</sup>, P Flachenecker<sup>6</sup>, IR Zarbo<sup>7,8</sup>, C Marcoci<sup>7,9</sup>, G Arru<sup>7</sup>, L Rami&#x000f3;-Torrent&#x000e0;<sup>10</sup>, I Pericot<sup>11</sup>, O Carmona<sup>12</sup>, T Friede<sup>2</sup>, E Kasilingam<sup>13</sup>, T Schyns-Liharska<sup>13</sup>, C Thalheim<sup>13</sup>, for the EUReMS Consortium</p><p><sup>1</sup>University of Sassari, Sassari, Italy, <sup>2</sup>University Medical Center, Georg-August Universit&#x000e4;t, G&#x000f6;ttingen, Germany, <sup>3</sup>Multiple Sclerosis Centre of Catalonia (Cemcat), Valld&#x02019;Hebron University Hospital, Barcelona, Spain, <sup>4</sup>Norwegian Multiple Sclerosis Competence Centre, Haukeland University Hospital, Dept. of Neurology, Bergen, Norway, <sup>5</sup>KG Jebsen Centre for MS Research, University of Bergen, Dept. of Clinical Medicine, Bergen, Norway, <sup>6</sup>Neurological Rehabilitation Center Quellenhof, Bad Wildbad, Germany, <sup>7</sup>University of Sassari, Dept. of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Sassari, Italy, <sup>8</sup>University of Sassari, Dept. of Biomedical Sciences, Sassari, Italy, <sup>9</sup>State University of Medicine and Pharmacy &#x02018;Nicolae Testemitanu&#x02019;, Chisinau, Moldova, Republic of, <sup>10</sup>Hospital Universitari Josep Trueta, Neurologia, Girona, Spain, <sup>11</sup>Hospital Santa Caterina, Neurologia, Girona, Spain, <sup>12</sup>Fundaci&#x000f3; Salut Empord&#x000e0;, Neurology Dept., Figueres, Spain, <sup>13</sup>European Multiple Sclerosis Platform, EMSP, Brussels, Belgium</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> The attempt to define the burden of MS in Europe is hampered by the variability of the surveyed populations and the different ascertainment across studies.

This finding has been supported by <italic>in vitro</italic> studies, which have demonstrated anti-inflammatory effects of vitamin D. Moreover synergistic effects of vitamin D and interferon-beta (IFN-&#x003b2;) have been suggested. However, the overall evidence for a beneficial effect of vitamin D in MS is inconclusive.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To investigate how screening for vitamin D insufficiency and recommendation on vitamin D3 supplies affect 25(OH)D levels in MS patients and to examine the clinical and immunological implications of this action.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> A cohort of 210 natalizumab-treated relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) patients was enrolled in the study. In winter 2009/2010 (period 1) patients had a blood sample collected and the procedure was repeated the following winter (period 2). Patients with serum 25(OH)D &#x0003c; 50nmol/l in period 1 were recommended treatment with vitamin D3 (50 to 100&#x000b5;g per day). Information on disease duration, annualized relapse-rate (ARR) and status for neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) to IFN-&#x003b2; was obtained retrospectively from the Danish MS Treatment Register. To asses how changes in 25(OH)D affect the immune system, quantitative real-time PCR analysis of MX1, USP18, PD-1, PD-L1, IFIT1, IFIT2, IL10, IL10RA, FOXP3 and IDO1 was performed on whole blood samples from period 1 and 2 in patients with the highest change in vitamin D level between period 1 and 2, n=30.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Mean 25(OH)D increased significantly from 63 nmol/l (95% CI 58.8-67.7) to 76 nmol/l (95% CI 71.8-80.7) from period 1 to period 2 (p=5.1x10<sup>-8</sup>). At the same time mean ARR decreased from 0.61 to 0.54. We found a trend between increasing levels of 25(OH)D and decreasing ARR (p=0.07). None of the ten genes examined were associated with changes in serum 25(OH)D levels.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Recommendation of vitamin D supplies to MS patients with 25(OH)D &#x0003c; 50nmol/l resulted in a significant increase in mean 25(OH)D but was not associated with a statistically significant decrease in ARR. Whether this relates to an insufficient increase in 25(OH)D or lack of efficacy of 25(OH)D supplementation remains to be established. Changes in 25(OH)D levels did not affect gene expression of genes previously associated with either endogenous IFN-response, vitamin D or both, which underlines the complexity of vitamin D research in MS.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section702-1352458514546077"><title>P347</title><sec id="section703-1352458514546077"><title>Impact of wGRS on familial aggregation and clinical phenotypes in Italian multiple sclerosis patients</title><p><underline>F Esposito</underline><sup>1,2</sup>, C Guaschino<sup>1,2</sup>, L Ferr&#x000e8;<sup>1,2</sup>, M Sorosina<sup>2</sup>, L Moiola<sup>1</sup>, M Rodegher<sup>1</sup>, B Colombo<sup>1</sup>, V Martinelli<sup>1</sup>, G Comi<sup>1,2</sup>, F Martinelli Boneschi<sup>1,2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Scientific Institute San Raffaele, Department of Neurology, Milan, Italy, <sup>2</sup>Scientific Institute San Raffaele, Laboratory of Genetics of Neurological Complex Disorders, Milan, Italy</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a multifactorial neurologic disease characterized by modest but tractable heritability. In the last years the knowledge about the genetic variants associated with MS is improved, validating the role of 110 MS risk variants outside the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To investigate the impact of the established MS genetic risk variants on both familial aggregation and clinical phenotypes in an Italian monocentric MS cohort.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> 1476 Italian MS patients were screened for familial history of MS using a specific questionnaire administered during an outpatient visit at San Raffaele MS center. Among them, 461 sporadic probands and 93 familial probands were genotyped for 107 MS-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The weighted genetic risk score (wGRS) was calculated combining the odds ratio of 106 non-HLA variants and one SNP tagging the HLA-DRB1*1501 allele.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Familial and sporadic MS probands are indistinguishable in terms of gender, age at onset (AAO), disease course, disability and oligoclonal bands (OCB) status. In our cohort there were no statistical differences in the total wGRS score between MS cases reporting any family history of the disease and those reporting no family history, even after stratification by gender. We observed that an earlier AAO correlates with a higher wGRS score (p-value=0.03). Disease severity measured by MS severity score (MSSS), clinical course (bout onset vs progressive onset MS) and OCB status failed to show significant association with wGRS.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> This is the first Italian study aimed to evaluate the aggregation of susceptibility variants in MS patients. In our cohort, no major differences were observed between sporadic and familial MS cases in terms of wGRS, suggesting that other variants outside the known MS associated loci, probably rare variants and/or environmental factors, can explain the aggregation of the disease within families. In agreement with previous studies, we confirmed the association between a higher wGRS and a lower AAO. We speculate that the accumulation of known genetic risk factors may reduce the threshold for the clinical manifestation of the disease, without influencing the disease severity. We also observed a lack of association between wGRS and disability nor clinical course.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section704-1352458514546077"><title>P348</title><sec id="section705-1352458514546077"><title>A prospective case-control study of dietary salt intake and risk of pediatric MS</title><p><underline>J McDonald</underline><sup>1</sup>, J Graves<sup>1</sup>, S Lulu<sup>1</sup>, A Waldman<sup>2</sup>, A Belman<sup>3</sup>, B Greenberg<sup>4</sup>, B Weinstock-Guttman<sup>5</sup>, G Aaen<sup>6</sup>, J Mendelt-Tillema<sup>7</sup>, J Hart<sup>1</sup>, J Ness<sup>8</sup>, J Rubin<sup>9</sup>, L Krupp<sup>3</sup>, M Gorman<sup>10</sup>, L Benson<sup>10</sup>, M Rodriguez<sup>7</sup>, T Chitnis<sup>10</sup>, T Simmons<sup>11</sup>, TC Casper<sup>11</sup>, J Rose<sup>12</sup>, E Waubant<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>UCSF Regional Pediatric MS Center, San Francisco, CA, United States, <sup>2</sup>University of Pennsylvania, Department of Neurology, Philadelphia, PA, United States, <sup>3</sup>SUNY Stony Brook, Department of Neurology, Stony Brook, NY, United States, <sup>4</sup>UT Southwestern, Department of Neurology, Dallas, TX, United States, <sup>5</sup>SUNY Buffalo, The Pediatric MS Center at the Jacobs Neurological Institute, Buffalo, NY, United States, <sup>6</sup>Loma Linda University, Department of Child Neurology, Loma Linda, CA, United States, <sup>7</sup>Mayo Clinic, Department of Neurology, Rochester, MN, United States, <sup>8</sup>Alabama Pediatric MS Center, Birmingham, AL, United States, <sup>9</sup>Northwestern Feinberg School of Medicine, Department of Neurology, Chicago, IL, United States, <sup>10</sup>Massachusetts General Hospital, Partners Pediatric MS Center, Boston, MA, United States, <sup>11</sup>University of Utah, Department of Pediatrics, Salt Lake City, UT, United States, <sup>12</sup>University of Utah, Department of Neurology, Salt Lake City, UT, United States</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Environmental and dietary factors have become increasingly recognized in the past decades as potential risk factors for developing multiple sclerosis (MS). Pediatric MS offers a unique opportunity to study such factors, due to temporal proximity at the time of diagnosis to the exposure, thereby minimizing recall bias. High salt intake has been shown to increase disease onset and progression in recent animal studies. Whether these results are applicable to human disease is currently unknown.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To determine if dietary salt intake is a risk factor for pediatric MS in a multi-center cohort of pediatric cases and controls.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> A prospective case-control study was performed with pediatric-onset MS patients (first clinical attack before 18 years) with disease onset less than 2 years duration who were seen at one of 13 pediatric MS centers. Controls, less than 20 years old, were recruited at the same centers.</p><p>Dietary sodium intake was assessed using the Block Kids Food Screener (NutritionQuest), a validated, self-report questionnaire that evaluates the frequency and portion of beverages/foods consumed. Sodium intake was compared between cases and controls and adjusted for age, gender, race and ethnicity in logistic regression models.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Among 138 cases (mean age =15 years) and 285 controls (mean age = 14 years), baseline characteristics were similar for mean energy intake (kcal/d), total fat (g/d) and race. There were significantly more females (60.14 vs. 48.07%) and Hispanic/Latino (31.88% vs. 17.89%) cases compared to controls.</p><p>There was no significant difference in unadjusted mean sodium intake between cases (1965 mg/d) and controls (2072 mg/d) and the proportion of subjects exceeding the adequate intake was similar between cases and controls (62% vs. 68%). Among male subjects, both cases (2349 mg/d) and controls (2435 mg/d) exceeded the Tolerable Upper Limit (2300 mg/d) for sodium intake.</p><p>A non-significant trend towards increased odds of MS (1.015) for each 100 mg increase in sodium (95% CI 0.992, 1.038; p=0.19) was observed in the analyses adjusted for age, gender, race and ethnicity. Adjusted analyses including socioeconomic status and body mass index are pending.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> No difference in dietary salt intake was found between cases and controls in the preliminary analyses. Further analyses that include variables associated with MS risk are needed to explore whether increased salt contributes to the development of pediatric MS.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section706-1352458514546077"><title>P349</title><sec id="section707-1352458514546077"><title>Increasing prevalence and stable incidence of multiple sclerosis in Western Norway, 1953-2013</title><p><underline>N Grytten</underline><sup>1</sup>, JH Aarseth<sup>2</sup>, HMB Lunde<sup>1</sup>, K-M Myhr<sup>2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>National Multiple Sclerosis Competence Centre, Department of Neurology, Bergen, Norway, <sup>2</sup>Norwegian MS Registry &#x00026; Biobank, Department of Neurology, Bergen, Norway</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Hordaland County, Western Norway is a high risk area for multiple sclerosis (MS). Follow-up studies have suggested a rising prevalence although a stable incidence since the 1980&#x02019;ies. Increase in prevalence followed by a change in age distribution in MS has been reported elsewhere. The rising prevalence may be attributed to longer disease duration due to earlier age at symptom onset and diagnosis and/or later age at death. We performed a 60 years follow up of incidence and prevalence of MS to describe the occurrence of MS in Western Norway.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To compare the prevalence of MS in 2003 and 2013, and to explore the long-term incidence and age distribution of MS in Hordaland County, Western Norway.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> All patients in Hordaland County diagnosed with MS at the Department of Neurology, Haukeland University Hospital, Bergen, Norway, were identified. The patients were diagnosed with MS according to Poser criteria (definite and probable MS) and McDonald&#x02019;s criteria (during 2003-2012). The study comprised 1558 MS; of whom 897 living in Hordaland County per January 1<sup>st</sup> 2003, and 1035 per January 1<sup>st</sup> 2013.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The prevalence increased 10- fold from 20 per 100,000 in 1963, to 203 per 100,000 (95% CI: 190.1-216.8) in 2003 and 211.0 (95% CI: 198.3-224.2) per 100,000 in 2013. Prevalence in 2003 increased from 150 at follow-up 1.1.2003, to 203 per 100,000 at follow-up 1.1.2013 with the inclusion of additional 220 patients with onset prior to 2003. The annual mean incidence rate of MS was stable at 8-9 per 100,000 since 1982. The peak age specific prevalence shifted from 45-59 years in 2003 to 65-69 years in 2013 and there was also a trend towards increased age specific prevalence rates in younger age groups. The sex ratio was stable at 1.8:1 during the whole period. Time delay from symptom onset to diagnosis declined from a mean of 10 years since 1958 to 0.7 in 2008-2012.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> We detected a rising prevalence throughout the study period, but a stable incidence since 1982 indicating possible longer disease duration due to earlier diagnosis and improved survival.

The frequencies of the six main categories of IIDD were: MS (75%), NMO (12%), NMOSD (6%), CIS (3%), ADEM (1%) and rare forms (0.3%). In all categories, females predominated (61 to 83%), with a mean age corresponding to the third and fourth decades of life . White ethnicity also predominated, except for NMO, for which 51% of the affected individuals were non-white. Four cases in Asians and no cases in Indians. The relative frequency of NMO varied from 43% in Venezuela, 14% in Brazil, 8% in Paraguay and 2% in Argentina and the frequency of NonWhites in NMO was respectively 82%, 50%, 33% and 0% in Argentina. Anti-AQP4 antibodies were measured in 261 cases, with positive results in 56% of patients with NMO and in 28% of the patients with NMOSD and negative results in the remainder of the investigated IIDD categories.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Despite the lower prevalence of MS in South America, the disease follow the same clinical pattern of high prevalence areas. The MS frequency increase in a north south gradient differing from NMO, suggesting an genetic influence.

Here, we investigated the relationship between salt consumption and MS disease clinical and radiological activity.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To asses the reliability of sodium intake measurement using spot urine and to investigate the relationship between salt consumption and clinical and radiological disease activity in MS.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Sodium intake was calculated in spot urine samples from a cohort of 70 relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis patients using Tanaka&#x02019;s equation. The effect of sodium intake in MS disease activity was estimated by regression analysis. Because large fluctuations on sodium intake could have an impact on our study results, we retested all 70 patients for sodium intake every 3 months during a year and repeated the analyses. Finally, we then replicated our findings in a separate group of 52 MS patients.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> There were no significant changes in sodium intake across all measurements (P=0.2), suggesting that sodium intake remained relatively stable. We found an exacerbation rate that was 2.75- (95% CI 1.3-5.8) or 3.95-fold (95% CI 1.4-11.2) higher in patients with medium or high sodium intakes compared with the low-intake group. Additionally, individuals with high sodium intake had a 3.4-fold greater chance of developing a new lesion on the MRI. To evaluate the possible impact of sodium intake fluctuations in our findings we repeated the analyses using the other 3 timepoints. As with our main analysis, we found a positive correlation between exacerbation rate and sodium intake at months 3, 6 and 9 in a multivariate model. We then tested the robustness of our results by repeating the main analyses with a different equation to estimate sodium intake with spot urine: compared with the baseline group, the average and above average intake groups presented an exacerbation rate of 2.75 (95% CI 0.6-12.6) and 3.54-fold higher (95% CI 1.13-11.3) than the baseline group. Finally, a similar relationship was found in the independent replication group of 52 MS patients.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our results suggest that sodium intake estimation using spot urine is a stable and valid test and that a higher sodium intake is associated with increased clinical and radiological disease activity in MS patients.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section712-1352458514546077"><title>P352</title><sec id="section713-1352458514546077"><title>Body mass index and baseline vitamin D status modify the response to vitamin D supplementation in multiple sclerosis patients and healthy controls</title><p><underline>P Bhargava</underline><sup>1</sup>, SU Steele<sup>1</sup>, JF Marcus<sup>2</sup>, NR Revirajan<sup>2</sup>, E Waubant<sup>3</sup>, EM Mowry<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Neurology, Baltimore, MD, United States, <sup>2</sup>University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, United States, <sup>3</sup>University of California San Francisco, Neurology, San Francisco, CA, United States</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> While vitamin D insufficiency is a risk factor for multiple sclerosis (MS), it is common in the general population.

In multivariate models accounting for age, BMI, medication adherence, and baseline vitamin D and albumin levels, there was still some evidence that MS patients may have a reduced response to vitamin D supplementation, although the 95% confidence intervals included zero. Higher BMI (p=0.006), worse medication adherence (p=0.002), lower baseline vitamin D levels (p=0.003), and higher baseline serum albumin levels (p=0.003) were independently associated with a less robust change in serum vitamin D levels.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> While subjects with MS appear to have a lower rise in vitamin D levels with supplementation, this may be explained in part by BMI and baseline vitamin D levels. Modification of vitamin D dosing may be required based on these variables.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section714-1352458514546077"><title>P353</title><sec id="section715-1352458514546077"><title>Epidemiology of multiple sclerosis in the Republic of Moldova: an incidence and prevalence study in the northern and central regions</title><p><underline>C Marcoci</underline><sup>1,2,3</sup>, V Lisnic<sup>1,2</sup>, M Sangheli<sup>1,2</sup>, A Belenciuc<sup>1,2</sup>, G Rosu<sup>4</sup>, M Leone<sup>5</sup>, M Pugliatti<sup>6</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>State University of Medicine and Pharmacy &#x02018;N.Testemi&#x00163;anu&#x02019;, Chisinau, Moldova, Republic of, <sup>2</sup>Institute of Neurology and Neurosurgery, Dept. of Neurology, Chisinau, Moldova, Republic of, <sup>3</sup>Dept. of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Sassari, Sassari, Italy, <sup>4</sup>District Hospital of Riscani, Riscani, Moldova, Republic of, <sup>5</sup>Ospedale Maggiore della Carit&#x000e0;, Novara, Italy, <sup>6</sup>University of Sassari, Dept. of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Sassari, Italy</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> In Europe the total prevalence of MS is about 83 per 100,000 and the estimated mean annual incidence rate is about 4 per 100,000. The literature on MS epidemiology in Eastern Europe is scarce and out of date. Data from Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Russia, Russia, Slovakia, and Ukraine show a prevalence of 21 to 83, and an annual incidence of 0.7 to 6.0 per 100,000 pop. No studies are reported for Moldovans, an ethnicity sharing features with Romanians, Russians and Ukrainians.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> This study aims to estimate age and sex-specific incidence and prevalence of MS in Moldovans.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> The study area is represented by the Municipality of Chisinau (800,601 pop. on 2013 National Statistics), and by the Regions of Central and Northern Moldova (348,649 and 379,592 pop., respectively). Patients with MS with 2010 McDonald Criteria were included, and the following epidemiological sources sought: records from Chisinau Hospitals, District Hospitals of Ungheni, Nisporeni, Criuleni, Straseni, Riscani, Briceni, Edinet, Glodeni, and Singerei, and the Moldovan MS Association. The mean crude annual incidence for the period 2006-12, the crude prevalence for December 31<sup>st</sup> 2012, and the distribution of relapsing remitting (RR), or progressive initial course were computed.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Between 2006 and 2012, 112 patients (43 men, 69 women) had MS onset in the study area, yielding a crude mean annual incidence rate of 1.0 (95% confidence intervals, CIs, -1.7, 3.8), with a woman:man (W:M) ratio of 1.5. Mean (SD) age at onset was 31.8 (10.8) years, 28.7 (9.8) in men and 33.8 (11.0) in women (p=0.014); 106 (94.6%) had a RR course at onset, and 6 (5.4%) a progressive course. On prevalence day, 244 individuals (84 men, 160 women) with MS were living in the study area, for a crude onset-adjusted prevalence of 16.0 per 100,000 (95%CIs: 12.2, 19.8) and a W:M ratio of 1.7.

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have uncovered &#x0003e;100 genetic variants associated with MS susceptibility. Although their molecular functions remain to be fully characterized, many of these variants modulate gene expression levels as expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), and we recently showed that MS-associated eQTLs tend to be T-cell specific (Raj et al. 2014, <italic>Science</italic>).</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> Here we perform an eQTL analysis in peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from MS patients in order to: (i) functionally characterize variants previously associated with MS and (ii) describe drug-specific eQTLs.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> We isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 206 patients with relapsing remitting MS and 26 patients with clinically isolated syndrome and measured mRNA expression using the Affymetrix GeneChip Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array. Of the patients, 79 were untreated, 90 were treated with interferon beta, and 63 were treated with glatiramer acetate at the time of sampling. For our <italic>cis</italic>-eQTL analysis, we computed the correlation between gene expression and genotypes within 1 Mb of the gene transcription start site in the entire cohort and in the cohort stratified by treatment. Using these <italic>cis</italic>-eQTLs, we examined the overlap of regulatory SNPs with MS-associated SNPs using Relative Trait Concordance. Finally, we used a robust statistical method (&#x003c0;<sub>1</sub>) to quantify the proportion of sharing between treatments as estimated from the enrichment of low p-values.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> We show that 52 MS susceptibility variants are <italic>cis</italic>-eQTLs at <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 10<sup>-5</sup>. For the majority of these loci, the MS and <italic>cis</italic>-eQTL effects are likely driven by the same marker variant suggesting that this colocalization is not coincidental. Next, we demonstrate the utility of <italic>cis</italic>-eQTL data in fine-mapping the <italic>SLC15A2</italic> locus. Finally, we illustrate that a significant proportion of regulatory effects are treatment specific and that interferon beta has a stronger effect on the PBMC regulatory landscape than glatiramer acetate.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our systematic analyses provide evidence for a primary role of MS susceptibility alleles in altering mRNA expression. We highlight the power of intermediate traits in fine-mapping and the importance of context-specific eQTL analyses in the functional characterization of MS-associated variants.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section720-1352458514546077"><title>P356</title><sec id="section721-1352458514546077"><title>The use of valproic acid and multiple sclerosis</title><p><underline>NM Nielsen</underline><sup>1</sup>, H Svanstr&#x000f6;m<sup>1</sup>, E Stenager<sup>2,3,4</sup>, M Magyari<sup>5</sup>, N Koch-Henriksen<sup>6,7</sup>, B Pasternak<sup>1</sup>, A Hviid<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Statens Serum Institut, Department of Epidemiology Research, Copenhagen, Denmark, <sup>2</sup>University of Southern Denmark, Institut of Regional Health Research, Odense, Denmark, <sup>3</sup>Rigshospitalet, Danish Multiple Sclerosis Registry, Copenhagen, Denmark, <sup>4</sup>Multiple Sclerosis Clinic of Southern Jutland, Department of Neurology, S&#x000f8;nderborg, Denmark, <sup>5</sup>Danish Multiple Sclerosis Research Centre, Department of Neurology, Neuroscience Center, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark, <sup>6</sup>University of Aarhus, Department of Clinical Epidemiology, Clinical Institute, Aarhus, Denmark, <sup>7</sup>Rigshospitalet, The Danish Multiple Sclerosis Registry, Copenhagen, Denmark</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Animal studies have suggested that drugs that inhibit the enzyme histone deacetylase (HDAC) might have a beneficial effect on experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (a murine model of multiple sclerosis). Valproic acid (VPA), an anti-epileptic drug, is the only widely used human drug with a HDAC inhibitory effect. No one has examined, however, whether use of VPA among humans reduces the risk of Multiple Sclerosis (MS).</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To examine if VPA use is associated with a reduced risk of MS.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Using information on filled VPA prescriptions from the nation-wide Danish Prescription Drug Registry established in 1996, we identified a cohort of all new users of VPA and a cohort of non-users of VPA in the period 1997-2011. Incident MS cases were identified in the Danish Multiple Sclerosis Registry. To adjust for baseline differences in the probability of receiving anti-epileptic treatment, we estimated propensity scores as the probability of VPA use among the cohort of VPA users and among the cohort of non-users of VPA given variables potentially associated with use of VPA such as age, sex, place of birth, region of residence, calendar year, migraine, epilepsy, depression and other psychiatric affective disorders. Information on these covariates was obtained from the Danish Civil Registration System or the Danish National Patient Registry. VPA users were subsequently matched on propensity scores with non-users of VPA in a 1:4 ratio and incidence rates of MS were compared among VPA users and non-users of VPA using Cox regression to estimate hazard ratios (HRs).</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Among 16,028 ever-users of VPA and 54,172 non-users we identified 19 and 31 cases of MS, respectively. Compared to non-users of VPA, current-users of VPA were not at a reduced risk of MS (HR=1.09 (95% confidence interval; 0.38-3.16), n=4) neither were recent-users of VPA who had ceased VPA treatment within the last year (HR=1.11 (0.26-4.81), n=2), respectively. Similarly in an intention-to-treat analysis ever-users of VPA were not at reduced risk of MS (HR=2.15 (1.20-3.81), n=19).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> : In the first human study addressing a possible beneficial effect of VPA use on the risk of MS we found no support for a protective effect. However, the few numbers of MS in the present study does limit the conclusion that can be drawn. Future studies have to be carried out to support or decline a possible therapeutic role of VPA in MS.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section722-1352458514546077"><title>P357</title><sec id="section723-1352458514546077"><title>Vitamin D levels and antibody titers against Epstein-Barr virus and human herpesvirus 6 in multiple sclerosis patients: a one-year follow-up study</title><p>I Ortega-Madue&#x000f1;o<sup>1</sup>, L Lopez-Lozano<sup>1</sup>, M Garcia-Montojo<sup>1</sup>, MI Dominguez-Mozo<sup>1</sup>, AM Arias-Leal<sup>1</sup>, MA Garcia-Martinez<sup>1</sup>, I Casanova<sup>1</sup>, MJ Torrejon<sup>1</sup>, R Arroyo<sup>1</sup>, <underline>R Alvarez-Lafuente</underline><sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Hospital Clinico San Carlos, Madrid, Spain</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Systemic or locally produced 1,25(OH)(2) Vitamin D3 exerts its effects on several immune-cell types, including macrophages, dendritic cells, T and B cells; it has been described that 1,25(OH)2VD3 is able to block B-cell proliferation, plasma-cell differentiation and immunoglobulin production. In recent years, altered levels of vitamin D have been associated with multiple sclerosis (MS).</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To evaluate the possible association between the levels of 25-OH Vitamin D with the levels of IgG and IgM antibodies against Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) and human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) in MS patients in a one-year follow-up study.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Serum samples from 304 MS patients were analyzed in a prospective study of one-year of duration. Two serum samples were collected for each one of the MS patients: at the recruitment and 12 months later (mean 11.8 &#x000b1;1.2 months). For each one of the samples we analyzed: the levels of 25-OH Vitamin D (Abbott), IgG antibodies against Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen (EBNA) (Trinity), IgG antibodies against EBV viral capsid antigen (VCA) (Trinity), and IgG and IgM anti-HHV-6 (Panbio). Samples were analyzed in duplicate for each test.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> For the 50.5% of MS patients the levels of 25-OH Vitamin D were &#x0003e;20 ng/ml; only for the 13.2% of MS patients the levels of 25-OH Vitamin D were &#x0003e;30 ng/ml. When we analyzed the correlation of the variation of 25-OH Vitamin D levels between the basal visit and the 12 month visit with the variation in the anti-EBNA IgG levels, anti-VCA IgG levels, anti-HHV-6 IgG and IgM levels after one-year of follow-up, we did not find any statistical significant difference. However, when we only considered those MS patients with basal levels of 25-OH Vitamin D &#x0003e;20 ng/ml, we found that the 80% and the 75% of MS patients with a decrease in the levels of the 25-OH Vitamin D&#x0003e;25% between the basal visit and the 12 month visit experienced an increase of the anti-EBNA IgG levels (p=0.037) and the anti-HHV-6 IgG levels (p=0.044), respectively.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Variations of the 25-OH Vitamin D levels in MS patients with low 25-OH Vitamin D levels did not correlate with possible variations in the antibody titers against EBV and HHV-6. However, significant decreases in the 25-OH Vitamin D levels in MS patients with higher levels of 25-OH Vitamin D could be correlated with significant increases of the anti-EBNA IgG and the anti-HHV-6 IgG levels, two of the main candidates associated with MS etiology. Further studies will be needed to confirm these results.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section724-1352458514546077"><title>P358</title><sec id="section725-1352458514546077"><title>Early-onset multiple sclerosis in Isfahan, Iran: a report of the demographic and clinical features of 221 patients</title><p><underline>M Fereidan-Esfahani</underline><sup>1</sup>, M Etemadifar<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Isfahan University of Medical Science, Isfahan, Iran, Islamic Republic of</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> It is estimated that early onset MS (EOMS) approximately incorporates 3-5% of the MS population.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> There has been about 4-fold increase in MS population in Isfahan to date; hence, we aim to give an update and compare the demographic features, clinical and imaging findings at onset of EOMS in true childhood MS versus juvenile MS, and to discuss them in the light of earlier studies on pediatric MS.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> This prospective study concerned MS patients in whom the disease started before the age of 16 years and who were referred to Isfahan MS Society from October 1997 to February 2014.

Linear regression analysis of P-MSSS by race and gender adjusted for age was carried out.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> 465 MS outpatients completed PDDS (completion rate &#x0003e;90%). 257 (55%) were Caucasian, 96 (21%) African-American (AA), 85 (18%) Hispanic and 6% &#x02018;other&#x02019;. AA were similar in age to Caucasians, 46.2 (12.0) vs. 45.5 (11.7) (p=0.599), and disease duration, 12.6 (8.3) vs. 13.6 (10.4) years (p=0.45). Hispanics were younger than Caucasians, 41.1 (10.7) years (p&#x0003c; 0.0002) and had shorter disease duration, 11.0 (7.3) years (p= 0.036). There were more women among AA (80.2%) and Hispanics (79.9%) than among Caucasians (67.7%), (p&#x0003c; 0.0001 for both). Disease-modifying therapy use was similarly high across all groups: 83.3% Caucasians, 80.2% AA and 84.7% Hispanics. Mean P-MSSS differed significantly (p&#x0003c; 0.001) among the three races: they were the highest in AA (4.48 +/- 3.02), intermediate in Hispanics (4.14 +/- 2.81) and lowest in Caucasians (3.42 +/- 2.5). Linear regression analysis of P-MSSS by race and gender after adjustment for age revealed that, compared to reference Caucasian women group, AA men had the highest increase in disease severity (P-MSSS increase of +2.20, p=0.002), followed by Hispanic women (+1.10, p=0.004) and AA women (+1.01, p=0.005).

Our P-MSSS-based analysis confirms earlier reports of the more rapid disease course in AA as compared to Caucasians and suggests that in Hispanics disease course may also be more rapid than in Caucasians. Gender was an effect modifier of the relation between disease severity and race; the most severe disease course was observed in AA men.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section728-1352458514546077"><title>P360</title><sec id="section729-1352458514546077"><title>Disease progression in multiple sclerosis after age 65</title><p><underline>E Leray</underline><sup>1,2</sup>, M Genevray<sup>3</sup>, S Mrejen<sup>4</sup>, C Papeix<sup>4</sup>, C Lubetzki<sup>4</sup>, G Edan<sup>2,3</sup>, M Rosenheim<sup>5</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>EHESP School of Public Health, Epidemiology, Rennes, France, <sup>2</sup>INSERM CIC-P 1414, Rennes, France, <sup>3</sup>Pontchaillou Hospital, Neurology Department, Rennes, France, <sup>4</sup>AP-HP - Salpetriere Hospital, Neurology Department, Paris, France, <sup>5</sup>AP-HP - Salpetriere Hospital, Infectious Diseases Department, Paris, France</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Age at onset of multiple sclerosis (MS) is known to be associated with both disease phenotype and later disability progression. But little is known about disease progression after age 60-65, as only small numbers of old patients have been included in natural history studies. Neuropathology studies (Frischer, 2009) reported that in older patients with long-term disease duration, inflammatory infiltrates decline to levels similar to those found in age-matched controls and the extent of axonal injury is not different from that in age-matched controls. This suggests that disease activity and progression may die out in aged patients with long MS duration.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To compare MS disability progression before and after age 65.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Data from the Rennes and Paris-Salp&#x000ea;tri&#x000e8;re MS databases were used. Inclusion criteria were: definite diagnosis of MS, disease duration of more than 5 years, and at least two EDSS measurements (1-year interval). In a first analysis, two EDSS scores were randomly selected among MS patients after age 65. For each case older than 65, we selected 4 less than 60-year-old MS patients matched for the first EDSS score and the follow-up period between the two EDSS measurements. Percentages of patients with increased EDSS score (1 point if initial EDSS score was &#x0003c; 5, and 0.5 point if &#x02265;5.5) were compared between the two groups. In a second analysis, times remaining at each EDSS step before reaching the next EDSS scores (sustained only) will be compared between the two groups.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> In the first analysis, 48 patients aged more than 65 were matched to 142 patients less than 60. Age at MS onset was significantly higher (40 years (y) vs 26 y, p&#x0003c; .0001) and total follow-up duration was longer (31 y vs 21 y, p&#x0003c; .0001) in old patients compared to patients below 60 years. The median first randomly selected score was 6 (range: 0-9) in both groups.

Scotland, sitting at a relatively high latitude, has a high prevalence of MS (188/100,000) (MS Atlas, 2013), and Orkney, at an even higher latitude (59&#x000b0;N), has the highest prevalence in the world (402/100,000) (Visser et al., 2012). Vitamin D deficiency has been hypothesised as a possible environmental risk factor for MS.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> We aimed to better understand plasma vitamin D levels in mainland Scotland and Orkney, by both latitude (Orkney vs. mainland Scotland) and climate (sunny vs. cloudy halves of the country).</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> We obtained plasma vitamin D measurements for 4155 residents of Orkney and mainland Scotland, and adjusted them to the month of May to remove the seasonal effect. We further categorised May-adjusted vitamin D into good (&#x0003e;50 nmol/L), low risk (40-50 nmol/L), high risk (25-40 nmol/L), deficient (12.5-25 nmol/L) and severely deficient (&#x0003c; 12.5 nmol/L).</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> In an age- and sex-adjusted linear model, seasonally-adjusted vitamin D concentration was significantly higher in Orkney compared to mainland Scotland (p &#x0003c; 0.001). Severe deficiency was significantly higher in mainland Scotland (p &#x0003c; 0.001). In an age- and sex-adjusted linear model seasonally-adjusted vitamin D concentration was also associated with climate; vitamin D concentration was significantly higher in the sunnier half of the country (p=0.04).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The higher prevalence of severely deficient individuals in mainland Scotland compared to Orkney may be due to the &#x0201c;outdoors lifestyle&#x0201d; in Orkney compared to mainland Scotland. Furthermore, the significantly higher vitamin D associated with greater sunshine hours suggests that longitude is more important than latitude, reflecting the different climates in the east and west of Scotland. Future work will investigate how occupation and time spent outdoors are associated with vitamin D in Scotland.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section734-1352458514546077"><title>P363</title><sec id="section735-1352458514546077"><title>Prevalence, demographics and clinical characteristics of multiple sclerosis in the city of Tlemcen, Algeria</title><p><underline>Z Barka Bedrane</underline><sup>1</sup>, L Henaoui<sup>2</sup>, M Senoussaoui<sup>2</sup>, D Regagaba<sup>2</sup>, R Manaa<sup>2</sup>, S Benabadji<sup>1</sup>, D Bouchenak Khelladi<sup>1</sup>, M Arezki<sup>3</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>CHU Dr T.

Kumar et al. reported that MS in Japan was associated with less disability than UK based on a limited sample size (ECTRIMS 2013, P764).</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> This survey was undertaken to evaluate the status and progression of disability and to assess the degree of severity based on Patient Determined Disease Step (PDDS) scale.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> This survey was conducted by collecting questionnaire forms from patients via postal mail. The questionnaire including demographic/clinical information was sent to the patients through three Japanese MS patients&#x02019; associations. The patients were asked to evaluate their own disability using two standards &#x02013; PDDS and the SF-8 Quality of Life (QoL).</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> MS patients (n=2,823) were asked to complete the questionnaires and 1,089(38.6%) responses were received, of which 74% were MS patients and 24% were Neuromyelitis Optica (NMO) patients. Age range was very similar to that of the recipients of Certificates of Specified Disease Treatment in Japan. According to the PDDS result of the patients, about 45 % of patients have gait disability (PDDS=3) or higher. It is demonstrated that the older at onset of MS, the shorter the duration from &#x0201c;mild/moderate disability&#x0201d; to &#x0201c;bilateral support/wheelchair/bedridden&#x0201d;. The mean duration from first symptom to initiation of treatment was 4.5 years. The duration was longer (7.8 years) for young onset group (less than 29 years of age) than that (2.2 years) of the old onset group (more than 40). The patients whose current disabilities were reported as &#x0201c;early or late cane/bilateral support/wheelchair/bedridden&#x0201d; tended to start treatment after gait disability. Regarding QoL, the PDDS scores correlated with the physical component (PCS) but not with the mental component (MCS), although the MCS tends to be lower than that of the Japanese healthy population.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> This survey revealed that the prevalence of Japanese MS patients with gait disability (PDDS=3 or more) was 45%. In addition, the duration from first symptom to the initiation of treatment in MS patients with severe impairment tends to be longer than that of patients with mild impairment, which suggests that earlier treatment may slow the progression of MS.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section738-1352458514546077"><title>P365</title><sec id="section739-1352458514546077"><title>Highly active multiple sclerosis and Epstein-Barr virus reactivation</title><p><underline>MM Paz Soldan</underline><sup>1</sup>, EP Flanagan<sup>1</sup>, OH Kantarci<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Mayo Clinic, Neurology, Rochester, MN, United States</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Risk of developing multiple sclerosis (MS) has been associated with an expanding number of factors, including infections. Of all infectious agents studied, Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) has shown the strongest association with MS. EBV has also been suspected to influence disease activity, but studies have been contradictory. Investigations of EBV reactivation in highly active MS have not been reported.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To report patients with EBV reactivation coincident with highly active MS.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Patients were identified from our clinical practice. MS disease activity was assessed by neurologic evaluation and MRI. Serologic testing for EBV nuclear antigen (EBNA)-1 IgG, viral capsid antigen (VCA) IgG, and VCA IgM was performed by multiplex fluoromagnetic bead assay.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold></p><p><italic>Patient 1</italic> - A 29-year-old man was admitted to hospital for subacutely worsening gait ataxia, blurred vision and headache.

Evaluation was consistent with MS, he improved following IV methylprednisolone, and interferon beta-1a was initiated. He remained without clinical relapse at follow up the next year and VCA IgM had become negative. MRI showed a few enhancing lesions and he transitioned to fingolimod. A few months later he returned with multifocal neurologic symptoms and examination findings. MRI showed extensive MS activity and VCA IgM was again positive.

Longer follow up for patient-1 also established a concurrent relapsing pattern. The temporal association with fingolimod, which is known to increase risk for herpes virus reactivation, may be informative. We propose that, in some patients, highly active MS may be precipitated by EBV reactivation.

Residential proximity from main roads measured in meters (m) and by ArcGIS software was used as a surrogate for exposure to traffic-related air pollution.

With improved knowledge about vitamin D&#x02019;s immune modulating effects has the hypothesis of vitamin D as a protective environmental factor in MS emerged.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> The study is retrospective with the objective to determine serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-(OH)D) status of MS patients from a geographically well defined area and investigate correlations to demographic and paraclinical findings.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Data used is from the Main Sclerosis Database at Glostrup Hospital, including 554 consecutive patients from the uptake area with a registered serum 25-(OH)D level. Serum 25-(OH)D was compared to demographic findings and paraclinical outcomes, sample groups ranged between 28-554 patients. Analyses where additionally performed on date-adjusted paraclincal data (+/- 30 days) to the date of serum 25-(OH)D measure, sample groups ranged between 9-50 patients. Categorical data was analyzed using Qui-square test and quantitative data was analyzed using Spearman&#x02019;s correlation. Significance was defined as a p-value &#x0003c; 0.05.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Our study showed a seasonal (P=0.014) and monthly (Speraman&#x02019;s rho (SR)=0.127; P=0.003) variation in distribution of serum 25-(OH)D. Age was positively correlated to increasing serum 25-(OH)D (SR=0.155; P&#x0003c; 0.001), vitamin D supplementation could possible explain this. Likewise was age at time of onset and increasing serum 25-(OH)D correlated (SR=0.090; P=0.035). There was no significant relation with sex, month of birth, course of disease or Kurtzke Score. A negative correlation was found with immunoglobulin G (IgG) index in cerebrospinal fluids (CSF) and serum 25-(OH)D (SR=&#x02212;0.302; P=0.035). In contrary, a higher number of demyelinising medullar MRI lesions were correlated to increased serum 25-(OH)D (SR=0.479; P=0.033). Both correlations were found in the date-adjusted material, which was weakened by smaller sample sizes. The number of cerebral MRI lesions were not significantly related to serum 25-(OH)D, although a trend was seen (SR=0.318; P=0.087). No significant differences were found with CSF oligoclonal bands, CSF leucocytes, evoked potentials or body mineral density.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Decreasing IgG index was correlated to increasing serum 25-(OH)D, which implies a protective role of vitamin D.

Relapses were defined as an abrupt symptom producing a change of 1 step or more in at least one Functional System, lasting at least 24 hours. Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores were also recorded for each patient.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The 754 relapsing-remitting MS patients had 186 relapses, for an anuual relapse rate of 0.25. 483 patients (64%) were being treated with a disease-modifying therapy (DMT). 74% of all relapses were treated with steroids. Prior to their relapse, the mean EDSS of all patients was 0.6 and 82% of patients had an EDSS of zero. The average EDSS score during a relapse worsened to 3.4. Then 83% of relapses recovered back to baseline, which took 6 weeks (range 1-20). 17% of relapses left permanent disability but with an average EDSS worsening of only 2.5. Only one patient became disabled (EDSS=6). The most common symptom was numbness (58%) followed by optic neuritis (16%). Patients treated with a DMT were only half as likely to have a relapse, but paradoxically the most disabling relapses occured in treated patients. 92% of all patients continued to work without missing any days of employment.The average cost of a relapse, including lost wages and non-medical expenses was $4,505. The average yearly cost of a DMT was $57,540.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The majority of patients with relapsing-remitting MS are normal (EDSS=0) before and after their relapse. Most relapses are mild, sensory, and transient. Over 3 years of observation only 31 (4%) of 754 patients had sustained worsening due to a relapse and only one became disabled. Thus, MS relapses can be distressing and occasionally disabling but they are ultimately benign in most patients.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section754-1352458514546077"><title>P373</title><sec id="section755-1352458514546077"><title>Specific clinical phenotypes of relapsing multiple sclerosis based on disease activity</title><p><underline>EJ Gettings</underline><sup>1</sup>, CT Hackett<sup>1,2</sup>, CJ Schramke<sup>1,3</sup>, TF Scott<sup>1,3</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Allegheny General Hospital, Neurology, Pittsburgh, PA, United States, <sup>2</sup>University of South Carolina, Columbia, SC, United States, <sup>3</sup>Drexel University College of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA, United States</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Progression occurring with or without clinical relapses creates complex patterns of disease course in individual patients which nonetheless may be stratified according to such patterns.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To identify and characterize clinical phenotypes of relapsing multiple sclerosis (MS) in a longitudinally designed retrospective study. We aimed to examine progression of disability over a number of years with particular attention to the possible contribution of relapse activity and severity to this progression.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> We recorded the clinical course of MS in groups of patients followed soon after initial diagnosis under the following clinical phenotypes: relapse-associated progression; progression without relapses (pure progression); relapse-associated progression and progression without relapses (mixed); relapse without progression (non-sustained progression); and no relapses or progression (disease free). The patients were further categorized as above according to five-year epochs of disease duration.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Of 176 patients followed longitudinally for 12.6&#x000b1;4.2 years, 92.6% (163/176) experienced some type of progression in their first 5 years of MS. Significantly less patients, 47.7% (84/176), suffered progression in the following five years of disease duration. Patients primarily progressed via relapse-associated progression in the first epoch, 65.6% (107/163), with equal amounts of pure and mixed progression, 17.2% (28/163), in each group. Eleven patients (6.3%) were disease free in the first epoch. In the second epoch, the majority of progressing patients, 61.9% (52/84), did so by pure progression with 29.8% (25/84) relapse-associated progression and 8.3% (7/84) mixed progression. A large portion of patients, 28.4% (50/176), were disease free in the second epoch. The mixed group was the most severe phenotype, with the highest relapse rate in epoch 1 (p &#x0003c; 0.001) and epoch 2 (p&#x0003c; 0.001). The mixed group also remained more disabled at final sustained visit in epoch 1 (p=0.04) and epoch 2 (p=0.03).

These ALCAM<sup>+</sup> B lymphocytes contain significantly more CD19<sup>+</sup>CD27<sup>+</sup>/CD24<sup>hi</sup>CD38<sup>-</sup> memory B lymphocytes. They were also significantly enriched in markers of activation, such as CD95, CD80 and CD86, as compared to ALCAM<sup>neg</sup> B cells.

Leukocytes recruitment is mediated by adhesion molecule expressed on endothelial-cells. Especially VCAM-1 because its concentration is correlated to disease activity and overexpression (one of the most early event in the disease course). Therefore imaging VCAM-1 expression may represent a new approach of MS disease.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> We validated the use of IV anti-VCAM-1 antibodies conjugated to 1&#x000b5;m sized MPIO to detect in vivo VCAM-1 expression in a EAE-mice MOG model at different stages of the disease. VCAM-1 expression was quantified using 3D T2*-weighted gradient echo imaging with flow compensation to visualize MPIOs carrying antibodies for brain, cerebellum and spinal cord and correlated to clinical scores. To evaluate the usefulness of the technique to assess drug effect on VCAM-1 expression, we test the impact of atorvastatin on the model at three different time (+10, 15 and 21D post-EAE induction, n=5/ group/ time). Atorvastatin has been described to decrease the expression of VCAM-1.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> We demonstrated that T2* weighted imaging with VCAM1 targeted MPIOs detects disease onset before any appearance of clinical symptoms. Subsequently, we observed increasing density and spatial extend of MPIOs binding together with aggravation of clinical symptoms: at disease onset, VCAM-1 detection spares the cerebellum and brain. When clinical symptoms appear, MPIOs binding extends already from the brain and cerebellum to the spinal cord. MPIO-VCAM-1-induced contrast reaches its maximum when mice were graded 4 to the EAE CS. During remitting phase, MPIOs binding decreases gradually but remains higher than in control mice even one month after disease activity peak. Atorvastatin induced a significant reduction of VCAM-1 expression on the whole central nervous system especially at the spinal cord level.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> We demonstrated that molecular MRI of VCAM-1 allows non-invasive assessment of early step of disease activity. This new tool provides additional information inaccessible to conventional used MRI techniques. A successful translation from bench to bedside could raise new avenue in trial design, treatment and MS patients&#x02019; management.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section765-1352458514546077"><title>P378</title><sec id="section766-1352458514546077"><title>ATX-MS-1467 reduces MRI lesions and prevents disease progression in a humanized mouse model of multiple sclerosis</title><p><underline>D Graham</underline><sup>1</sup>, S Huang<sup>1</sup>, J-K Choi<sup>2</sup>, S Rudin<sup>1</sup>, D Yu<sup>1</sup>, B Jenkins<sup>2</sup>, J Mandeville<sup>2</sup>, G Dai<sup>2</sup>, R Chang<sup>1</sup>, B Tomkinson<sup>1</sup>, T Dellovade<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>EMD Serono Research and Development Institute, Inc., Neurology eTIP, Translational &#x00026; Biomarker Research Group, Billerica, MA, United States, <sup>2</sup>Massachusetts General Hospital, Athinoula A.

ATX is a new therapeutic under investigation in clinical trials.

In non-treated EAE mice (N=21), MRI was performed at 7, 10, 14 or 22 days post-injection (dpi) to determine optimal time point for subsequent studies with ATX. In a separate group of mice (N=18), treatment with ATX (100 &#x000b5;g/mouse, subcutaneously) or vehicle (phosphate-buffered saline [PBS]) began at induction and was administered 3x/week until 14 days dpi. Disease severity was monitored daily (subjective 0-5 point scale); MRI was performed during the peak of disease (12, 13 or 14 dpi).

Treatment with ATX initiated at the time of induction reduced clinical disability compared with PBS-treated animals (p&#x0003c; 0.05) and prevented T1W Gd leakage in the cerebellum. ATX-treated mice had a significant reduction in Gd leakage volume (90.2% reduction) and in percent signal change (80.4% reduction) vs PBS-treated animals (p&#x0003c; 0.01).

Lately, the role of the environment within the human organism, the gut microbiome as a potential cause for complex disorders has gained attention. The microbiomic theory has, however, raised new questions, i.e. which factors fundamentally influence the composition of the gut microbiome in individuals and whether nutrition may beneficially influence the microbiome and course of disase.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> Recent findings suggest that fatty acids may the immune response, and hence, alter the natural course of immune related disorders. We investigated the role of short chain fatty acids (SCFA), in particular propionic acid (PA) on the course of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE).</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> MOG-immunized C57/Bl6-mice were either treated with PA from the day of immunization (prophylactic group; n=15), or the solvent (water control group; n=29), or with PA after onset of first EAE symptoms (therapeutic group; n=25) via oral gavage.

However, the therapeutic group did not reveal any significant differences to the water control group. Within the spinal cord we observed considerably less demyelination and axonal damage in the prophylactic group. So far, our results point to shift towards increased regulatory elements (Foxp3+ CD25+) within the gut compartment.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our findings suggest that SCFA as shown for PA may influence the course of EAE. First data point to a direct effect of SCFA on regulatory immune cells within the lamina propria of the gut. However, since SCFA are produced by resident gut bacteria from indigestible carbohydrates, e.g. vegetables, the question remains whether the effect seen in our setup may be partially due to the induction/proliferation of a certain phylum or class of bacteria that preferably produce SCFA. If so, change in diet may become an integral part of MS therapy in addition to immunomodulatory drugs.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section771-1352458514546077"><title>P381</title><sec id="section772-1352458514546077"><title>Laquinimod prevents disability progression in a model of spontaneous chronic EAE and interferes with the development of follicular helper T-cells</title><p><underline>M Varrin-Doyer</underline><sup>1</sup>, U Schulze Topphoff<sup>1</sup>, K Pekarek<sup>1</sup>, RA Sobel<sup>2</sup>, SS Zamvil<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>University of California, Neurology, San Francsico, CA, United States, <sup>2</sup>Stanford University, Pathology, Stanford, CA, United States</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Laquinimod is a novel oral agent with immunomodulatory properties that is being developed for the treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) and other inflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases. In two Phase 3 RRMS clinical trials, laquinimod has shown to be efficacious in reducing disease activity and progression. Previously, we demonstrated that laquinimod modulates adaptive T cell immune responses via its effects on antigen presenting cells (APC), including CD11c<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> dendritic cells (DC) that are known to participate in the generation of T follicular helper (Tfh) cells. Tfh cells are critical in B cell differentiation, germinal center formation and IgG class switching.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> Here, we investigated the effect of laquinimod on the generation of Tfh cells and the associated B cell differentiation in active EAE and in spontaneous opticospinal EAE (OSE).</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Acute EAE was examined in C57BL/6 mice by immunization with recombinant MOG. Spontaneous EAE was evaluated in MOG-specific TCR transgenic (2D2) x MOG-specific BCR knock-in (Th) mice, which develop chronic OSE.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> In acute EAE, laquinimod treatment was associated with decreased frequency of Tfh cells and reduced expression of BCL6, a transcriptional repressor that directs Tfh differentiation. Inhibition of Tfh differentiation by laquinimod was dependent upon its effects on APC. Production of interleukin (IL)-21,a Tfh cytokine that contributes to the formation and function of GC, was reduced upon treatment. Laquinimod also induced a decreased frequency of germinal center (GC) B cells that paralleled a reduction in anti-MOG IgG antibodies and clinical EAE. Oral laquinimod treatment reduced the incidence and severity of spontaneous OSE and was associated with reduction in Tfh cells, anti-MOG IgG antibodies and formation of meningeal follicle-like structures. When administered after onset, laquinimod inhibited progression of spontaneous OSE. This effect was also associated with decreased frequency of Tfh and GC B cells.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Laquinimod treatment of active EAE or spontaneous OSE interfered with the generation of Tfh cells, maturation of germinal center B cells and production of anti-MOG IgG. These findings indicate that laquinimod may be beneficial in modulating T-B interaction associated with MS progression.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section773-1352458514546077"><title>P382</title><sec id="section774-1352458514546077"><title>Oxysterols regulate T lymphocytes trafficking during experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis</title><p><underline>F Chalmin</underline><sup>1</sup>, V Rochemont<sup>1</sup>, C Lippens<sup>1</sup>, D Merkler<sup>1</sup>, S Hugues<sup>1</sup>, C Pot<sup>1,2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Geneva University, Department of Pathology and Immunology, Geneva, Switzerland, <sup>2</sup>Geneva University Hospitals, Division of Neurology, Geneva, Switzerland</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Serum oxysterols levels have been proposed as candidate biomarkers for neurological diseases such as Multiple sclerosis (MS). Oxysterols, oxidised forms of cholesterol, have recently been shown to modulate immune response. The enzyme cholesterol 25 hydroxylase (Ch25h) is the rate limiting step to synthetize 7&#x003b1;,25-dihydroxycholesterol (7&#x003b1;,25-OHC) from cholesterol. In addition to its basic metabolic properties in bile synthesis and sterol transportation, 7&#x003b1;,25-OHC guides macrophages, dendritic cells and B cells within germinal centers. However how oxysterols modulate adaptive immunity is largely unknown and their role in autoimmunity has not been evaluated.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> We proposed to assess the role of oxysterols and of Ch25h in the pathogenesis of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of multiple sclerosis and to investigate the underlying mechanisms.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> EAE model with MOG<sub>35-55</sub> peptide was performed in wild-type and Ch25h<sup>-/-</sup> mice on C57Bl6 background.

After implantation of the cOFM probe and a healing period of two weeks, rats were subclinically immunized with Myelin Oligodendrocyte Glycoprotein (MOG) in incomplete Freund&#x02019;s adjuvant. After establishing a stable IgG-antibody titre against MOG, the blood brain barrier was selectively opened by insertion of 250ng recombinant TNF-alpha and 150U IFN-g in phosphate buffered saline via the cOFM. This resulted in a selective opening of the blood brain barrier (BBB), influx of the anti-MOG antibodies and the formation of an inflammatory demyelinating lesion in direct vicinity of the cOFM catheter. MRI was performed before and 3, 6 and 10 days after opening of the BBB with the catheter in place to depict the development of the lesion. Proton density and T2 weighted MRI (in-plane resolution 150x150 mm) was performed at 3 Tesla using dedicated planar surface coils. Following MRI, animals were sacrificed and the brains underwent extensive histological analysis.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Histology revealed that first minimal inflammatory changes are detectable on day 3 after opening of the BBB and are fully established after day 6.

Gene expression profiling showed that Nurr1, an orphan nuclear receptor involved in Th17 differentiation, is down-regulated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of MS patients. Furthermore, Nurr1 exerts anti-inflammatory effects resulting in clearance of NF-kB and transcriptional repression. Nevertheless, its role in MS has not yet been clarified.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To better characterized the role of Nurr1 in MS, in this study we show the effect of a potent activator of the Nurr1 signaling pathway, isoxazolo-pyridinone 7e (IP7e), in a chronic murine model of MS (experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, EAE).</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Chronic progressive EAE was induced in 6-8 weeks old female C57BL/6J mice using myelin oligodentrocyte glycoprotein (MOG<sub>35-55</sub>). Two kind of IP7e gavage twice daily treatment were performed: preventive administration (before disease onset) from 7 to 23 days post immunization (dpi) and therapeutic (after disease onset) from 21 to 36 dpi. Control animals received the Tween 80 dissolved saline solution (0.9 % NaCl) twice daily. During treatments, body weight and clinical score were recorded daily.

We demonstrate that the preventive administration of IP7e delays the onset and reduces the incidence and the severity of EAE, improving neuroinflammatory and -pathological signs in EAE spinal cord of treated mice, whereas EAE course is not influenced by the therapeutic administration. Finally, the preventive administration of IP7e induces a down-regulation of NF-kB downstream genes in spinal cord supporting an inhibiting action on the NF-kB signaling due to a strong activation of Nurr1 pathway when administered before EAE onset.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our data and the evidences concerning the role of Nurr1 in T cells development and in its anti-inflammatory functions suggest a possible role of this activation pathway in the early phase of EAE, controlling the inflammation and the invasion of immunity component into the parenchyma.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section779-1352458514546077"><title>P385</title><sec id="section780-1352458514546077"><title>Neuroanatomical organization and global transcriptome analyses of c-Fos activated astrocytes in EAE lesions, altered by administration of fingolimod</title><p>A Groves<sup>1,2</sup>, Y Kihara<sup>1</sup>, M Mayford<sup>1</sup>, <underline>J Chun</underline><sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA, United States, <sup>2</sup>University of California San Diego, Neuroscience, La Jolla, CA, United States</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), a lysophospholipid, was shown to be relevant to multiple sclerosis (MS) therapeutics through oral fingolimod (FTY720), an S1P analog that upon phosphorylation can interact with four of five S1P receptors (S1PRs), S1P<sub>1,3-5</sub>. In addition to effects of lymphocyte retention in secondary lymphoid organs, fingolimod can enter the CNS to access S1PRs, notably S1P<sub>1</sub> on astrocytes, to produce internalization and functional receptor loss associated with fingolimod efficacy. Removal of S1P<sub>1</sub> on astrocytes ameliorates EAE severity and eliminates fingolimod efficacy, illustrating a key role of astrocytic S1P signaling in EAE and likely MS.

Activated astrocytes in the spinal cord were linearly correlated with EAE clinical score. Administration of fingolimod reduced the number of activated astrocytes while tracking with reduced clinical score. Astrocytic transcriptional changes occurred upon development of EAE signs, administration of fingolimod, and the selective removal of S1P<sub>1</sub> on astrocytes.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The c-Fos reporter mouse identified activated cell lineages during EAE that were predominantly astrocytes. This activity was responsive to S1P signaling disruption by fingolimod exposure or genetic removal of S1P<sub>1</sub> on astrocytes. Lesion sites were visualized. Transcriptome changes during EAE and in response to fingolimod were also determined.

In contrast, in laquinimod-treated immunized mice, NMOIg had no exacerbatory effect, and all mice survived. Spinal cords of mice receiving NMOIg displayed severe subpial and perivascular BBB breakdown and endothelial BBB tight junction disruption associated with complement fixation, loss of astrocytic AQP4, oligodendrocyte damage and demyelination. In contrast, in laquinimod-treated mice, neuropathology was greatly reduced.This effect correlated with restriction of BBB disruption in laquinimod-treated animals, and with laquinimod modulation of astrocytic production of inflammatory factors including VEGF-A in human cultures.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Collectively, our data demonstrate that laquinimod treatment prevents disease exacerbation in a model of NMO, and suggest rescue of BBB disruption as one mechanism of action.

In adoptive-transfer EAE, in which antigen-reactive T cells from wild-type mice were transferred to C6st1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and wild-type mice, phenotypes were significantly more severe in C6st1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> than in wild-type mice. The recall response of antigen-reactive T cells was not significantly different among the groups. Furthermore, the number of pathogenic T cells within the CNS was also not considerably different. When EAE was induced in C6ST1 transgenic mice with C6ST1 overexpression, the mice showed considerably milder symptoms compared with those in wild-type mice.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The presence of sulfate at position 6 of <italic>N</italic>-acetylgalactosamine of CSPG may influence the effecter phase of EAE to prevent the progression of pathogenesis. Thus, modification of the carbohydrate residue of CSPG may be a novel therapeutic strategy for neuroimmunological diseases such as multiple sclerosis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section791-1352458514546077"><title>P391</title><sec id="section792-1352458514546077"><title>Adaptive angioplasticity promotes recovery in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis</title><p><underline>N Esen</underline><sup>1</sup>, P Dore-Duffy<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Wayne State University, Detroit, MI, United States</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Infiltration of immune cells into the CNS in MS may lead to oxygen and glucose deprivation that promotes metabolic stress and tissue injury. Thus protective mechanisms that restore tissue homeostasis and cell plasticity have been shown to promote recovery in models of ischemic injury. One such mechanism is the induction of adaptive angioplasticity induced by exposure to mild stress signals (stress conditioning). We hypothesize that adaptive angioplasticity will ameliorate experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in mice through a Hypoxia Inducible Factor-1alpha (HIF-1a)/HIF-2a-dependent manner. While the exact mechanisms responsible for HIF-1a-induced protection are unclear it has been shown that the interaction between HIF-1a and reactive oxygen species (ROS) is important for restoring homeostasis. Thus angioplasticity may promote cell survival as a result of restoration of cell and mitochondrial stability and bioenergetic homeostasis.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> Evaluate the effect of adaptive angioplasty in a neurodegenerative disease model of multiple sclerosis (MS).</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> C57BL/6 mice were immunized with MOG35-55 peptide.

MitoSox staining as an indicator of ROS production and mitochondrial damage was found decreased in hypoxia exposed animals.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Adaptive angioplasticity promotes recovery of EAE in a HIF-1 dependent manner. Our data suggest that the interaction between HIF-1a and ROS is important for maintenance of homeostasis and energy balance.

Besides being a potent anti-inflammatory drug, it may reduce neurodegeneration, but the mechanism for that effect is not fully understood. Recent evidences suggest the potential role of mitochondria in MS-associated neuronal degeneration. Mitochondria undergo frequent fusion and fission, and the balance of these opposing processes plays a critical role in maintaining functional mitochondria when cells experience metabolic or environmental stresses. Mitochondrial fission facilitates apoptosis, whereas mitochondrial fusion plays a protective role. However, the tendency and molecular basis of mitochondrial dynamic change in the CNS after MS and after GA treatment have not been elucidated.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> Determine the effect of GA treatment on mitochondrial dynamics and biogenesis in experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model for MS.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> EAE was induced in C57Bl/6 female mice by immunization with myelin oligodendroglial glycoprotein peptide 35-55.

Mice were euthanized on day 20 of GA treatment and lumbar spinal cords were examined histologically.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> GA treatment significantly reduced inflammation and demyelination in EAE. More Myelin Basic Protein expression was seen in GA treated EAE spinal cords compared to untreated. GA treated EAE mice showed decreased Mitochondrial Fis1 and DNM1-L (markers of mitochondrial fission) and increased Mito fusion-2 and OPA-1(markers of fusion) compared with untreated EAE mice . GA treatment increased the levels of sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma co-activator 1 alpha (PGC-1&#x003b1;) and nuclear respiratory factor 2 (NRF-2), indicators of mitochondrial biogenesis.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Herein, we show that GA treatment upregulates mitochondrial biogenesis, increases fusion and decreases fission; which correlates with the functional outcome of the disease. These results not only demonstrate a mechanism of action of GA but also provide a good target to prevent neurodegeneration in EAE and MS.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section797-1352458514546077"><title>P394</title><sec id="section798-1352458514546077"><title>Superior efficacy of glucocorticoid treatment of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in macrophage migration inhibitory factor deficient mice</title><p><underline>N Ji</underline><sup>1</sup>, TG Forsthuber<sup>2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>University of Texas at San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, United States, <sup>2</sup>University of Texas at San Antonio, Biology, San Antonio, TX, United States</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is a proinflammatory cytokine with the unique property of being induced by glucocorticoids (GCs) and the ability to counter-regulate their anti-inflammatory effects. GCs are the standard treatment for acute attacks of multiple sclerosis (MS), however, they eventually lose efficacy and overall do not prevent long-term progression of the disease. Additionally, GC treatment has numerous side effects and some patients develop GC resistance.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> We wanted to determine whether MIF plays a role in resistance to GC treatment using experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a common animal model of MS.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> We induced EAE in both Wt and MIF knockout (MIF-/-) C57BL/6 mice followed by the treatment of dexamethasone (Dex) before or upon the onset of disease. Splenocytes and brain mononuclear cells were harvested for cytokine ELISPOT assay, flow cytometry analysis and immunofluorescence staining.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Treatment of EAE with Dex in MIF-/- mice was substantially more efficacious as compared with Wt mice in delaying EAE onset and decreasing disease severity. Dex treatment suppressed inflammatory infiltration in both the brains of Wt and MIF-/- mice; however, the suppression lasted longer in MIF-/- mice once the treatment was stopped. In contrast, antigen-specific cytokine production by T cells was partially suppressed by Dex and slightly affected by MIF deficiency. Importantly, Dex profoundly inhibited the upregulation of transcription factor T-bet in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from the brains of MIF-/- mice as compared with Wt mice. Furthermore, adoptive transfer studies showed that Dex inhibited EAE in MIF-/- mice mainly by downregulating pathogenicity of MOG<sub>35-55</sub>-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells rather than effects on central nervous system.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our data suggest that MIF promotes EAE and possibly MS by antagonizing GC effects on the pathogenicity of autoreactive T cell in EAE.

DIV14-17 cultures were treated with excitatory (potassium chloride, 4-aminopryridine), inflammatory or oxidative stimuli and ARNT2 expression was examined by western blotting and immunocytochemistry.

Mouse neuronal cultures were coincubated with resting or anti-CD3 activated spleen cells to test the influence of soluble inflammatory mediators on ARNT2 expression and cell viability.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Potassium chloride had no effect on ARNT2 expression, whereas 4-aminopyridine enhanced ARNT2 expression by 50% at 3hrs and dropped thereafter. Oxidative stress mimicked by exposure of cells to 30 or 300uM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> for increasing periods of time had differential effects on ARNT2 expression. A &#x0201c;stressing&#x0201d; exposure of 30uM briefly increased ARNT2 expression at 1-2 hrs but thereafter had no effect on ARNT2 or LDH levels. 300uM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> raised ARNT2 expression very shortly after exposure in a neuroprotective manner, and extended exposure led to a 50% reduction in ARNT2 expression by 4 hours and complete loss of ARNT2 by 8 hrs. This correlated with decreasing nuclear size, retraction of dendrites stained with MAP2, increased levels of LDH release into the media and ultimately cell death. Coincubation of neuronal cells with anti-CD3 activated spleen cells increased ARNT2 expression at about 3 hrs but dropped thereafter as death became apparent.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> These studies identify a correlation between ARNT2 expression and inflammatory stimuli which alter neuronal viability and function.

Bach1 is the transcriptional repressor of heme oxygenase-1 (HMOX1), an Nrf2-driven cytoprotective gene. Bach1 deficiency in mice confers cytoprotection against spinal cord injury and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). We therefore designed potent and specific inhibitors of Bach1 to evaluate as a treatment for MS.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> Determine the pharmacodynamic and therapeutic effects of Bach1 inhibitor HPP971 after oral administration in na&#x000ef;ve and EAE mice.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Recombinant human MBP-Bach1 protein was overexpressed in E.coli and purified using a protein fusion tag. Direct binding of HPP971 was measured using microscale thermophoresis. HMOX1, NQO1, and GCLC gene expression were measured in human astrocytes <italic>in vitro</italic> and in mouse tissues using the Quantigene Reagent 2.0 system (Affymetrix). Human primary astrocytes were treated with HPP971 for 6 hr for reduced glutathione (GSH) measurement and 24 hr for assessment of cytoprotection against H2O2 by propidium iodide staining. In an EAE model, C57Bl/6 female mice were immunized with MOG peptide 35-55/CFA on day 1. HPP971 dosing was on day 2 through day 20.

The GALT serves as an important reservoir for both T and B regulatory cell populations. The interaction between the commensal microflora and the gut associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) or gut microbiome is of critical importance in a range of experimental conditions including obesity and autoimmunity. The functional properties of GALT derived regulatory populations and the phenotypic characteristics of APCs in EAE and human MS are not appreciated. Alemtuzumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting the co-stimulatory molecule CD52, significantly reduces the risk of relapse and accumulation of disability. Preliminary reports from our lab demonstrate a rise in IL-10 producing CD39+ regulatory cells following treatment with alemtuzumab. Recent studies by Turner et al have demonstrated that murine anti-CD52 (m-anti CD52) mAb treatment reduces autoreactive MOG specific T cells and diminished lymphocyte infiltration into the CNS. Although the peripheral lymphocyte count drops substantially following anti-CD52 infusion the extent to which CD52 expressing cells are eliminated in the GALT is unknown. Thus GALT may represent the reservoir for the regulatory phase in EAE mice that have been treated with m-anti-CD52.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To assess the impact of recently developed m-anti-CD52 mAb on GALT mediated immune regulatory cell populations in EAE.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> C57BL/6 mice were immunized with MOG 35-55 peptide to induce EAE and treated therapeutically with m-anti-CD52 antibody.

A less pronounced increase was induced by GA. In EAE mice, PA administration increased serum levels of CCL22 at 15 minutes following injection, while GA had no effect. CXCL13 was also raised in EAE mice compared with healthy control mice. However, the levels of this cytokine were not altered by treatment with PA or GA.

In the present study we monitored a model of MS induced in Dark-Agouti (DA) rats with another compound, i.e. spinal cord homogenate (SCH).</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To show optic nerve involvement and assess VEP usefulness as neurophysiological biomarker in a relapsing remitting model of MS induced with spinal cord homogenate (SCH).</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Nineteen DA rats were used in the experiment: 7 immunized by SCH (EAE) and 12 healthy (H) controls. Flash VEPs from both eyes were recorded with epidural electrodes under sevoflurane volatile anesthesia once a week for 6 weeks (one day before immunization, days 6, 13, 20, 27, 34 post) with measurement P1 latency from N1-P1-N2 complex. Values exceeding 2.5 SD from control mean were considered abnormal. MRI analyses on both Optic Nerves were also performed using a 7 Tesla technology. After the last VEP session, 7 EAE and 3 H animals underwent histological analysis on a transverse section of both optic nerves.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> P1 latency in EAE group was significantly increased at days 13-20-27 post immunization and was abnormal in 10/14 eyes in EAE rats (p&#x0003c; 0.05). Neither histology nor VEPs showed pathologic findings in any H control. MRI analysis showed Fractional Anistropy (FA) and Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) pathological values in EAE rats, too. Histological optic nerve damage was found in 6/14 eyes in EAE, with a 57% agreement between VEPs and histologic data. Considering histology data as the gold standard, in our EAE model VEPs showed a sensitivity of 83% and a specificity of 37%.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our data show optic nerve involvement in SCH EAE in DA rats. VEPs latencies are significantly delayed in EAE and show a good sensitivity in identifying affected eyes such as MRI analysis. Suboptimal agreement between histology and VEPs and lowest VEP specificity are probably due to single optic nerve sections that may underestimate actual optic nerve involvement, because of patchy disease pattern. On the other hand, VEPs abnormalities may also derive from lesions affecting the visual pathways behind the optic chiasm. In any case, these findings suggest that VEPs could be a useful tool in monitoring the disease course in SCH-EAE and prompt further studies specifically addressing their value in testing novel treatments.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section813-1352458514546077"><title>P402</title><sec id="section814-1352458514546077"><title>Spectroscopic determination of chelating properties and uptake in the cuprizone multiple sclerosis model</title><p><underline>AA Taraboletti</underline><sup>1</sup>, JA Caporoso<sup>1</sup>, H Huang<sup>1</sup>, MJ Taschner<sup>1</sup>, TL Walker<sup>2</sup>, CJ Ziegler<sup>1</sup>, LP Shriver<sup>1,3</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>University of Akron, Chemistry, Akron, OH, United States, <sup>2</sup>Indiana University Northwest, Chemistry, Gary, IN, United States, <sup>3</sup>University of Akron, Biology, Akron, OH, United States</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> The copper chelator, cuprizone, has been used for almost 50 years as a model to study pathways involved in white matter damage that occurs in multiple sclerosis (MS). Administration of cuprizone to mice results in reproducible and selective damage to the oligodendrocyte, while withdrawal from mouse feed induces spontaneous remyelination. Despite the extensive use of this model to test neuroprotective therapies, little is known of its structure or its mechanism of action.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To determine cuprizone&#x02019;s structural properties and chelating ability using copper-containing active site mimics as well as quantifying cuprizone uptake in cells and tissues.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Cuprizone&#x02019;s structure in solution was analyzed using both quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry (QToF-MS), and proton nuclear magnetic resonance (H-NMR) spectroscopy. The ability of this compound to bind copper-bound protein active site mimics was also monitored using H-NMR and absorption spectroscopy.</p><p>Quantification of cellular uptake was determined in MO3.13 cells, a human oligodendrocyte cell line using a copper-dependent colorimetric assay based on the strong absorbance at 600 nm for the copper-cuprizone complex. These levels were confirmed by selected reaction monitoring (SRM) with liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS).</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> QToF-MS revealed the copper-cuprizone complex to exist as multiple hydrolyzed forms in solution at pH 7.5-8. Cuprizone is able to lose one or both of its cyclohexane rings when bound to copper. When cuprizone is added to synthetic protein active sites that contain copper, a structural change occurs which is observable using both absorption spectroscopy and H-NMR. Cuprizone does not seem able to remove copper from the site, but instead forms a complex, coordinating to the metal.</p><p>The colorimetric assay displayed a loss of cuprizone in the cell media indicating that is compound can cross the cell membrane. This uptake was associated with loss of viability. Selected reaction monitoring quantified the cellular level of cuprizone to be approximately 30 nM.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our chemical investigation determined that cuprizone is taken up by cells; however, it cannot chelate away copper from enzyme active sites and instead forms a complex. These results indicate a more complicated mechanism of action than simple metal chelation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section815-1352458514546077"><title>P403</title><sec id="section816-1352458514546077"><title>Well-defined functional deficits and protracted course of EAE in rats with intraspinal injection of VEGF after low-dose immunization with MOG</title><p><underline>S Kapitza</underline><sup>1</sup>, B Z&#x000f6;rner<sup>2</sup>, C Bleul<sup>3</sup>, B Ineichen<sup>3</sup>, ME Schwab<sup>3</sup>, M Linnebank<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>University Hospital Zurich, Neurology, Zurich, Switzerland, <sup>2</sup>University Zurich, Balgrist Hospital, Zurich, Switzerland, <sup>3</sup>University Zurich, Brain Research Institute, Zurich, Switzerland</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> The targeted experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model in rats is a variant of EAE, which reflects the pathological hallmarks of EAE but allows defining the localization and onset of the lesion.

Susceptibility to disseminated EAE was strikingly higher in other rat strains (SD, LE, DA) than in LEW rats. Apart from rat strain and antigen dosage, the targeted EAE model was prone to several factors including animal supplier, housing conditions and stress levels (e.g. behavior testing). Intraspinal injections of VEGF in combination with IFN-&#x003b3; and TNF-&#x003b1; led to accentuated pathophysiological characteristics of the targeted EAE lesion and protracted the lesion outcome without increasing the dissemination rate, whereas injections of cytokines-only led to little demyelination and rapid spontaneous functional recovery. The amount of spared CST fibers which were identified by anterograde tracing was strikingly reduced. These histological alterations were closely related to marked functional forelimb deficits reflected by a success rate of only 1.8% on the horizontal ladder at day 2 post operation followed by a rapid and progressive spontaneous recovery with back to 70.4% and 79.9% correct steps on the horizontal ladder on day 14 and 28 post operation respectively.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Once shielded from environmental variables, the targeted EAE model is highly reproducible and helpful to mimic a predictable onset and phenotype of an experimental MS.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section817-1352458514546077"><title>P404</title><sec id="section818-1352458514546077"><title>Clinical outcome of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in semaphorin 7A-deficient mice</title><p><underline>A Guti&#x000e9;rrez-Franco</underline><sup>1</sup>, H Eixarch<sup>1</sup>, C Costa<sup>1</sup>, M Casillo<sup>1</sup>, X Montalban<sup>1</sup>, C Espejo<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Vall Hebron University Hospital, Multiple Sclerosis Centre of Catalonia, Neuroimmunology Department, Barcelona, Spain</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Semaphorin 7A (sema7A) is an immune semaphorin that is also involved in glial scar formation after a central nervous system (CNS) injury.

Additionally, different doses of antigen and adjuvants were used to determine the relevance of the immunization protocol in the establishment and development of EAE (as it is described in the literature): 1, 10, 50 and 100&#x000b5;g of MOG<sub>35-55</sub>, 100&#x000b5;g of McT and 100ng of Pt. On day 12 post-immunization, spleens from 4-6 mice were removed to evaluate their proliferative capacity upon MOG- and PHA-stimulation by measuring <sup>3</sup>H-thymidine incorporation. Cytokine release was assessed by flow cytometry in the supernatants of MOG-stimulated splenocytes and CNS histophatological studies were performed at the end of the experiment.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Sema7AKO and WT mice immunized with our current protocol exhibited a similar clinical outcome. The use of other doses of antigen and adjuvants reported no differences between sema7AKO and WT mice when the incidence, the onset day, the accumulated score, the maximum score and the mortality were compared. Sema7AKO or WT mice immunized with 1ug did not develop EAE. Proliferation of splenocytes from sema7AKO mice upon both MOG- and PHA-stimulation was reduced compared with WT, being statistically significant in mice immunized with 50&#x000b5;g of MOG-peptide, 100&#x000b5;g McT and 100ng of Pt (MOG: p=0.017; PHA: p=0.022). Similarly, the levels of IFN-g and TNF-a proinflammatory cytokines were decreased in all groups of sema7AKO mice, although the differences did not reach statistical significance respect to those observed in WT mice. No differences were found in the histopathological studies between sema7AKO and WT mice.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our results show that sema7A modulates the immune response during EAE favoring T-cell responses as determined by T-cell proliferation assay and cytokine release determination. Moreover, the absence of sema7A does not ameliorate nor abrogate EAE symptoms, suggesting that this molecule is not crucial for EAE outcome.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section819-1352458514546077"><title>P405</title><sec id="section820-1352458514546077"><title>Gender-specific neuregulin1 modulation of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis</title><p><underline>F Song</underline><sup>1</sup>, H Deol<sup>1</sup>, J Liu<sup>1</sup>, EH Simpson<sup>2</sup>, JA Loeb<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>University of Illinois at Chicago, Neurology and Rehabilitation, Chicago, IL, United States, <sup>2</sup>Columbia University, Psychiatry, New York, NY, United States</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> The mechanisms that modulate disease severity and progression in multiple sclerosis (MS) are poorly understood and MS is more common in women than men. One potential mediator is neuregulin1 (NRG1) which is a membrane bound and secreted growth and differentiation factor that regulates glial development, survival, synaptogenesis, axoglial interactions, and microglial activation. We developed a targeted NRG1 antagonist called HBD-S-H4 that given intrathecally reduces microglial activation in a rat spinal cord pain model, suggesting that it may have similar effects in other diseases. Here we test the hypothesis that blocking NRG1 in the central nervous system (CNS) could be a therapeutic approach to reduce neuroinflammation and demyelination in MS. Since sex steroids can also modulate microglial activation, it will be important to examine any sex differences.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To determine the gender-specific effects of a NRG1 antagonist (HBD-S-H4) on myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)-induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE).</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> HBD-S-H4 is a novel humanized fusion protein consisting of a decoy Her4 receptor fused to NRG1&#x02019;s heparin-binding, targeting domain. MOG-induced EAE was induced in transgenic mice that were developed to express this fusion protein in the CNS, and compared to control mice. More and less potent EAE disease induction models were compared as well as gender-specific differences.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Transgenic expression of HBD-S-H4 in the CNS did not result in any significant neurological or other overt phenotypes. With induction of less potent EAE disease, female HBD-S-H4 mice were less severely affected compared to their male HBD-S-H4 littermates. However, with more potent disease induction, female HBD-S-H4 mice were affected more than the males of the same genotype, suggesting complex interaction between NRG1 signaling and gender.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Blocking NRG1 is protective in female mice in mild disease, but this effect was not seen in more severe disease, suggesting a complex interplay between NRG1 and sex hormones in EAE that is dependent on disease severity. One possible explanation for this may be from combined effects of NRG1 and estrogens on microglia. Future studies of gender and hormonal influences on NRG1 signaling in microglia will be important to understand the heterogeneity of disease pathology and the therapeutic potential of targeting microglial activation in human MS in men and women.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section821-1352458514546077"><title>P406</title><sec id="section822-1352458514546077"><title>Oleanolic acid controls oxidative stress to protect against optic nerve degeneration in an experimental model of multiple sclerosis</title><p>C Cordova<sup>1</sup>, B Gutierrez<sup>2</sup>, R Martin<sup>3</sup>, M Hernandez<sup>2</sup>, N Tellez<sup>4</sup>, <underline>ML Nieto</underline><sup>2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>IBGM-CSIC/Uva, I3U, Valladolid, Spain, <sup>2</sup>IBGM-CSIC/UVa, I3U, Valladolid, Spain, <sup>3</sup>Hospital Clinico Universitario, Valladolid, Spain, <sup>4</sup>Hospital Clinico Universitario, Neurologia, Valladolid, Spain</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Optic neuritis (ON) is a frequent and early symptom of multiple sclerosis (MS). ON is a condition involving inflammation, oxidative stress, demyelination, and axonal injury in the optic nerve and leads to apoptotic retinal ganglion cell (RGC) death, which contributes to the persistence of visual loss. Currently, ON has no effective treatment. Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is the animal model used to study MS and ON. The triterpene, oleanolic acid (OA), has proven effective in EAE via an immunomodulatory and antiinflammatory mechanism.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> Our goal was to determine the usefulness of OA in preventing ON with a focus on neuroprotection.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> OA (50 mg/kg/day) was intraperitoneally administered to MOG<sub>35-55</sub> immunized-C57/BL6 mice from immunization to day 21. Clinical score, as well as cell infiltration (hematoxylin/eosin, H&#x00026;E), myelin lost (Luxol fast blue, LFB) and oxidative stress (dichlorofluorescein diacetate, DCFDA, and dihydroethidium, DHE) were analyzed in the optic nerve from untreated and OA-treated EAE mice. A RGC cell line was used to measure effectiveness of OA in vitro.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> High levels of ROS were detected in optic nerve sections from EAE mice, compared to healthy mice, and were strongly attenuated in samples from OA-treated EAE mice. Histopathological analysis of optic nerves showed presence of cell infiltration (H&#x00026;E) and myelin loss (LFB stain) in EAE mice, whereas these effects were not detectable in tissue sections from healthy or OA-treated EAE mice. In addition, OA intervention suppressed lymphocyte proliferation (1.2<underline>+</underline>0.1, 2.6<underline>+</underline>0.4 and 1.4<underline>+</underline>0.2, in control, EAE and OA-treated EAE mice, respectively, p&#x0003c; 0.001). At the same time, studies in vitro showed ROS accumulation in the RGC-5 cell line by addition of 500 &#x000b5;M hydrogen peroxide for 24 h (23<underline>+</underline>2% of cells were positives for DCF fluorescence and 53<underline>+</underline>4% for DHE), which resulted in significant apoptotic cell loss (65<underline>+</underline>7% were stained with annexin-V). The presence of 10 &#x000b5;M of OA or 5 mM of NAC reduced ROS levels at resting situation (0.2% of cells positives for DCF and DHE fluorescence) and promoted cell survival (only 8<underline>+</underline>0.5% and 7.5<underline>+</underline>0.3% stained with annexin-V, respectively) in RGC-5 cells (p&#x0003c; 0.001).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> OA suppressed clinical and histopathologic signs of ON preventing recruitment of inflammatory cells to the optic nerve, ameliorating production/accumulation of ROS, and restraining myelin fiber injury.

The mechanisms by which B cells participate in neuro-inflammatory responses in MS remain unclear.

We initially reported that B cell antigen presentation is not sufficient to support disease in the animal model of MS, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE).

Their altered expression induced by pathologic stimuli is thought to play a major role in cell injury and death in a number of chronic neurodegenerative conditions. Notably, TGM6, which is expressed predominately by neuronal cells under physiological conditions, has been implicated in cerebellar ataxia and schizophrenia.

It is not known, whether these results are also applicable to MS patients.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> Using interferon beta-1b-treated RRMS and CIS subjects from the BEYOND and BENEFIT trials, we analyzed candidate SNPs to assess their impact on 25(OH)D levels. Also, a 25(OH)D genetic risk score was implemented for patient stratification.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> 25(OH)D levels were measured at two to three time points during the trials using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay or a chemiluminescence-based immunoassay and seasonally adjusted to derive an averaged 25(OH)D levels for each patient. Eligible data were combined and resulted in 819 unique patients for whom data was available. 25(OH)D values were log<sub>e</sub>-transformed and modeled as a function of candidate SNPs using Gaussian linear models. The first two ancestry components were included as covariates to correct for population stratification (resulting &#x003bb;<sub>GC</sub>~1.03), as were gender, age, treatment and maximum NAb titer under treatment within the period of time 25(OH)D was measured in.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> All assessed candidate SNPs were significantly associated with 25(OH)D levels with p &#x02264; 0.05. The most significant SNPs were located within the genomic region incorporating gene GC (coding for vitamin D binding protein) with p = 1.05*10<sup>-6</sup> for SNP rs17467825. 25(OH)D levels were reduced by 10% comparing one to zero risk allele copies. In the genomic region of gene DHCR7, rs4945008 was the most significantly associated SNP with p=6.1*10<sup>-4</sup> and a reduction of 25(OH)D by 7%. With respect to the genomic risk region incorporating gene CYP2R1, the most significant SNP was rs1993116 with p=4.7*10<sup>-3</sup> and a reduction of 25(OH)D levels by 6%. The cumulative count of risk alleles per patient was used to derive a 25(OH)D risk score and indicate the odds ratio of being 25(OH)D deficient. For example, the odds ratio for a risk score of 4 relative to risk score 0 is OR=5.29 (p=1.05*10<sup>-5</sup>).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> All candidate SNPs were significantly associated with 25(OH)D levels at the nominal level. The genetic background and derived 25(OH)D risk score of patients and their first degree relatives could help to assess individual risk of 25(OH)D deficiency.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section834-1352458514546077"><title>P412</title><sec id="section835-1352458514546077"><title>Multiple quantitative trait loci for anti-EBNA-1 IgG titres are associated with risk of multiple sclerosis</title><p><underline>Y Zhou</underline><sup>1</sup>, G Zhu<sup>2</sup>, DR Nyholt<sup>2</sup>, J Charlesworth<sup>1</sup>, S Simpson Jr<sup>1</sup>, I van der Mei<sup>1</sup>, NA Patsopoulos<sup>3</sup>, C Laverty<sup>4</sup>, A Henders<sup>2</sup>, J Ellis<sup>2</sup>, GW Montgomery<sup>2</sup>, R Rubicz<sup>5</sup>, J Blangero<sup>6</sup>, HHH G&#x000f6;ring<sup>6</sup>, NG Martin<sup>2</sup>, BV Taylor<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Menzies Research Institute Tasmania, Hobart, Australia, <sup>2</sup>Queensland Institute of Medical Research, Genetic Epidemiology, Molecular Epidemiology and Neurogenetics Laboratories, Queensland, Australia, <sup>3</sup>Brigham &#x00026; Women&#x02019;s Hospital, Program in Translational NeuroPsychiatric Genomics, Institute for the Neuroscience, Department of Neurology, Boston, MA, United States, <sup>4</sup>Monash University, Monash Antibody Technologies Facility, Melbourne, Australia, <sup>5</sup>Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, United States, <sup>6</sup>Texas Biomedical Research Institute, Department of Genetics, San Antonio, TX, United States</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a ubiquitous double-stranded DNA virus and infection with EBV is associated with an increased risk of multiple sclerosis (MS).</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To identify genetic susceptibility loci for EBV nuclear antigen-1 IgG antibody titres (EBNA-1) and hypothesised that these loci may play an important role in MS risk.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Approximately 2.4 million SNPs were tested for their association with ELISA measured anti-EBNA-1 IgG titres in 3,760 individuals from a large unselected twin family cohort.

Finally, we examined the shared polygenic risk utilising our EBNA-1 meta results (effective sample size=5,555) with the results of a large, well-validated MS meta-analysis (effective sample size=15,365) to determine the genetic architecture of anti-EBNA-1 immune responses, and whether these loci were over-represented in MS cases compared to healthy controls, thus representing novel MS susceptibility loci.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> We identified one locus of strong association within the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region, of which the most significantly associated genotyped SNP was rs2516049 (P=4.11&#x000d7;10<sup>-9</sup>), <italic>cis</italic>-eQTL analysis revealed that rs2516049 consistently changed the expression of the nearby gene, <italic>HLA-DRB1</italic>, using three different expression datasets.

Genomic regions containing CNVs collectively span between 10 and -20% of the genome and contribute to human genetic and phenotypic diversity, including disease susceptibility. Although susceptibility CNVs have been reported in several diseases, the effect of CNVs on susceptibility to multiple sclerosis (MS) and neuromyelitis optica (NMO) is unknown.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To identify CNVs associated with MS and NMO and to clarify the correlation between CNVs and clinical phenotypes.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> We performed a genome-wide association study of CNVs among 277 MS patients, 135 NMO/NMO spectrum disorder (NMOSD) patients, and 288 healthy individuals as a discovery cohort, and then among 296 MS patients, 76 NMO/NMOSD patients, and 790 healthy individuals as a replication cohort in Japan using high-density microarrays, containing 700 K probes corresponding to known SNPs.

Most were deletions of 5-50 kb in size at particular regions of the T cell receptor (TCR) gamma and alpha genes. Among these CNVs, a deletion within the TCR gamma gene was found in 16.40% of all MS patients (combined p = 2.4E-40, combined odds ratio (OR) = 52.6, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 19.7-198.6). Deletion within the TCR alpha gene was found in 17.28% of all MS patients (combined p = 1.7E-31, combined OR = 13.0, 95% CI = 7.6-23.5) and 13.27% of all NMO/NMOSD patients (combined p = 5.8E-20, combined OR = 54.6, 95% CI = 16.6-281.5). These findings were confirmed by quantitative PCR at the same genomic regions. In addition, NMO/NMOSD patients carrying the most significant CNVs were seronegative for anti-aquaporin 4 antibody or had lower titers than those without significant CNVs (mean &#x000b1; SEM by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay: 65.4 &#x000b1; 22.7 U/mL vs. 565.4 &#x000b1; 195.0 U/mL, respectively, p = 0.0146).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Deletion-type CNVs within specific regions of TCR genes may lead to skewed usage of the TCR repertoire, followed by emergence of T cells expressing autoreactive pathogenic TCRs in Japanese patients with MS and NMO.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section844-1352458514546077"><title>P417</title><sec id="section845-1352458514546077"><title>Genetic interaction analysis of multiple sclerosis risk loci</title><p>M Lind&#x000e9;n<sup>1</sup>, I Lima Bomfim<sup>1</sup>, J Hillert<sup>1</sup>, L Alfredsson<sup>2</sup>, T Olsson<sup>1</sup>, <underline>I Kockum</underline><sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Karolinska Institutet, Clinical Neuroscience, Stockholm, Sweden, <sup>2</sup>Karolinska Institutet, Institute of Environmental Medicine, Stockholm, Sweden</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> The sibling recurrence risk for multiple sclerosis (MS) is estimated to be 7.1.

Susceptibility to MS is thought to be influenced by both environmental and genetic factors. Ethnicity is one of such risk factors. MS is most prevalent among people of Northern European descent, and uncommon in people of Asian. While genetic risk variants for MS have been identified among people of European descent by genome-wide association study (GWAS), the variants are not elucidated among Asians.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To clarify susceptibility variants for Japanese MS by GWAS and replication or difference of the risks between people of European descent and Japanese.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Genome-wide SNPs were genotyped in 275 MS cases and 974 controls for a discovery dataset and in 297 cases and 944 controls for a replication dataset in the Japanese population and the allelic effects for MS were calculated.

The main genetic locus for MS (the <italic>HLA-DRB1</italic> gene) was discovered in the 1970s within the major histocompatibility complex region. Two genome wide association studies (GWAS) published in 2011 provided evidence for approximately 60 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) influencing MS risk. An updated GWAS has recently increased the number of known MS associated variants to 110.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> We aimed to estimate what proportion of the general population can be considered at increased risk of MS and whether the predictive performance of MS associations has increased now that their number has exceeded 100.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> We used summary statistics from GWAS in MS to estimate the distribution of risk within a large simulated general population. We profiled MS associated loci in 70 MS patients and 79 healthy controls (HC) and assessed their position within the distribution of risk in the simulated population. The predictive performance of a weighted genetic risk score (wGRS) on disease status was investigated using receiver operating characteristic statistics.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> When all known variants were considered, 40.8% of the general population was predicted to be at reduced risk, 49% at average, 6.9% at elevated and 3.3% at high risk of MS. Fifty percent of MS patients were at either reduced or average risk of disease. The median wGRS in MS was higher than in HC (13.47 vs 12.46, p=4.08x10<sup>-10</sup>). The area under the curve (AUC) discriminating MS and HC increased with the increasing number of considered MS associations (<italic>HLA-DRB1</italic> only, AUC=70.8%; <italic>HLA-DRB1</italic>+SNPs known in 2011, AUC=76.6%; <italic>HLA-DRB1</italic>+all currently known SNPs, AUC=79.7%).

The predictive performance of the wGRS improved with the increasing number of discovered associations and the best threshold was 71.4% sensitive and 78.5% specific. However, given the low prevalence of MS, the positive predictive value was very low. Genetics is still unlikely to be useful for disease prediction in clinical settings and a more complete understanding of the complexity of MS is needed.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section852-1352458514546077"><title>P421</title><sec id="section853-1352458514546077"><title>The PhenoGenetic Project: a biobank with which to investigate the genetic and environmental architecture of immune variation in multiple sclerosis</title><p><underline>PA Winn</underline><sup>1</sup>, M Cimpean<sup>1</sup>, A Robbins<sup>1</sup>, T Xue<sup>1,2</sup>, P de Jager<sup>1,2,3</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Brigham and Women&#x02019;s Hospital, Center for Neurologic Diseases, Boston, MA, United States, <sup>2</sup>Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, United States, <sup>3</sup>Brigham and Women&#x02019;s Hospital, Program in Translational NeuroPsychiatric Genomics, Institute for the Neurosciences, Department of Neurology and Psychiatry, Boston, MA, United States</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Multiple genetic as well as environmental factors influence susceptibility to multiple sclerosis (MS).

Interleukin-1R like receptors ligand family includes pro-inflammatory molecules such as IL-1&#x003b1; and IL-1&#x003b2; (IL-1F1), IL-18/IL-1F4, IL-36&#x003b1;/IL-1F6, IL-36&#x003b2;/IL-1F8, and IL-36&#x003b3;/IL-1F9. Other members of the IL-1 family show anti-inflammatory activity. What is important is that all cells of the innate immune system express and/or are affected by IL-1 family members. Moreover, IL-1 family members play a key role in the differentiation and function of polarized innate and adaptive lymphoid cells. Also it has reported that cytokines play an important role in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis (MS). Here we will focus on two of the key members of this family are the IL-18 and IL-36 in Iranian Relapsing Remitting Multiple Sclerosis patients(RRMS).</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> The purpose of the current study was to determine the serum levels IL-18, interleukin IL-36 and measure the frequency of rs360719 and rs1946518 SNPs on IL-18 gene in Iranian patients with RRMS compare to healthy control group.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> 105 Iranian patients that clinically definite as multiple sclerosis (RRM) and 113 healthy controls were enrolled. IL-18 gene SNPs was assessed by HRM-PCR method. Also In a case-control study, venous blood was collected from healthy subjects as control group (n=45) and MS patients (n=45). All selected patients were clinically diagnosed as having relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) .The plasma levels of the cytokines IL-36 and IL-18 were measured using ELISA method.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Elevated of IL-36 and IL-18 plasma level has been observed in patient with RRMS in comparison with control group. These findings also show that carriers of the (rs360719) and (rs1946518) display a slight protection against MS development. Patients homozygous for both SNPs showed a significantly higher proportion of MS patients.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> We found a highly significant increase of IL-18 and IL-36 plasma levels in MS patients in comparison with the control group. also These protective effects might be related to functional outcomes of these IL-18 variations. This investigate confirms that IL-18 and the gene may be contribute in MS development and its progression particularly.

The selected regions (1.9 Mb), either including the whole genomic segment (N=17 regions, 45 genes) or only the coding sequences (further 48 genes), were captured (Agilent SureSelect) and sequenced (GAIIx Illumina) in 576 Italian MS patients and 400 matched controls pooled in groups of 12 individuals.

Patients underwent clinical assessment using the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) and were classified as BMS if their EDSS score did not exceed 3, and non BMS (nBMS) otherwise. MRI scans were acquired at 3.0 T. Focal WM lesions were segmented using 3DFLAIR and kNN-TTP method. LEAP method was applied for lesion filling. FreeSurfer software (5.1) was used to measure global and regional cortical thickness (cTh) and deep GM (DGM) volumes from 3DT1. Fractional anisotropy (FA), mean, axial and radial diffusivity (MD, AD, RD) were obtained from diffusion tensor imaging and averaged across the WM skeleton obtained with FSL tract-based spatial statistics analysis.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> 60 HCs and 91 MS patients were recruited including 51 BMS and 40 nBMS. Mean age (50.3&#x000b1;7.1, 50.8&#x000b1;8.3, 54.1&#x000b1;8.1 years for HCs, BMS and nBMS), sex ratio, and mean DD (20.8&#x000b1;4.7, 23.6&#x000b1;4.8 years for BMS and nBMS) did not differ between groups. The median normalized WM lesion volume (NLV) was lower in BMS than in nBMS (p&#x0003c; 0.05 ). Mean whole-brain cTh was reduced in BMS (2.49&#x000b1;0.08 mm) and nBMS (2.44&#x000b1;0.10 mm) than HCs (2.56&#x000b1;0.09 mm) (p&#x0003c; 0.01 and p&#x0003c; 0.001). There was more cortical atrophy in nBMS than in BMS patients(p&#x0003c; 0.05) in particular in frontal (p&#x0003c; 0.05), precentral (p&#x0003c; 0.01) and postcentral (p&#x0003c; 0.05) areas. After adjustment for NLV, the mean whole-brain cTh did not differ between BMS and nBMS. Normalized DGM volume (NDGMV) was lower in BMS and nBMS than in HCs (p&#x0003c; 0.01 and p&#x0003c; 0.001). There was more subcortical atrophy in nBMS than in BMS (p&#x0003c; 0.05), even when controlling for WM lesions. Mean FA was significantly decreased and mean MD, AD and RD were significantly increased in nBMS compared to BMS and HCs, and in each MS group versus HCs. In stepwise logistic regression including age, sex, NLV, mean cTh, NDGMV, and FA, BMS was predicted by NDGMV (64.8% of cases correctly classified).

Nevertheless, understanding mechanisms underlying the cortical atrophy is still challenging.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> The aim of this study was to elucidate the relationship between focal and diffuse GM damage, by assessing how the appearance of new cortical lesions (CLs) affects the regional distribution and the longitudinal evolution of the cortical thinning.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Ninety-six patients were included in this 5-year longitudinal study. At baseline (T0), 20 patients had clinical isolated syndrome (CIS), 27 had early Relapsing Remitting MS (early RRMS) (disease duration &#x0003c; 5 years), 29 had late RRMS (disease duration &#x02265; 5 years) and 20 had secondary progressive MS (SPMS). Cortical thinning and new CLs were evaluated in more than 40 cortical areas by using Freesurfer and 3D DIR sequence both at T0 and after 5 years (T5).</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> New CLs mainly occurred in hippocampus (9.1%), insula (8.9%), cingulate cortex (8.3%), superior frontal gyrus (8.1%) and cerebellum (6.5%). Significant differences were observed among different disease subtypes (p&#x0003c; 0.001). Frontal regions were more involved in the early course of the disease, whereas during later stages the appearance of new CLs was more widespread. Similarly, the cortical thinning and volume loss distribution varied according to the disease duration. These were more severe in hippocampal gyrus, insula and cingulate cortex of CIS (7.7%, 6.2% and 7.0% respectively) and early RRMS (5.6%, 7.0% and 6.7% respectively), conversely they were significantly greater in precentral gyrus, postcentral gyrus, and cerebellum of late RRMS (-6.9%,-6.5% and -6.8%) and SPMS (-6.1%,-6.5% and -6.5 %). The total number of new CLs correlated with the global cortical thickness change in the whole group (r<sup>2</sup>=26.2, p&#x0003c; 0.001). However, such a correlation was more marked in CIS (r<sup>2</sup>=50.0, p&#x0003c; 0.001) and in early RRMS patients (r<sup>2</sup>=52.3, p&#x0003c; 0.001), moderate in late RRMS (r<sup>2</sup>=25.5, p&#x0003c; 0.001) and absent in SPMS (r<sup>2</sup>=6.3, p=0.133).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> In line with previous neuropathological studies on lymphoid-like meningeal immune cell infiltrates and subpial demyelination, some cortical regions seem to be more susceptible to both diffuse and focal damage than others. New CLs correlated with the development of cortical atrophy, at least in the early disease course, thus suggesting a potential relationship between focal and diffuse GM damage.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section875-1352458514546077"><title>P432</title><sec id="section876-1352458514546077"><title>The association of thoracic spinal cord gray matter atrophy with disability and disease type in multiple sclerosis</title><p><underline>R Schlaeger</underline><sup>1,2</sup>, ND Papinutto<sup>1</sup>, C Bevan<sup>1</sup>, E Caverzasi<sup>1</sup>, J Gelfand<sup>1</sup>, A Green<sup>1,3</sup>, KM Jordan<sup>1,4</sup>, W Stern<sup>1</sup>, H-C von B&#x000fc;dingen<sup>1</sup>, E Waubant<sup>1</sup>, A Zhu<sup>1</sup>, DS Goodin<sup>1</sup>, BA Cree<sup>1</sup>, SL Hauser<sup>1</sup>, RG Henry<sup>1,4,5</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>UCSF, Neurology, San Francisco, CA, United States, <sup>2</sup>University Hospital Basel, University of Basel, Neurology, Basel, Switzerland, <sup>3</sup>UCSF, Opthalmology, San Francisco, CA, United States, <sup>4</sup>Bioengineering Graduate Group, University of California San Francisco &#x00026; Berkeley, San Francisco &#x00026; Berkeley, CA, United States, <sup>5</sup>UCSF, Radiology and Biomedical Imaging, San Francisco, CA, United States</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> In multiple sclerosis (MS) cerebral gray matter (GM) atrophy correlates more strongly with disability than white matter (WM) atrophy.

A PSIR sequence was acquired at the T8/9 and in a subset of 115 patients also at the T9/10 inter-vertebral disc levels (dependent on available scanning time). Moreover, each subject received a brain MPRAGE, 1mm cubic voxels. Total cord and cord GM areas were segmented at each level, and cord WM areas were calculated as the difference between them. Correlations between the spinal cord areas and the Expanded Disability Status Score (EDSS) were assessed by Spearman rank correlation.

To explore the impact of NE changes on motor disability across subtypes of MS.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> 90 people with MS (18 subjects with primary progressive [PP] MS, 28 subjects with secondary progressive [SP] MS and 44 subjects with relapsing remitting [RR] MS) and 22 age-matched controls were included in this study. For each person we acquired diffusion imaging, magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) data and T1 volumetric sequences as well as metrics of upper limb disability (9 hole peg test), walking difficulties (timed walking test) and global disability (EDSS). Constrained spherical deconvolution tractography was used to create study-specific masks of motor system cortico-cortical, cortico-cerebellar and cortico-striatal fibres in controls. Fractional anisotropy, MTR and volume data were computed for each tract and combined to create a single, multi-modal metric of structural pathology. The combined metric thus obtained for each tract was then used to compute global and local NE for the motor network in each participant in the study.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> People with MS had a significantly lower global NE in the motor network compared to controls. The SPMS group presented with lower motor network global NE values compared to PPMS subjects, also when taking into account global disability, as well as lower global NE values compared to RRMS patients. Regression analysis identified local NE changes in the pre-frontal and basal ganglia nodes of the motor network as the more relevant anatomical substrata of motor disability.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The study findings indicate the potential of single-network global efficiency analysis to provide novel insights into the physiopathology of motor deficits in MS and to highlight phenotype-specific differences in discrete regions within a network.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section883-1352458514546077"><title>P436</title><sec id="section884-1352458514546077"><title>The link between subpial and diffuse white matter pathology in MS: a multimodal 7T and 3T MRI study using a surface-based and a tract-based analysis</title><p><underline>C Louapre</underline><sup>1,2</sup>, ST Govindarajan<sup>1</sup>, C Giann&#x000ec;<sup>1,2</sup>, J Cohen-Adad<sup>3</sup>, RP Kinkel<sup>4</sup>, C Mainero<sup>1,2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>AA Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging, Charlestown, MA, United States, <sup>2</sup>Harvard University, Boston, MA, United States, <sup>3</sup>Ecole Polytechnique de Montr&#x000e9;al, Montreal, QC, Canada, <sup>4</sup>Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA, United States</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Subpial and diffuse white matter (WM) injury are the pathological substrate of clinical progression in multiple sclerosis (MS).

We assessed the correlation between the MRI fingerprint of local damage severity and clinical motor and cognitive performances in MS patients.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> We enrolled 36 patients with early relapsing-remitting MS (34.8 years, 24 women/12 men, disease duration &#x0003c; 6 years) and 18 age-matched healthy controls who underwent advanced MRI examinations at 3T. Lesion count and segmentation were performed by certified neurologist and radiologist in 3D DIR, 3D FLAIR and 3D MP2RAGE images. Clinical examination were assessed using an extensive battery of cognitive, motor and disability tests. Lesions fingerprints were defined for both cortical and subcortical lesions by combining z-score measurements in 4 MRI modalities (z<sub>T1</sub>, z<sub>T2</sub>, z<sub>T2*</sub>, z<sub>MTR</sub>) between lesion and healthy tissue distribution in the corresponding ROI. Linear regression analysis was performed between lesions fingerprints and clinical scores for all patients.

The detection and quantification of dGM abnormalities is challenging in vivo, because of the limited size of these structures and the low contrast to surrounding tissues in conventional MRI.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> The aim of this work was to investigate dGM abnormalities on MRI images using texture analysis (TA), a novel approach that describes and quantifies the spatial distribution of intensity values in regions-of-interest. We aimed at relating texture to MS-related disability as measured by EDSS (Expanded Disability Status Scale).</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> 118 patients with relapsing-remitting MS were studied (80 women; age 44.9&#x000b1;10.4 y; disease duration 15.3&#x000b1;8.6 y; EDSS 2.7&#x000b1;1.4). T1-weighted MPRAGE and PD/T2-weighted images were acquired at 1.5T. Lesions were segmented semi-automatically. Cortical GM and dGM (i.e., thalamus, globus pallidus and striatum) were segmented using automated approaches (SIENAX and MAGeT). For each dGM structure, 139 features describing the texture (based on the histogram, gray level co-occurrence matrix, gradient, and run-length matrix) were extracted from T1w, normalized and reduced with principal component (PC) analysis using Matlab. Multiple linear regression was conducted to explore the relation between EDSS and the TA of dGM structures: in the first model, the explanatory variables (EVs) were the first <italic>k</italic> PCs that explained 95% of the variance of the original dataset; in the second model, the EVs were age, gender, disease duration, the most significant PCs derived from the previous model (p&#x0003c; 0.05), lesion volume, and GM volume. All statistical analyses were performed using R.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Using the most significant PCs of the thalamus, striatum and globus pallidus as EVs and EDSS as independent variable, R<sup>2</sup> values of 0.308, 0.161, 0.167, respectively, were found. R<sup>2</sup> reached 0.329 if a combination of all 3 dGM structures PCs was used. Adding age, gender, disease duration, lesion and GM volume to those PCs led to a R<sup>2</sup> of 0.352, 0.344, 0.321 and 0.371 for the thalamus, striatum, globus pallidus, and a combination of all 3.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our results confirm the involvement of dGM in the pathophysiology of MS.

In the 2 year, phase 3, FREEDOMS and FREEDOMS 2 studies, fingolimod 0.5 mg once daily significantly reduced BVL versus placebo. LONGTERMS is an open-label, single-arm, long-term follow-up extension study of phase 2, 3 and 3b trials of fingolimod in relapsing MS. It commenced in June 2010 and will continue, with annual interim analyses, until June 2016, providing the opportunity to study long- term effects of fingolimod on BVL.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To evaluate long-term BVL in patients who received fingolimod 0.5 mg or placebo in the FREEDOMS or FREEDOMS 2, core or extension studies, and later entered LONGTERMS.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> We performed a pooled analysis of patients who completed the FREEDOMS and FREEDOMS 2 core studies (full analysis set) and received at least one fingolimod dose in LONGTERMS.

The overall median (Q1-Q3) exposure to fingolimod was 915(271-1689) days (fingolimod 0.5 mg: 1271[699-2250]; placebo-fingolimod: 379[0-1486]); 18.8% of all patients had fingolimod exposure for &#x02265;2160 days (6 years). At M 6, 12, 24, 36, and 48, mean PBVC was -0.22 vs. -0.36; -0.44 vs. -0.63; -0.83 vs. -1.28; -1.22 vs. -1.73 and -1.61 vs. -2.16 for fingolimod 0.5 mg vs. placebo-fingolimod.

Detecting Fe positive (Fe+) m/M could thus provide an <italic>in vivo</italic> imaging biomarker to distinguish actively inflamed lesions from Fe negative (Fe-) chronic silent lesions. Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) from gradient echo MRI measures tissue magnetic susceptibility and is particularly sensitive to iron and myelin in white matter. Conventional T2 weighted (T2w) MRI is sensitive to the cellular content in a voxel of water. The combination of QSM and T2w would enable detection of iron in MS lesion.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To test the hypothesis that a Fe+ lesion can be detected by its volume increase from T2w to QSM using MRI and histological analysis (for Fe, myelin and m/M).</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> MRI: 7 formalin fixed MS brain specimens were imbedded in 1% agar. QSM (gradient echo) and T2w (fast spin echo) images were acquired on a 3T scanner using imaging parameters TR/TE spacing/#Echoes = 53.8ms/ 4.15ms/12 at a resolution of 0.7x0.7x0.7mm<sup>3</sup> for QSM and TE/TR = 83-103ms/1-2.5s at resolution 0.75x0.75x1.2 mm<sup>3</sup> for T2w. The volume of 12 lesions on MRI data were assessed. Histological sections: 4 lesions were examined with immunohistochemical labeling for myelin (MBP), m/M (CD68), ferritin and Perls stain; 2 of these had iron measurements using laser ablation inductively coupled mass spectrometry (LAICPMS).</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Four lesions with histology showed that volumes on QSM (Fe &#x000b1;): 6.9 (Fe-), 51.3 (Fe+), 138.0 (Fe+), and 303.5 (Fe+) mm<sup>3</sup> were larger than that on T2w: 6.6, 41.5, 100.3 and 245.4 mm<sup>3</sup> by 4.1%, 23.6%, 37.6% and 27.2% respectively. Fe&#x000b1; for lesions were determined by iron staining or LAICPMS measurements. While the Fe- lesion had no m/M on CD68, all Fe+ lesions had activated m/M at the lesion border on CD68. 0%, 76.9%, 23.1% and 91.2% of the QSM volumes of these lesions had paramagnetic susceptibilities, with their spatial extent from lesion periphery into interior consistent with that on histologic iron staining. All lesions showed near complete demyelination on MBP. Lesion spatial extents on T2w were consistent with that of demyelination on MBP. Twelve lesions were identified on T2w: 6 showed substantial volume increases (&#x0003e;10 mm<sup>3</sup>) from QSM to T2w and 6 showing no substantial volume difference (&#x0003c; 5 mm<sup>3</sup>).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our preliminary data suggests that a volume increase from T2w toQSM indicates iron presence in an MS lesion.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section893-1352458514546077"><title>P441</title><sec id="section894-1352458514546077"><title>Grey matter abnormalities in mesial temporal lobe characterize patients with multiple sclerosis and epilepsy</title><p><underline>M Calabrese</underline><sup>1</sup>, NS Orefice<sup>2</sup>, M Castellaro<sup>3</sup>, A Morra<sup>4</sup>, F Bortolon<sup>5</sup>, S Monaco<sup>1</sup>, P Manganotti<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>University Hospital of Verona, Dept. of Neurological and Movement Sciences, Verona, Italy, <sup>2</sup>University of Naples Federico II, Department of Pharmacology, Napoli, Italy, <sup>3</sup>University of Padova, Department of Information Engineering, Padova, Italy, <sup>4</sup>Euganea Medica, Neuroradiology Unit, Padova, Italy, <sup>5</sup>Multiple Sclerosis Centre, ULSS 6, Vicenza, Italy</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Epilepsy occurs more frequently in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) than in the general population and sometimes seizures may constitute the first manifestation of MS. Nevertheless the pathophysiology of epileptic seizures in MS remains a matter of debate, although in previous cross-sectional and longitudinal studies we observed that MS patients with epilepsy had a significant increase in number and volume of cortical lesions (CLs) compared to age- and sex-matched MS patients.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> Aim of our study is now to evaluate the regional distribution of both focal a diffuse grey matter abnormalities in a group of patients affected by MS and epilepsy.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Twenty one MS patients (MS/E) who presented, during the course of the disease, epileptic seizures that could not be explained by any other cause than MS, undergone a 1.5T MRI including a new 3D Double inversion recovery (DIR). Twenty-one MS patients age-, gender-,and disease duration-matched with MS/E were included as control group. Regional distribution of CLs and regional cortical thinning were evaluated.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> An accurate anamnesis revealed that 15 of 21 patients had simple partial seizures. Among these 15 patients, 9 reported symptoms that could be ascribed to temporal lobe epilepsy (such as deja vu, jamais vu or auditory, gustatory or olfactory abnormalities) and 8 patients had secondarily generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Two patients had complex partial seizures while the remaining 4 patients had primarily generalized tonic-clonic seizure (2 of which were nighttime). Imaging analysis revealed that MS/E had higher CL number and volume than MS (p&#x0003c; 0.001 for both comparisons). CLs were observed in the mesial temporal lobe (MTL) of 20/21 MS/E patients (95.2%) and in 5/21 MS (23.8%, p&#x0003c; 0.001). Among the 194 CLs identified in MS/E, 34 (17.5%) were located in the MTL whereas among the 98 CLs identified in MS, only 8 (8.2%, p=0.021) were located in the MTL. Beyond focal lesions, DIR also revealed some diffuse abnormalities in the MTL of these patients. Moreover significant reduction of the hippocampal and parahippocampal volume was observed together with a widespread cortical atrophy.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our results indicate that focal and diffuse grey matter damage of the MTL plays a major role in development of epileptic seizures in MS.

In practice, lesion load is often quantified by expert manual segmentation of MRI, which is time-consuming, costly, and associated with large inter- and intra- observer variability. Therefore automated lesion segmentation methods with accessible software implementations are necessary.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> We recently proposed two lesion segmentation methods, Subtraction-Based Logistic Inference for Modeling and Estimation (SuBLIME) and OASIS is Automated Statistical Inference for Segmentation (OASIS). SuBLIME is an automated method for segmenting incident lesion voxels between baseline and follow-up MRI studies. OASIS is an automated method for segmenting lesion voxels from a single MRI study. Both methods use carefully intensity-normalized T1-weighted (T1-w), T2-weighted (T2-w), fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) and proton density (PD) MRI volumes and are logistic regression models trained on manual lesion segmentations. Here we present software implementations of SuBLIME and OASIS, where users can upload MRI studies to a website to produce lesion segmentations within minutes.

MS NAWM demonstrates reduced myelin water fraction (MWF, an advanced MRI marker specific to myelin) compared to controls, however a prior study did not detect a change over 6 months.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> We performed a longer-term longitudinal assessment of MWF in NAWM and new lesions to determine the timescale of demyelination.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> 10 subjects with relapsing-remitting MS (age=33-58y, disease duration=1-30y, EDSS=1-4.5) and 3 controls (age=38-62y) were scanned on a 3T MRI at baseline and long-term follow up (LTFU, range 3-6y). Myelin water MRI was performed using a 32-echo T<sub>2</sub> relaxation acquisition (7 slices, TR=1200ms, TE=10ms, FOV=24cm, voxel=0.94x1.88x5mm). T<sub>2</sub> distributions were obtained by fitting the data to a multi-exponential decay model. Voxel-wise MWF was defined as the portion of the T<sub>2</sub> distribution from 10-40ms. NAWM masks, which excluded focal MS lesions, and masks of new lesions at baseline and LTFU were applied to MWF images. Mean, peak height and peak location were extracted from mask-based histograms of MWF.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> NAWM MWF histogram mean and peak height were significantly decreased at LTFU (mean = 0.095 vs 0.084, p=0.03; peak height = 0.104 vs 0.096, p=0.01). Control white matter showed no difference. MWF changes in new lesions were variable, with some increasing and some decreasing MWF at lesion first appearance and at LTFU.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> This study is the first to investigate long-term changes in MWF in relapsing-remitting MS over a period as long as 5 years. The decrease in MWF at LTFU indicates ongoing demyelination within NAWM. In acute lesions, patterns of demyelination and remyelination are expected, leading to different patterns of MWF changes. For the first time, MWF was used to detect tissue myelination changes over several years, demonstrating utility for monitoring therapeutic efficacy in longitudinal studies.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section899-1352458514546077"><title>P444</title><sec id="section900-1352458514546077"><title>Extended cortical lesion determining acute relapses in multiple sclerosis</title><p>M Puthenparampil<sup>1</sup>, D Poggiali<sup>1</sup>, P Perini<sup>1</sup>, F Rinaldi<sup>1</sup>, G Rolma<sup>1</sup>, F Causin<sup>1</sup>, <underline>P Gallo</underline><sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>University of Padova, Department of Neuroscience SNPSRR, Padova, Italy</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Cortical lesions can be observed at multiple sclerosis onset, increase in number and volume over the course of the disease and are thought to play a significant role in determining the progressive physical and cognitive deterioration observed in MS.

Our observations indicate that &#x02018;cortical relapses&#x02019; may occur in MS. Indeed, the symptoms observed in our patients had the clinical features of MS relapses: they had an acute presentation, lasted more than 24 ours, were explained by the magnetic resonance imaging findings and recovered after high-dose steroids. In all cases the vascular nature of the lesions was excluded. The routine magnetic resonance imaging investigation in MS should include sequences aimed at visualizing cortical lesions, such DIR or PSIR, especially in the presence of symptoms that suggest a cortical dysfunction. &#x02018;Cortical relapse&#x02019; has to be considered a new clinical aspect of MS.

This makes development of therapies for SPMS challenging. The conventional clinical (relapse frequency) and imaging end points (new T2-lesions and gadolinium-enhancing lesions) used in clinical trials of relapsing remitting (RR) MS are less applicable in SPMS trials. Hence new imaging biomarkers visualizing the SPMS-relevant pathology are greatly needed for treatment studies of progressive MS.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To evaluate, whether <italic>in vivo</italic> positron emission tomography (PET) imaging could be reliably used to obtain information about the underlying neuropathology in patients with SPMS.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Ten SPMS patients and eight controls were studied using the radioligand [11C]PK11195 binding to the 18-kDa translocator protein (TSPO) expressed on activated microglial cells. T1-hypointense lesions were classified as [11C]PK11195-positive, chronic active lesions if there was increased [11C]PK11195-DVR covering more than half of the lesion&#x02019;s circumference (in all axial slices) compared to the adjacent or contralateral NAWM. To evaluate the binding pattern of TSPO-ligands in more detail, autoradiography experiments using postmortem human MS brain tissue sections and TSPO radioligands were performed. In addition, immunohistochemical staining for CD68 was performed to visualize activated microglial cells in serial sections.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The DVR of [11C]PK11195 was significantly increased in the NAWM (p&#x0003c; 0.001) and thalamic ROIs (p=0.027) of SPMS patients compared to the control group. Increased perilesional TSPO-uptake was present in 57% of the chronic T1-lesions in MRI, giving thus <italic>in vivo</italic> proof of a significant proportion of chronic active lesions among SPMS patients. Autoradiography confirmed specific TSPO-ligand binding in the plaque edge, which was co-localized with activated, CD68-positive microglial cells/macrophages.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> PET imaging enables the detection of microglial activation in brains of SPMS patients <italic>in vivo</italic>, thus revealing the diffuse pathology and the presence of chronic active lesions more sensitively than conventional MRI imaging can do. This suggests that visualization of microglial activation with PET imaging could be used as an outcome measure in treatment trials of progressive MS.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section903-1352458514546077"><title>P446</title><sec id="section904-1352458514546077"><title>In vivo characterization of axonal damage in multiple sclerosis using high-gradient diffusion magnetic resonance imaging</title><p><underline>SY Huang</underline><sup>1,2</sup>, SM Tobyne<sup>3</sup>, A Nummenmaa<sup>2</sup>, T Witzel<sup>2</sup>, LL Wald<sup>2</sup>, JA Mcnab<sup>4</sup>, EC Klawiter<sup>3</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Massachusetts General Hospital, Department of Radiology, Boston, MA, United States, <sup>2</sup>Massachusetts General Hospital, Athinoula A.

Clinical characteristics of the MS subjects were as follows: median Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) 1.83 (range 1.0-3.0) and disease duration 7.3 &#x000b1; 4.8 years.</p><p>Sagittal 2-mm diffusion-weighted stimulated-echo echo planar images were acquired with 17 diffusion gradient increments (30-272 mT/m) and 5 diffusion times (11-96 ms) (b-values 400-10,000 s/mm<sup>2</sup>).

Thickness of retinal layers (optical coherence tomography), optic radiations (diffusion tensor imaging), visual cortex and whole brain gray and white matter volumes (structural MRI) were used to quantify atrophy. Linear regression analyses were used to assess associations between the different components and for comparing patients with and without optic neuritis and HC.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> In patients with MS, an episode of optic neuritis (MSON) was significantly associated with decreased integrity of the optic radiations (OR) and thinning of the peripapillary retinal nerve fibre layer (pRNFL) and macular ganglion cell complex (GCC). Lesion volume in the OR was negatively associated with pRNFL and GCC thickness in patients without optic neuritis (MSNON). The pRNFL and GCC showed associations with integrity of the OR, thickness of the primary visual cortex (only in patients with MSON), and also with global white and gray matter atrophy.

Resting-state functional connectivity patterns were examined using seed-based analyses via time-series correlations.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Cognitive impairment was documented in 5 of 19 patients. Compared to the control group, the MS group demonstrated higher functional connectivity between the posterior cingulate seed region and the following areas: anterior cingulate, left middle frontal gyrus, cerebellum and right insula and additionally between the thalamus seed region and anterior cingulate (all z&#x0003e;3.51, p&#x0003c; .001). Log-transformed T<sub>2</sub> lesion volume was negatively correlated with functional connectivity of the thalamus and right superior lateral occipital region (z=&#x02212;4.21, p=.0006).

Natalizumab is a relatively new treatment option that strongly suppresses inflammation in the brain, and has been shown to strongly reduce relapse rate and lesion formation. The strong clinical effect of natalizumab can only partly be explained by its effect on lesion formation, given the poor relationship between lesion load and physical disability. The clinical effect of natalizumab might rather be understood in terms of restraining more subtle damage in normal appearing WM as can be measured with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI).</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To investigate the effect of natalizumab treatment on the extent and severity of WM damage over time, compared to standard disease modifying drugs in relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS).</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> The study included 22 RRMS patients initiating natalizumab at baseline, 17 matched RRMS patients continuing interferon-beta or glatiramer acetate (IFNb/GA) and 12 matched healthy controls. DTI and conventional MRI sequences were obtained at baseline and month 12. Tract-Based-Spatial-Statistics (TBSS) was used at both time-points to compare diffusion measures between patients and controls, investigating the extent and severity of WM damage. Severity of fractional anisotropy (FA) abnormalities was expressed as a Z-score (compared to controls).

In IFNb/GA patients, 41.4% of the WM voxels at baseline was abnormal in terms of FA, which was 39.1% at month 12. The severity did not differ between patient groups at baseline (Z= &#x02212;0.67 for natalizumab patients and Z= &#x02212;0.64 for IFNb/GA patients, p=1.0). In natalizumab patients the FA-damage improved over time to Z= &#x02212;0.59 at month 12 (p=0.04). In IFNb/GA patients, severity of FA-damage remained stable over time, where it was Z=&#x02212;0.67 at month 12 (p=1.0).

The balance of local functional connectivity (LFC) and distant functional connectivity (DFC) throughout the brain is important for maintaining efficient network organization and performing cognitive tasks such as sustained attention. The temporal parietal junction (TPJ) is associated with effortful deployment of attention, a commonly observed cognitive deficit in multiple sclerosis (MS). Imaging biomarkers of LFC and DFC network integrity could aid in determining those at risk for cognitive impairment.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To explore the relationship between impaired attention and changes in LFC and DFC in relapsing-remitting (RR) MS compared to healthy controls (HC).</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Anatomical and RSFC data in 24 RRMS (mean disease duration 8.48 years; median EDSS=2.0, range 1-6.5) and 37 age- and gender-matched HC subjects were acquired at 3T. LFC and DFC maps were generated by summing suprathreshold (rho&#x0003e;0.3) voxels after correlating each voxel&#x02019;s timecouse to all other voxels inside (LFC) and outside (DFC) a 14mm spherical neighborhood. Normalized metrics were extracted from ventral attention (vATT), dorsal attention (dATT), and frontoparietal control (FPC) networks using a functionally defined network parcellation and compared to HC using a Student&#x02019;s t-test. Performance on the Symbol Digit Modality Test (SDMT), Paced Auditory Serial Addition Task (PASAT) and Brief Test of Attention (BTA) tests were correlated to RSFC metrics using a Pearson&#x02019;s correlation.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Performance on attention tests was impaired in the RRMS group, as compared to normative data (SDMT mean Z=&#x02212;0.228; 2s-PASAT mean Z=&#x02212;0.387; BTA mean Z=&#x02212;0.499). Average LFC was decreased in RRMS in areas representing the vATT (p=0.007) and dATT (p=0.036) networks. Average DFC was decreased in the vATT (p=0.002) and dATT (p&#x0003c; 0.001) and FPC (p=0.013) networks. Decreased DFC in posterior components of the vATT functional parcellation, corresponding to the TPJ, was significantly correlated with impaired performance on the 2-second delay PASAT (rho=0.602, p=0.005).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> LFC and DFC in RRMS were significantly reduced in the vATT/TPJ. Impaired performance on the 2-second PASAT positively correlated with decreased DFC within the vATT/TPJ, suggesting impaired performance on attention tasks is linked to the vATT network in MS. Decreased vATT/TPJ DFC may represent a promising biomarker for cognitive impairment in RRMS.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section917-1352458514546077"><title>P453</title><sec id="section918-1352458514546077"><title>The natural history of brain volume loss among patients with multiple sclerosis: a systematic literature review and meta-analysis</title><p><underline>T Vollmer</underline><sup>1</sup>, JE Signorovitch<sup>2</sup>, L Huynh<sup>2</sup>, P Galebach<sup>2</sup>, C Kelley<sup>2</sup>, J Marvel<sup>3</sup>, A Di Bernardo<sup>3</sup>, R Sasane<sup>3</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>University of Colorado School of Medicine, Department of Neurology, Aurora, CO, United States, <sup>2</sup>Analysis Group, Inc., Boston, MA, United States, <sup>3</sup>Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, East Hanover, NJ, United States</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Multiple sclerosis (MS) has been associated with progressive brain volume (BV) loss in multiple studies.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> We aimed to systematically summarize reported rates of BV loss in MS, to develop consensus estimates of the annual rate of BV loss in MS, to stratify by treatment, and to explore associations between BV loss and other markers of MS severity.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> A systematic literature search (2003-2013) was conducted to identify longitudinal studies of MS patients with at least 12 months of follow-up and reported changes in BV measures, including percentage BV change (PBVC), T1 lesion volume (T1LV), or T2LV. Patients receiving no treatment or receiving first-generation disease modifying treatment (DMT) with interferon-beta (IB) or glatiramer acetate (GA) were included.

In addition to enhanced MRI, each patient underwent MVMRS at the time of last NAB infusion, and at 4, 16, and 24 weeks. All studies were obtained at 1.5 T with 4-D technique. 4 slices included from the basal ganglia (BG) to above the ventricles. Metabolite peaks corresponding to Choline (Ch), Creatine (Cr), n-acetyl aspartate (NAA) and amino acids (AA) were measured and statistical analysis of corresponding ratios performed.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> At the time of final NAB infusion, the global sum of Ch/Cr plus NAA/Cr were significantly negatively correlated (r=&#x02212;0.43, p&#x0003c; 0.01) with the expanded disability status scale (EDSS). No significant differences were observed between baseline and 4 week spectra. By 16 weeks a reduction in the AA/Cr was observed only in the basal ganglia slice (0.224 vs 0.184, P=0.029). At submission only 17 of 30 patients have completed 24 weeks. In these, the reduction in the average AA/Cr ratio persists without further change. The BG Ch/Cr had increased (1.42 vs 1.56, p=0.0002).

Finally, to which extend longitudinal changes are correlated with clinical findings.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> A cohort of 60 untreated patients with a clinically isolated syndrome or early relapsing remitting MS (mean disease duration 3.2 years) with cranial high-resolution 3D T1-MPRAGE imaging at baseline and after an interval of 6 to 12 months was studied. Clinical testing comprised the expanded disability status scale, parts of the MS functional composite test, namely the 9 hole peg test (NHPT) and the 7.5 m walking test (T7.5) as well as the timed tandem walk. We deployed a region-of-interest (ROI) based volumetry using Statistical Parametric Mapping 12b. We quantified percentage volume changes (PVC) for BPV and various deep as well as cortical GM regions. PVC values were correlated with clinical parameters.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Regional atrophy measures, such as temporal lobe GM showed a more pronounced PVC than BPV, i.e. -1.75% (p&#x0003c; 0.0001) and -0.82% (p&#x0003c; 0.001), respectively. Taking intra-scanner variability into account, a significant PVC could be demonstrated for 10 out of 60 individual patients based on BPV as opposed to 16/60 individual patients based on the temporal lobe GM (5% error probability). Patients with significant PVC in the temporal lobe GM had poorer clinical outcomes for hand motor function (NHPT; p=0.001) and walking abilities (T7.5; p=0.001).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> ROI based GM volumetry is able to detect regional GM volume loss on short time scales in early MS patients on group but also on an individual patient level.

In both sequences we carried out axial reconstructions centred at C2-C3 level. Cross-sectional areas were evaluated using the spinal cord toolkit included in Jim 6.0 software. We studied two regions: first (SP1) from the odontoid down to C4 superior margin; and second (SP2), down to C7 superior margin. Neck coil was used to study both regions (SP1 and SP2), whereas head coil (HC) only for SP1. In these regions we measured global CSA spinal cord, i.e. spinal cord volume divided by cord length, and CSA measurements at C2-C3 and C3-C4 levels. Student t-test was applied to test for differences in CSA measurements using different coils. Mean squared error (MSE) was also calculated in order to measure the differences in CSA measurements along all the common length.

GM lesions relate better to cognitive and clinical disability than white matter (WM) lesions, and might even facilitate early diagnosis. Unfortunately, a large part of cortical GM lesions go undetected on conventional MRI using standard field strength due to their small size, scarcity of inflammation and partial volume effects from adjacent CSF and WM. In vivo studies suggested improved detection of cortical GM lesions by using high field 3T and ultra-high field 7T MRI systems. So far, however, histopathological verification of clinically applied MRI sequences has been lacking.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To determine the sensitivity of 3T and 7T MRI T1w, T2w, FLAIR, DIR and SWI sequences for the detection of GM lesions by directly comparing them to histopathology (gold standard).</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Coronal brain sections of 19 patients with MS (10 females) were obtained after rapid autopsy, formalin-fixed and scanned according to a multi-contrast MRI protocol on 3T and 7T Philips MRI systems. The scan protocol included T1w, T2w, FLAIR, DIR and SWI sequences. GM lesions were scored on all sequences separately by an experienced rater blinded to histopathology and clinical data. Staining was performed with antibodies against proteolipid protein (PLP) and scored by a pathological reader who was blinded to the MR and clinical data. Subsequently, MR images were matched to histopathology and sensitivity of MRI systems and sequences were statistically evaluated. Additionally, a second unblinded (retrospective) scoring of MR images was performed.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> In MS brain slices of 17 patients, we identified 99 lesions; 16 WM and 83 GM lesions (6 type I lesions, 27 type II lesions, 28 type III lesions and 22 type IV lesions). Overall, 7T MRI detected significantly (59%) more lesions than 3T MRI (Z=&#x02212;5.493, p &#x0003c; 0.001). Focusing on GM lesions only, 7T FLAIR detected 225% more lesions than 3T FLAIR (sensitivity 31 vs. 10%, Z=&#x02212;3.499, p &#x0003c; 0.001), 7T SWI detected 200% more lesions than 3T SWI (sensitivity 29 vs. 10%, Z=&#x02212;3.025, p = 0.002), and 7T T2w detected 107% more than 3T T2w (sensitivity 35 vs. 17%, Z=&#x02212;2,949, p = 0.003). Regarding WM lesion detection, no significant differences were found between 3T and 7T on all sequences.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Ultra-high field 7T MRI leads to an increased detection of GM lesions in MS, compared to 3T MRI.

These thalamic abnormalities are highly correlated with conversion to clinically definite MS, physical disability and cognitive impairment. Anatomically, the thalamus can be subdivided into a number of different thalamic nuclei, each with their own specific (sub) cortical output and input areas. This implies that damage to specific thalamic nuclei and/or their associated tracts should result in disparate symptoms.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To investigate groups of thalamic nuclei (anterior, posterior, medial, lateral) and the integrity of their associated tracts with regard to cognitive impairment and neuropsychiatric symptoms in MS patients.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Conventional MRI and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was acquired in 73 MS patients and 18 healthy controls (HC). The Minimal Assessment of Cognitive Function in MS (MACFIMS) was used to investigate cognitive functioning; neuropsychiatric symptoms were assessed using the Neuropsychiatric inventory. Based on a histological atlas, the thalamus was parcellated into an anterior, lateral, medial and posterior part. The associated tracts were derived using an atlas obtained by probabilistic tractography in the HCs and integrity of the tracts was expressed by fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD).</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> In MS patients, cognitive impairment, disinhibition and agitation were related to MD and lesion volume in tracts emanating from all four thalamic nuclei. No correlations were detected between FA and cognitive and neuropsychiatric measures in the posterior, medial and lateral thalamic tracts. However, FA was positively correlated with cognitive test scores and negatively with disinhibition, <italic>exclusively</italic> in the tract of the anterior part of the thalamus.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> FA changes in the anterior thalamic tract were the most specific marker for cognitive impairment and disinhibition. This finding provides a highly specific biological explanation for cognitive deterioration and neuropsychiatric changes common to MS.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section937-1352458514546077"><title>P463</title><sec id="section938-1352458514546077"><title>Multimodal quantitative magnetic resonance imaging of thalamus in multiple sclerosis and neuromyelitis optica</title><p>J Wang<sup>1</sup>, <underline>Y Liu</underline><sup>2,3</sup>, Y Duan<sup>2</sup>, H Dong<sup>2</sup>, J Ye<sup>2</sup>, F Barkhof<sup>3</sup>, K Li<sup>2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Hangzhou Normal University, Hangzhou, China, <sup>2</sup>Xuanwu Hospital, Beijing, China, <sup>3</sup>VU Medical Center, Amsterdam, Netherlands</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> The thalamus, a key node of the deep grey matter has been convergently found to show MS-related abnormalities, while thalamus implication in NMO patients were also reported with controversial results.

Six measurements were obtained for the whole thalamus for each participant including the gray matter volume (GMV), fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF), cross-correlation coefficient of spontaneous low-frequency (COSLOF) and weighted functional connectivity strength (wFCS). All of the measurements were compared among groups using multiple one-way analyses of covariance (ANCOVA). Correlations between MRI-based measures and clinical variables were investigated by multiple partial correlation analyses. At last we performed a receiver operating characteristic curve analysis to determine the power of the observed between-group differences to classify the groups.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Significant group effects were detected in the GMV and WM integrity (FA and MD) of the thalamus (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c; 10<sup>-3</sup>), while only MS patients showed decreased COSLOF and wFCS than HC, no significant functional parameters were found between NMO and HC. Significant correlation was identified between structural measurements, but not between structural and functional measurement in both MS and NMO. The observed differences in structural GMV and FA/MD of the whole thalamus exhibited fair-to-good-excellent discriminative power indistinguishing the three groups.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Structural and functional alterations in thalamus were identified in MS, while NMO showed similar pattern but much milder. The disassociation between structural and functional changes in both MS and NMO implies that structural and functional abnormalities in thalamus may occur independently and may provide complementary information about MS/NMO pathophysiology. The thalamic structural parameters showed fair-to-good-excellent discriminative power with very high specificity in three groups, which serves as potential MRI biomarkers to distinguish MS, NMO and HC.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section939-1352458514546077"><title>P464</title><sec id="section940-1352458514546077"><title>Memory impairment in multiple sclerosis: relevance of hippocampal activation and hippocampal connectivity</title><p><underline>HE Hulst</underline><sup>1</sup>, MM Schoonheim<sup>1</sup>, Q van Geest<sup>1</sup>, BMJ Uitdehaag<sup>2</sup>, F Barkhof<sup>3</sup>, JJG Geurts<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>VU University Medical Center, Anatomy and Neurosciences, Amsterdam, Netherlands, <sup>2</sup>VU University Medical Center, Neurology, Amsterdam, Netherlands, <sup>3</sup>VU University Medical Center, Radiology, Amsterdam, Netherlands</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Memory deficits develop in 40-65% of the patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) and generally lead to problems in daily life activities and to unemployment.

In MS, increased hippocampal connectivity was detected between the left hippocampus and the right posterior cingulate. Hippocampal activation during a memory task was decreased in cognitively impaired patients only; hippocampal activation in the entire patient group did not differ from HCs.

Applying the registration and segmentation processing to provide these measurements using the conventional MR images is very resource intensive; and the partial volume effect at the interface of these tissues makes it harder to extract accurately.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> Our goal was to perform a volumetric measurement of GM/WM using double inversion recovery (DIR) sequence. There is currently a &#x0201c;gap&#x0201d; between our academic ability to study atrophy and applying this concept in a routine clinical environment. The solution may lie in the use of this specialized MR pulse sequence that highlights either GM or WM alone. In this study, we tested the DIR sequence and a special processing methodology, to provide a simpler means by which to calculate the longitudinal measurement of GM/WM atrophy.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Inversion times for the DIR-sequence depend on the T<sub>1</sub> relaxation time of the tissue of interest to be suppressed. Using the theoretical values and an experimental approach, where five healthy participants were studied, the sequence parameters were optimized for GM-only DIR (GM-DIR): TI<sub>1</sub>/TI<sub>2</sub>=1400/500ms, and WM-only DIR (WM-DIR): TI<sub>1</sub>/TI<sub>2</sub>=2320/380ms, with B<sub>0</sub>=3T and the voxel resolution=1x1x1mm<sup>3</sup>. Masks generated from WM-DIR and GM-DIR are subtracted to discard the common fat layer and to ensure that the extraction is done efficiently.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> For GM-DIR, the measured mean contrast ratios for the tissue pairs are: i) GM and WM=0.88, ii) GM and CSF=0.81, and iii) GM and air=0.95. Similarly, for WM-DIR: i) WM and GM=0.87, ii) WM and CSF=0.85 and iii) WM and air=0.92. The brain GM and WM volumes &#x000b1; mean differences for volunteers were measured as (in mm<sup>3</sup>): GM = 558 &#x000b1; 28, WM = 373 &#x000b1; 35, whole brain = 915 &#x000b1; 40, similarly, for patients (in mm<sup>3</sup>): GM = 599 &#x000b1; 48, WM = 339 &#x000b1; 55, whole brain = 939 &#x000b1; 65.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Contrast ratio values of both GM-DIR and WM-DIR images are similar in their mean values. Relatively larger standard deviation is seen in the white matter for patients. This could indicate the variability in the demyelination across the given patient population. However not expected, the presence of overlapping pixels in the extracted masks may represent the myelinated grey matter regions, situated at the GM-WM interfaces, in the brain. In summary, DIR provides the potential for a complete assessment of total WM and GM volumes to follow patients over time.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section943-1352458514546077"><title>P466</title><sec id="section944-1352458514546077"><title>Brain sodium MRI in multiple sclerosis: a promising tool to monitor disability</title><p><underline>A Maarouf</underline><sup>1</sup>, A Faivre<sup>1</sup>, B Audoin<sup>1</sup>, A Rico<sup>1</sup>, E Soulier<sup>1</sup>, S Confort-Gouny<sup>1</sup>, M Guye<sup>1</sup>, L Schad<sup>2</sup>, J-P Ranjeva<sup>1</sup>, J Pelletier<sup>1</sup>, W Zaaraoui<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>CRMBM UMR 7339 CNRS Aix-Marseille Universite, Marseille, France, <sup>2</sup>Computer Assisted Clinical Medicine, Heidelberg University, Mannheim, Germany</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Brain sodium MRI is an emerging tool that enables depiction of cerebral sodium accumulation related to neuronal injury. In MS, demyelination, inflammation and subsequent mitochondrial energy failure result in axonal sodium accumulation, which leads to axonal calcium overload, causing structural and functional axonal injury that is the major substrate of disability in patients.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> This study aimed to assess sodium accumulation in patients at several stages of MS and the potential relationships between sodium concentration and their level of disability.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Forty-six MS patients including 14 early RRMS (median disease duration 1.2 years), 12 advanced RRMS (MDD 13 years), 20 progressive MS and 15 healthy controls were enrolled.

It has been related to disease outcomes more reliably than global or white matter volumes. Interest in grey matter has grown in the last years and newer software tools to measure grey matter pathology as glanced by MRI have been developed. FreeSurfer measures cortical thickness as well as subcortical volumes in 3D T1-weighted images. Unfortunately, most classical MS cohorts with long-term follow-up do not have 3D but 2D T1-weighted images.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> We aimed to evaluate if cortical thickness and subcortical volumes obtained with FreeSurfer software could be reliably measured in 2D T1-weighted images as compared to the same measures obtained with 3D T1 sequences.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Thirty-eight patients with MS and 2D and 3D T1-weighted images obtained at the same time were included in the analysis. FreeSurfer software was used to obtain cortical thickness and subcortical structures volumes in all 2D and 3D images. To assess reliability, the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) between these two measures was calculated. ICC measures were classified as: slight (0.01 to 0.20), fair (0.21 to 0.40), moderate (0.41 to 0.60), substantial (0.61 to 0.80), and almost perfect agreement (0.81 to 1.0). Two-tailed chi-square tests were used for group comparison.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Subcortical volumes showed good agreement between 2D and 3D images, with 53% of the structures having either a substantial or almost perfect agreement. The highest ICCs values included important structures for MS patients such as: thalamus, pallidum, caudate, brainstem, putamen, and corpus callosum. Cortical thickness had the lowest ICCs values, with 38.6% and 37.1% of the structures having a moderate or slight agreement respectively, and only 1 structure (right superior temporal gyrus) had a substantial agreement. Cortical thickness of lateral structures had higher proportions of moderate ICCs values than medial structures (58.3% vs. 13.3%, p=0.001).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Measuring subcortical volumes with FreeSurfer software in 2D images seems to produce reliable results.

After standard pre-processing, fMRI data were analysed through probabilistic Independent Component Analysis using FSL in order to separate artefacts from resting state networks. The Default Mode Network (DMN) component was used as guide to extract the principal eigenvariate from the prefrontal cortex (PFC), posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), left and right inferior parietal lobule (LIPL, RIPL). Seven different DCMs describing the effective connectivity between the DMN regions were chosen based on anatomical information or derived from literature. Parameters were estimated with SPM8 and the most likely model was selected using Bayesian Model Selection (BMS). Using this as reference, population networks were calculated for healthy, MS and each subgroup of MS patients using the posterior variance-weighted averaging method. Differences between the population connectivity parameters were tested calculating the z-scores of their differences.

Within four weeks before or after MRI, patients were clinically examined. Lesion burden was analysed with <italic>MRIcron</italic>, cortical thickness with <italic>Freesurfer</italic>. Multivariate linear regression analysis was used to analyse the association of T1, T2 and cortical lesion volume as well as cortical thickness and EDSS and the three MSFC components. Due to multiple testing, threshold was set as &#x003b1;=0.0125.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> T1 lesion volume was associated with the nine-hole peg test of the dominant hand (domNHPT; p=0.009) but not with EDSS (p=0.132), the timed 25-foot walk (T25-FW; p=0.157) and with the nine-hole peg test of the non-dominant hand (ndomNHPT; p=0.076). T2 lesion volume was associated with the domNHPT for trend (p=0.016), but not with T25-FW (p=0.238), ndomNHPT (p=0.061) and EDSS (p=0.097). Cortical thickness was associated with domNHPT (p=0.004), ndomNHPT (p=0.014 for trend), T25-FW (p=0.002) and EDSS (p=0.039 for trend). Cortical lesion volume was not associated with any of the clinical parameters. The paced auditory serial addition test (PASAT) result was not associated with any of the MRI parameters. In addition, explorative analyses suggested region-specific associations of cortical thickness and clinical parameters, whereas global cortical thickness was associated with age (p=0.001), but not disease duration (p=0.553).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> This study suggests that cortical thickness might be more relevant for clinical impairment in MS patients than the T1 or T2 lesion volumes. MSFC might be more suited for such analyses than EDSS. Such associations become clearer when compared with MSFC than with EDSS. This should be considered for the design of clinical studies and clinical practise.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section965-1352458514546077"><title>P477</title><sec id="section966-1352458514546077"><title>Tissue-specific brain volume changes on natalizumab: a 36-month follow-up study using VBM</title><p><underline>E Ciampi</underline><sup>1</sup>, D Pareto<sup>2</sup>, J Sastre-Garriga<sup>1</sup>, &#x000c0; Vidal-Jordana<sup>1</sup>, C Tur<sup>1</sup>, J R&#x000ed;o<sup>1</sup>, M Tintor&#x000e9;<sup>1</sup>, C Auger<sup>2</sup>, &#x000c1; Rovira<sup>2</sup>, X Montalban<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Vall Hebron University Hospital, Multiple Sclerosis Centre of Catalonia, Neuroimmunology Department, Barcelona, Spain, <sup>2</sup>Vall Hebron University Hospital, Magnetic Resonance Unit, Neuroradiology Department, Barcelona, Spain</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Global and regional GM loss occurs only during the first year of NTZ treatment in distinctive cortical and subcortical areas.

In this study, we marshaled long-term (up to 20 years) in vivo MRI data to study the evolution of chronic WML with proton density-weighted (PD) MRI.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To study the long-term evolution of individual white matter lesions (WML) in patients with MS using MRI.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> 5 progressive MS patients were studied. Data were acquired on several different scanners between 1994 and 2014, using a variety of protocols. All images underwent rigid registration to the average T1 scan in MNI space, resampling to 1x1x1 mm, and intensity normalization. 11 discrete WML (at least 2 lesions each) were identified and tracked over time using both manual and automatic methods. For automatic tracking, a pairwise subtraction-based method for detecting new and enlarging lesions was used.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> All analyzed WML were found to shrink consistently on longitudinal PD MRI, with no evidence for an inflection point. Over a mean duration of 15.2 years, the change in lesion volume was 50-61%, 32-54%, 79-88%, 39-98%, and 17-33% in the five patients. The estimation of lesion volume using manual and automatic methods did not differ (p=0.35). Lesions that were smaller at the first time point demonstrated the greatest relative change over time.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> In contrast to the pathological finding that ~40% WML are slowly expanding, we found no evidence of radiological enlargement of lesions in progressive MS, and noted a sustained contraction in lesion volume over time. Although pathological classification was not possible here, it is unlikely that all of the lesions were undergoing gradual remyelination and repair in these progressive MS cases. Instead, a more likely explanation for our findings is that the rate of enlargement of chronic lesions, if lesion expansion is indeed a real phenomenon, is slow relative to the rates of tissue resorption and atrophy at the lesion core. Further work will examine the clinical determinants and correlates of long-term changes in lesion size.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section969-1352458514546077"><title>P479</title><sec id="section970-1352458514546077"><title>MRI reveals connectivity of cortical lesions to deep white matter lesions in multiple sclerosis</title><p><underline>J-M Tillema</underline><sup>1</sup>, S Weigand<sup>2</sup>, J Port<sup>3</sup>, Y Shu<sup>3,4</sup>, J Mandrekar<sup>2</sup>, C Lucchinetti<sup>1</sup>, I Pirko<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Mayo Clinic, Neurology, Rochester, MN, United States, <sup>2</sup>Mayo Clinic, Biomedical Statistics and Informatics, Rochester, MN, United States, <sup>3</sup>Mayo Clinic, Radiology, Rochester, MN, United States, <sup>4</sup>Mayo Clinic, Biomedical Engineering and Medical Physics, Rochester, MN, United States</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> The relationship between cortical lesions (CL) and white matter lesions (WML) in MS is poorly understood. In addition to their association with disease progression, CL may also play a role in disease initiation. We hypothesized that WML-s develop along tracts directly connected with CL.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> Our aim was to demonstrate this connectivity using double inversion recovery (DIR) sequences for CL detection coupled with DTI-based probabilistic tractography.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Relapsing-remitting MS patients with relative mild disease (EDSS &#x0003c; =4) and matched controls were scanned using the same 3T MRI protocol (3D-MPRAGE, DTI (41 directions) and 3D-DIR). Freesurfer was used for segmentation of the cortex. Semi-automated outlining of WM and CL (on DIR) was performed. FSL was used for connectivity analysis. WMLs were used as individual seeds for tractography. Connectivity to the cortex for each individual tract was obtained. These connected cortical regions were combined, dividing the entire cortex into &#x0201c;WML connected&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;non-connected&#x0201d; cortex. We calculated the fraction of CL volume within the connected and non-connected cortex, quantified as the connected vs. non-connected lesion ratio (CNCLR). Automated cluster analysis was performed to include randomly selected, non-specific DIR cortical hyperintensities in patients and controls. For comparative analysis we placed topographically comparable WM seeds in each controls from matched patients via affine registration.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> 25 patients (median age 33) and 24 controls (median age 35) were included. Connected vs Non-connected lesion ratios were elevated in MS patients (median 2.7 [IQR 2.0-3.6]) compared to their nonspecific cortical areas (median 1.2 [IQR 1.0-1.5]; p&#x0003c; 0.001) and compared to nonspecific cortical areas in controls (median 1.0 [IQR 0.8-1.2]; p&#x0003c; 0.001). These non-specific cortical areas in MS patients had slightly higher CNCLRs than controls (p=0.10).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> CL on DIR are nearly 3 times as likely to be found in cortex that is connected to WML, providing evidence that CL and WML are topographically related. Non-specific DIR hyperintensities may be found slightly more frequently in connected cortex, suggesting that some of these non-specific regions may also represent poorly visualized CL due to sensitivity limitations. These findings are consistent with our hypothesis of CL-WML connectivity. Additional MRI and experimental pathology studies are underway to further investigate our hypothesis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section971-1352458514546077"><title>P480</title><sec id="section972-1352458514546077"><title>Can MS lesion stages be distinguished with MRI?

Pathologically, a distinction can be made between different stages of WM lesions; preactive, active, chronic active and chronic inactive, depending on their degree of microglia, inflammation and demyelination. Unfortunately, conventional MR Imaging cannot distinguish between lesion stages, so clinical correlates cannot be directly investigated. However, there are a few quantitative MR imaging (qMRI) techniques which have shown to be far more sensitive and pathologically specific.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To verify if different stages of WM lesion can be sufficiently differentiated by means of T1-RT in post mortem MS samples.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Coronal brain sections of 20 patients with MS (11 females) were obtained after rapid autopsy. The scan protocol included conventional Pd/T2 weighted images and six sets of images for T1 mapping (covering the same volume as the Pd/T2-w images). WM abnormalities visible on T2-w imaging were sampled and used for further examination. Staining and immunohistochemestry were performed on adjacent sections with antibodies against microglia/macrophages (anti-HLA-DR, clone LN3) and proteolipid protein (PLP). Sections containing WM lesions were matched to corresponding T2-w MR images. Lesions were outlined and copied onto T1 qMRI maps. For analysis between lesion types we used the unstructured General Estimated Equation (GEE) for correlated data.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> In total, 72 WM lesions were selected: 9 preactive, 18 active, 30 chronic active and 14 chronic inactive. Additionally, 38 areas of normal appearing WM (NAWM) were selected. Both NAWM and preactive lesions differed significantly from all other lesion types (p&#x0003c; 0.001), but did not differ significantly from each other (P=0.655). Active lesions differed significantly from chronic inactive lesions (p&#x0003c; 0.05), but not from chronic active lesions (p=0.147). Chronic active and chronic inactive lesions did not differ significantly from each other (p=0.155). However, when WM lesions were divided into three groups: &#x02018;NAWM/preactive&#x02019;, &#x02018;active&#x02019; and &#x02018;chronic&#x02019; (including chronic active and chronic inactive lesions), all groups differed significantly from each other (p&#x0003c; 0.05).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> We demonstrated that although not all four pathologically defined types of WM lesions can be sufficiently distinguished from each other, a MRI distinction can be made between NAWM/preactive, active and chronic lesions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section973-1352458514546077"><title>P481</title><sec id="section974-1352458514546077"><title>Corpus callosum atrophy is associated with cognitive impairment in multiple sclerosis: results of a 17-year longitudinal study</title><p><underline>T Granberg</underline><sup>1</sup>, J Martola<sup>1</sup>, G Bergendal<sup>2</sup>, S Shams<sup>1</sup>, P Aspelin<sup>1</sup>, S Fredrikson<sup>2</sup>, M Kristoffersen-Wiberg<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Karolinska Institutet, Department of Clinical Science, Intervention and Technology, Stockholm, Sweden, <sup>2</sup>Karolinska Institutet, Department of Clinical Neuroscience, Stockholm, Sweden</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Cognitive impairment is common in MS and may be subtle. The corpus callosum connects the cerebral hemispheres, is involved in connectivity-demanding cognitive tasks and is normally resistant to age-dependent change. However, due to its high myelin content it is affected in MS by lesions and Wallerian degeneration and may therefore serve as a sensitive and specific marker for cognitive function in MS.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To study corpus callosum area (CCA) as a marker and predictor of cognitive function and disability in multiple sclerosis (MS).</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> In this longitudinal study, 45 MS patients were followed clinically and with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) from 1995. Follow-ups were performed in 2004 (n=37) and 2013 (n=23). Mean follow-up time in 2013 was 17.2 years. A matched control group was recruited in 2013. Disability was assessed with expanded disability status scale (EDSS) and information processing speed with symbol digit modalities test (SDMT). CCA was measured on sagittal MRI. Volumetric measurements were obtained in Freesurfer.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Disease duration spanned over five decades (1.6-46) years and EDSS increased with disease duration. In neuropsychological testing, 82% of the patients performed subnormally. The annual corpus callosal atrophy rate was 6.6 mm<sup>2</sup> (1.2%), and decreased with increased disease duration. After correcting for disease duration, age, sex, and multiple testing, only grey matter volume was significantly correlated to EDSS. Brain volume and grey matter measurements were strongly correlated to SDMT. CCA, at all time points, showed strong to very strong correlations to the final SDMT score (<italic>r</italic>=0.682, <italic>p</italic>=0.003; <italic>r</italic>=0.838, <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c; 0.001 and <italic>r</italic>=0.855, <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c; 0.001 respectively).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Corpus callosal atrophy rate decreases with increasing disease duration. CCA outperforms volumetric measurements in correlation to current and future performance in complex information processing.

So far, few studies combined the two methods to detect damage underlying disability.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To investigate the effects of functional (FC) and structural (SC) connectivity abnormalities in determining clinical impairment in a MS population.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Thirty Relapsing-Remitting MS patients and 24 sex- and age-matched healthy subjects (HS) underwent a multimodal MRI using a 3T magnet. Resting state (RS) and DTI data were analysed by using MELODIC and Tract-Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS), respectively. A voxelwise General Linear Model was applied to assess group differences and clinical correlations (cluster-based threshold, family-wise-error corrected, p=/&#x0003c; 0.05). In all subjects we obtained measures of hand dexterity (9-hole peg test), ambulation function (25-foot test), cognitive performance (Paced Auditory Serial Addiction test ) and balance capability (stabilometry).</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Patients poorly performed in cognitive and balance exercises with respect to HS. Out of the 11 RS networks (RSNs) identified, 5 [cerebellum (CB), executive function (EF), dorsal attention (DA), basal ganglia (BG) and sensori-motor (SM)] showed lower FC in patients than in HS. No RSN showed increased FC in patients. Cognitive performance inversely correlated with FC in right fronto-parietal (rFP), EF and DA networks and directly correlated with FC in the CB, temporal, BG and SM networks. Balance capability inversely correlated with FC in the rFP and visual networks. DTI parameters were altered in patients with respect to HS in most of white matter tracts, where a direct correlation was found with cognitive performance and hand dexterity. Moreover, reduced SC in the corpus callosum was related to higher FC in the temporal and CB networks.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> In MS, both FC and SC abnormalities were detected and were found to correlate with different clinical domains. Only the cognitive impairment was related with both structural damage and FC changes. A better cognitive performance was associated with higher FC in 4 RSNs: FC in two of them (CB and temporal) was inversely related to corpus callosum damage. Despite the complex relationship between FC and SC, our data suggest an attempt of higher FC to compensate structural damage and to limit clinical impairment.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section977-1352458514546077"><title>P483</title><sec id="section978-1352458514546077"><title>Longitudinal DMN changes in cognitively preserved MS patients</title><p><underline>R Docimo</underline><sup>1,2</sup>, A Bisecco<sup>1,2</sup>, F Esposito<sup>2,3</sup>, G Muzzo<sup>1,2</sup>, G Pontillo<sup>1,2</sup>, S Bonavita<sup>1,2</sup>, L Lavorgna<sup>1,2</sup>, M Cirillo<sup>1,2</sup>, G Tedeschi<sup>1,2</sup>, A Gallo<sup>1,2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Second University of Naples, Department of Medical, Surgical, Neurological, Metabolic and Aging Sciences, Naples, Italy, <sup>2</sup>MRI Research Centre SUN-FISM - Neurological Institute for Diagnosis and Care &#x02018;Hermitage Capodimonte&#x02019;, Naples, Italy, <sup>3</sup>University of Salerno, Department of Medicine and Surgery, Salerno, Italy</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Resting-state networks (RSNs) explored by functional MRI (fMRI) during resting conditions allow to assess cortical reorganization in MS.

The core MRI protocol included 3D fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) and 3D T2*-weighted gradient echo. In addition a 3D T2*-weighted gradient echo with high-EPI (echo planar imaging) factor was acquired on the Philips. WM intralesional veins were identified on all T2* imaging. WM lesion numbers were counted using FLAIR and T2* sequences.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Eight patients with relapsing remitting MS and 3 with WM ischemic lesions have been included so far. Intralesional veins could be identified in more MS than ischemic lesions, no matter which scanner was used.

Mean numbers of intralesional veins in the ischemic group were virtually the same irrespective of scanner or sequence used (mean =0.9).</p><p>Intralesional vein numbers in the MS group differed between scanners despite the same core gradient echo sequence being used. The mean number identified using scanner A, standard T2* was 15.3 (range 2-36) vs 5.5 (range 0-11) using scanner B. T2* with EPI factor allowed the most number of veins to be identified (mean 45.6, range 5-101) compared to the standard T2* gradient echo on the same scanner. WM lesion numbers differed between scanners. The mean lesion number in the MS group on scanner A, standard T2* being 49.7 vs 14 using scanner B. T2* with EPI factor allowed higher lesion counts (mean 71.2). FLAIR allowed the highest lesion counts but numbers differed between scanners (78.7 vs 46.6, MS group).

However accrual of disability in MS is predominantly due to a progressive neurodegenerative process, whereas in NMO it appears solely relapse related. Prospective imaging studies are needed to assess if there is any evidence of progressive, non-lesional neurodegeneration outside of relapses in NMO as occurs in MS.

While increased recruitment of regions of the temporo-occipital lobes contributes to better performance at these tasks, engagement of parietal lobe regions (related to tissue loss) is associated to poor cognitive outcome.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section987-1352458514546077"><title>P488</title><sec id="section988-1352458514546077"><title>Brain atrophy quantification in multiple sclerosis</title><p><underline>S Jain</underline><sup>1</sup>, D Smeets<sup>1</sup>, DM Sima<sup>1</sup>, A Ribbens<sup>1</sup>, K Janssens<sup>1</sup>, M Daams<sup>2</sup>, M Steenwijk<sup>2</sup>, H Vrenken<sup>2</sup>, F Barkhof<sup>2</sup>, W Van Hecke<sup>1,3</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>icoMetrix, Leuven, Belgium, <sup>2</sup>VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, Netherlands, <sup>3</sup>Antwerp University Hospital, Antwerp, Belgium</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the brain has become a standard radiological tool for examining multiple sclerosis patients. Apart from the presence and location of lesions, grey matter atrophy is an important indicator for the diagnosis and prognosis of cognitive impairment. Current brain segmentation methods such as SIENAX provide volumetric measures for white matter (WM), grey matter (GM) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), but are inaccurate when applied to MS patients, due to the presence of lesions. In these cases the GM volume is typically overestimated, and thus the GM atrophy is underestimated.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> We propose an automatic method for quantifying brain volumes in MS patients by compensating for the presence of lesions.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> 3D T1-weighted and FLAIR MR images are used simultaneously in a probabilistic model to segment the brain tissue into grey matter, white matter and cerebrospinal fluid using expectation-maximization, allowing for an outlier class in order to accommodate the lesions. Subsequently, the T1-weighted images are used for lesion filling, which means that pixels labeled as lesion are replaced by artificially generated intensities using the statistical distribution of neighbouring WM pixels. Brain segmentation is performed again only with the WM, GM and CSF classes.</p><p>20 multiple sclerosis patients participated in a study at VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, the Netherlands. They were scanned on a 3T whole body scanner (GE Signa HDxt, Milwaukee, WI, USA). Expert lesion identification and manual segmentation was performed based on the FLAIR images by a highly trained neuroradiological team.</p><p>WM, GM and CSF percentages within the expert-segmented lesions are compared between the segmentation of the 3D T1-weighted images before and after lesion filling using unpaired t-tests.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Before lesion filling, we found a very low percentage of WM (9 &#x000b1; 10%) within lesions, because a high percentage of lesion volume was attributed to GM (65 &#x000b1; 17%) and CSF (26 &#x000b1; 17%). After lesion filling, WM percentage within lesions became very high (77 &#x000b1; 7%), followed by GM (20 &#x000b1; 6%) and CSF (3 &#x000b1; 3%). These volume differences before and after lesion filling are highly significant (p&#x0003c; 0.0001).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> We propose a fully automatic method to quantify WM, GM and CSF volumes in MR images of MS patients. The method compensates for the presence of lesions and substantially reduces the underestimation of GM atrophy.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section989-1352458514546077"><title>P489</title><sec id="section990-1352458514546077"><title>Sample-size calculations for short-term proof-of-concept studies of tissue protection and repair in MS lesions via conventional clinical imaging</title><p><underline>DS Reich</underline><sup>1</sup>, R White<sup>2</sup>, ICM Cortese<sup>1</sup>, L Vuolo<sup>1,3</sup>, CD Shea<sup>1</sup>, TL Collins<sup>4</sup>, AJ Petkau<sup>2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, NIH, Bethesda, MD, United States, <sup>2</sup>University of British Columbia, Statistics, Vancouver, BC, Canada, <sup>3</sup>University of Florence, Neurology and Radiology, Florence, Italy, <sup>4</sup>Myelin Repair Foundation, Saratoga, CA, United States</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> New lesion activity on MRI is used to test immunomodulatory therapies in MS proof-of-concept trials, but comparably powerful endpoints to assess tissue protection or repair are lacking.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To report sample-size calculations for assessment of new lesion recovery in highly active MS.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> In 6 active MS cases, new lesions were observed by monthly 3 tesla (T) MRI for &#x02265;12 months. Similar data were obtained from a historical set of 6 active MS cases observed by monthly 1.5T MRI for a similar time period. Averages and quartiles of normalized (proton density/T1/T2 weighted) and quantitative (T1/T2 maps and mean diffusivity in the 3T dataset, T2 maps and magnetization transfer ratio in the 1.5T dataset) measures were used to compare the lesion area before lesion appearance to afterward. A linear mixed effects model incorporating lesion- and participant-specific random effects estimated average levels and variance components for sample-size simulations.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> In both datasets, the greatest statistical sensitivity was observed for the 25<sup>th</sup> percentile of lesion-by-lesion normalized proton density-weighted signal. Based on the 3T dataset, using new lesions &#x02265;15 mm<sup>3</sup>, 9 participants/arm are required for a 6-month, placebo-controlled, add-on trial postulating a therapeutic effect size of 20% and statistical power of 90%. For the same effect size and power, when considering all incident lesions in a 12-month trial, the 3T and 1.5T datasets yielded similar results, with sample sizes of 8 to 10 participants/arm. In general, normalized measures derived from conventional imaging performed far better than quantitative measures, including those derived from relaxation mapping, diffusion imaging, and magnetization transfer.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Lesion recovery is a powerful outcome measure for proof-of-concept clinical trials of tissue protection and repair in MS. Such trials require active cases and are therefore best implemented near disease onset. The extent to which success in this type of trial will predict efficacy in trials of progressive MS remains to be demonstrated.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section991-1352458514546077"><title>P490</title><sec id="section992-1352458514546077"><title>The value of MRS, a novel MRI technique, as a predictor of disability: analysis at 20-years of RRMS patients treated long-term with glatiramer acetate</title><p><underline>O Khan</underline><sup>1,2</sup>, F Bao<sup>2</sup>, C Ford<sup>3</sup>, S Kolodny<sup>4</sup>, A Vainstein<sup>5</sup>, Y Sidi<sup>5</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Multiple Sclerosis Center, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, MI, United States, <sup>2</sup>Sastry Foundation Advanced Imaging Laboratory, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, MI, United States, <sup>3</sup>University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center, Albuquerque, NM, United States, <sup>4</sup>Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, Cleveland, OH, United States, <sup>5</sup>Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, Netanya, Israel</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Finding MRI metrics and techniques to serve as validated surrogate markers for disability in MS patients (pts) has been a research priority for decades.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To explore potential correlations between various MRI measurements and disability in RRMS pts receiving long-term (~20 years) treatment with glatiramer acetate (GA).</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> At approximately 20 years from the initiation of the US Glatiramer Acetate open-label long-term extension study (GA 9004), pts continuing in the trial in November, 2012, were invited to undergo MRI assessment (the first MRI examination in this study). MRI data and clinical data reported at the time closest to the MRI scan date were evaluated for correlations between the two disease outcomes. The Elastic Net model selection algorithm using a criterion of minimum mean square error (MSE) was applied to select variables that contribute to the odds at the 20-year follow-up of a pt belonging to either the higher or lower disability subgroup, defined by EDSS score of &#x02265; 2 steps vs EDSS &#x0003c; 2, pyramidal functional system score (FSS) &#x02265; 2 vs &#x0003c; 2, and pyramidal FSS &#x02265; 3 vs &#x0003c; 3. The following MRI variables, whole brain (WB), grey matter (GM), and white matter (WM) volumes; total N-acetylaspartate/total creatine (<italic>t</italic>NAA/<italic>t</italic>Cr) ratio on MRS; T1 and T2 lesions volumes; along with gender, disease duration, exposure to GA, and age at MRI scan, were added as candidates for selection. In cases when variables with high correlations (correlation coefficient &#x02265; 0.7) were selected, a model with next smallest MSE that eliminated 1 of these variables was chosen. In the final selection model, the relative contribution of each selected variable to the predicted odds was calculated.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Of 64 pts who underwent MRI after 20 years on-study, 39 (61%) were included in the MRS assessment. The selection methodology showed MRS was the most influential parameter (98%, 97%, 81%) for predicting the odds of belonging to a specific disability subgroup using the cutoffs EDSS &#x02265; 2 vs &#x0003c; 2, pyramidal FSS &#x02265; 2 vs &#x0003c; 2, and pyramidal FSS &#x02265; 3 vs &#x0003c; 3, respectively. An increase of 1 point in tNAA/<italic>t</italic>Cr level decreased the odds of being in the higher disability subgroup for each parameter by 74%, 91%, and 98% for EDSS &#x02265; 2, pyramidal FSS &#x02265; 2 and pyramidal FSS &#x02265; 3, respectively (odds ratios: 0.26, 0.09, and 0.02, respectively).
