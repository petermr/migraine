The efficacy of NTZ is related to its profound effect on reducing lymphocyte trafficking into the CNS. However, its effect on tissue injury in the CNS and axonal metabolic function is not well understood.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To determine the effect of natalizumab (NTZ) on brain tissue injury and cervical cord volume in a multi-modal advanced MRI study.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> A four-year, prospective, open-label study was conducted in RRMS patients initiating therapy with NTZ, who were previously na&#x000ef;ve to NTZ therapy. Multi-modal advanced brain MRI including 3D-T1W, DTI, MTR, multi-voxel <sup>1</sup>H-MRS, and cervical cord MRI were obtained at baseline and annually thereafter. Focal pathology in the brain was also tracked longitudinally by following 3 to 5 lesions per brain. Age-matched healthy controls (HC) were also imaged annually. We are presenting the two-year interim analysis of this ongoing four-year study.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Twenty-five patients with RRMS initiating therapy with NTZ participated. At year 2 mean <italic>t</italic>NAA/<italic>t</italic>Cr improved from 1.98 to 2.10 (p=0.003). Compared to baseline and HC, there was no significant loss of cortical surface volume or thalamic volume at year 2. Focal T2 lesion pathology followed longitudinally (102 non-enhancing lesions) showed mean MTR improve from 44.37% to 46.16% (p=0.0006); mean FA from 0.247 to 0.290 (p=0.001); voxel-wise MTR showed 88.4% of the lesions to be stable over 2 years. T2 lesion volume and T1 lesion volume were significantly reduced. Brain volume change (PBVC) was -0.81% from baseline to year 1 and -0.53% from year 1 to year 2. Cervical cord cross-sectional area (CSA) measured at C2 level changed from 75.76 mm<sup>2</sup> to 74.45 mm<sup>2</sup> (p=0.16). There was no significant different when comparing the net change in HC.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> This study demonstrates the effect of NTZ on preserving axonal metabolic function, as well as improving focal pathology indicated by improving MTR and FA. There was no significant loss of thalamic or cortical surface volume, when comparing to HC. These results indicate that besides a profound effect of NTZ at the blood-brain barrier level, there may be additional effects on tissue injury and axonal metabolic function in the CNS. Further longitudinal follow-up with annual MRI scans is ongoing to investigate the anti-inflammatory and potential neuroprotective effects of NTZ in the CNS.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section4-1352458514547846"><title>P492</title><sec id="section5-1352458514547846"><title>Corpus callosal myelin water fraction and transcallosal inhibition in multiple sclerosis</title><p><underline>IM Vavasour</underline><sup>1</sup>, EY Zhao<sup>2</sup>, MR Borich<sup>3</sup>, A Rauscher<sup>1</sup>, C Laule<sup>1,4</sup>, AL Traboulsee<sup>5</sup>, DKB Li<sup>1</sup>, LA Boyd<sup>6</sup>, AL Mackay<sup>1,7</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>University of British Columbia, Radiology, Vancouver, BC, Canada, <sup>2</sup>University of British Columbia, MD/PhD Program, Vancouver, BC, Canada, <sup>3</sup>Emory University, Rehabilitation Medicine, Atlanta, GA, United States, <sup>4</sup>University of British Columbia, Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Vancouver, BC, Canada, <sup>5</sup>University of British Columbia, Medicine, Vancouver, BC, Canada, <sup>6</sup>University of British Columbia, Physical Therapy, Vancouver, BC, Canada, <sup>7</sup>University of British Columbia, Physics and Astronomy, Vancouver, BC, Canada</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques assessing T<sub>2</sub> relaxation can measure myelin water fraction (MWF), a marker for central nervous system demyelination in multiple sclerosis (MS). Transcallosal inhibition (TCI), elicited by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), reflects functional integrity of fibres in the corpus callosum (CC).</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To characterize the relationship between MWF in the CC and TCI assessed by TMS-evoked potentials in MS subjects on glatiramer acetate. This relationship may guide the use of MWF for evaluating therapies that induce remyelination or have neuroprotective effects, and improve the design of clinical trials for more efficient development of new treatments.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Twenty-six relapsing-remitting MS patients (5M/21F, mean age 42.3: range 28-59y, EDSS range 1.0-6.0, disease duration range 1-35y) and 10 controls (2M/8F, mean age 43.4y) underwent both MRI and TMS testing. The MRI protocol included a 32 echo T<sub>2</sub> relaxation GRASE sequence (TR=1000 ms, 10 ms echo spacing, 20-5 mm slices). The T<sub>2</sub> signal was modelled via multiple exponential components and the MWF was computed as the ratio of the short T<sub>2</sub> component to the total area. The CC was segmented anteroposteriorly into five regions and mean MWF was calculated for each. TMS was performed using a figure-of-eight coil delivering focal stimulation over the primary motor cortex representation of the forearm extensor musculature. Single pulses were delivered ipsilaterally to elicit a transient suppression in the electromyographic activity of the forearm during a voluntary isometric grip contraction (50% max). The onset latency, duration and depth of this suppression were used to quantify levels of TCI.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> TCI duration was significantly longer in MS subjects (36.0 &#x000b1; 5.2 ms) than in controls (25.6 &#x000b1; 8.2 ms, p = 0.016). MWF was 35% higher in the posterior than in the anterior CC (p&#x0003c; 0.0001). Median MWF was lower in MS subjects in all five regions, though without statistical significance. In MS subjects, the log transformed TCI depth was negatively correlated with the MWF of the posterior CC midbody (r = &#x02212;0.73, p = 0.039), a region previously shown to be critical in TCI transmission.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The relationship between MWF in the CC and TCI assessed by TMS-evoked potentials in MS subjects improve understanding of the structure and function of myelin in MS. MWF and TMS measures may provide biomarkers of demyelination and disease progression.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section6-1352458514547846"><title>P493</title><sec id="section7-1352458514547846"><title>White matter and long-tract lesions play a marginal role in determining cortical atrophy</title><p>D Seppi<sup>1</sup>, S Miante<sup>1</sup>, V Poretto<sup>1</sup>, D Poggiali<sup>1</sup>, F Rinaldi<sup>1</sup>, P Perini<sup>1</sup>, <underline>P Gallo</underline><sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>University of Padova, Department of Neuroscience SNPSRR, Padova, Italy</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> To what extent retrograde axonal degeneration induces cortical atrophy in white matter diseases is still debated. Neuroimaging studies of the sensory-motor cortex in patients with severe tract pathology, such as traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) and neuromyelitis optica (NMO) with extensive spinal cord lesions, gave conflicting results.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To analyse cortical atrophy in patients with severe lesions of the sensory-motor tracts (SCI and NMO), inflammatory tumour-like lesions (TLL) and relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) with or without spinal cord lesions.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Fifteen patients with severe SCI (mean follow-up period: 5.8 years), 10 patients affected from NMO with extensive inflammatory spinal cord lesions (mean disease duration: 6.2 years), 5 patients with TLL and 30 patients with MS (15 with and 15 without spinal cord lesions) were included in the study. MRI examination included T2, 3D T1, FLAIR, double inversion recovery (DIR) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) sequences. Cortical atrophy was analysed by Freesurfer.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> A significant thinning of sensory-motor cortex, unrelated to subcortical T2 lesion load and the presence of spinal cord lesions, was observed in RRMS (p&#x0003c; 0.001), while it was modest in SCI (p ranging from 0.08 to &#x0003c; 0.01) and NMO (p ranging from 0.04 to 0.02). Global and regional cortical thickness was significantly decreased in RRMS compared to both NMO and SCI (p&#x0003c; 0.001 for all comparisons). In TLL, cortical atrophy was modest in the cortex over the lesions compared to that of the contralateral hemisphere (p=0.02). Fractional anisotropy was significantly decreased in the cortex of RRMS while it was normal in SCI, NMO, and TTL.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Whether cortical atrophy in MS is the results of retrograde axonal degeneration or is mainly related to a direct (local) damage is still debated. We found that severe long-trait damage induces only a modest cortical thinning in the sensory-motor cortex, while in RRMS cortical atrophy was relevant even in patients without spinal cord lesions and with low T2 lesion load. Thus, retrograde degeneration of axons seems to plays only a marginal role in determining cortical thinning in MS. A role for a local pathological process, determining neuron loss and cortical atrophy, is also supported by the finding that FA of the cortex was normal in SCI, NMO and TLL, and significantly decreased in RRMS.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section8-1352458514547846"><title>P494</title><sec id="section9-1352458514547846"><title>Characteristic of orbit magnetic resonance imaging in neuromyelitis optica and multiple sclerosis patients presenting with optic neuritis</title><p><underline>Y-M Lim</underline><sup>1</sup>, KM An<sup>1</sup>, J Lee<sup>1</sup>, SY Pyun<sup>2</sup>, K-K Kim<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Asan Medical Cente, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Neurology, Seoul, Korea, Republic of, <sup>2</sup>National Police Hospital, Neurology, Seoul, Korea, Republic of</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Patients with neuromyelitis optica (NMO) and multiple sclerosis (MS) both can present with optic neuritis (ON). There have been several reports on neuroimaging findings of ON in NMO and MS, but the results have been contradictory. Previous studies reported patients with chiasmal involvement developed clinically definite MS, whereas recent studies suggested there was a trend toward more posterior location within the anterior visual pathways in NMO-associated ON.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> We aimed to determine whether there were magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) characteristics of the anterior visual pathways in acute ON to distinguish NMO/NMO spectrum disorders (NMOSD) from MS.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> We included 26 NMO/NMOSD patients (34 affected eyes) and 48 MS patients (71 affected eyes) who presented with ON. The NMO/NMOSD patients fulfilled the revised diagnostic criteria and showed seropositivity for NMO-IgG. MS patients met 2010 McDonald diagnostic criteria. We analyzed orbit MRIs obtained within 60 days of ON onset. The MRI parameters assessed were as follows: extent and location of affected optic pathway (retrobulbar, canalicular, intracranial, optic chiasm, and optic tract), severity of optic nerve swelling and enhancement, and presence of involvement of adjacent brain structures such as hypothalamus.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The female percentage was 84.6% in the NMO/NMOSD group and 79% in the MS group. The mean age (SD) was 36 years (13.6) and 39 years (13.9) in NMO/NMOSD patients and MS patients, respectively. The number of patients with chiasmal involvement was significantly higher in the NMO/NMOSD group (n=8, 20.0%) than in the MS group (n=3, 3.8%) (p=0.006). The optic tract was more frequently affected in NMO/NMOSD patients (n=4, 10.0%) than in MS patients (n=1, 1.3%) (p=0.042). NMO-associated ON have more extensive lesion beyond the three segments of optic pathway. Hypothalamic involvement was exclusively seen in NMO-associated ON (n=3, p=0.035). There were no significant differences in the severity of swelling and enhancement.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Based on our results, NMO/NMOSD-associated ON shows more extensive lesions than MS-associated ON and involves more posterior parts within the anterior visual pathways. Concurrent involvement of hypothalamus is a unique feature in NMO/NMOSD-associated ON. These findings may be related to the distribution of sites of high AQP4 expression and help to distinguish ON in NMO/NMOSD from MS.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section10-1352458514547846"><title>P495</title><sec id="section11-1352458514547846"><title>High field spinal cord imaging in multiple sclerosis at 7 Tesla</title><p><underline>S Pawate</underline><sup>1</sup>, A Dula<sup>2</sup>, B Robert<sup>2</sup>, D Richard<sup>2</sup>, S Sriram<sup>1</sup>, J Gore<sup>2</sup>, S Smith<sup>2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Neurology, Nashville, TN, United States, <sup>2</sup>Vanderbilt University Institute of Imaging Scienes, Nashville, TN, United States</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Spinal cord is a major site of involvement in progressive MS. Imaging of the spinal cord is challenging due to its small size and location in a bony canal. Conventional MRI does not detect the diffuse damage occurring in grey matter and normal appearing white matter.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> Our purpose is to evaluate the sensitivity of 7T to detect SC lesions in MS patients compared to lower field (3T), clinically standard MRI evaluation. We also show the improvement in gray (GM) and white matter (WM) visibility allows for a discrimination of GM lesions, which are known to exist from histopathological studies, but have not been shown at 3T.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> MR scans were performed at 7T (Philips Healthcare) with a novel 16-channel cervical spinal cord receive coil. High resolution T1- and T2*-weighted scans were acquired at 0.5x0.5x5mm3 resolution in 9 minutes with the following parameters: T1 - 3D FFE, TR/TE/flip angle = 30ms/4ms/60&#x000b0;, T2*-weighted - multi-slice FFE, TR/TE/flip angle = 305ms/9ms/25&#x000b0;. Conventional T2*-weighted turbo spin echo scans were obtained in the same patients at 3T using a standard clinical protocol. 7T scans were obtained in 15 healthy controls and 23 MS patients. The SNR and CNR were calculated.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> We were able to obtain T1, T2*, PD weighted axial sequences, as well as T2 w sagittal sequences, in under 15 minutes. On the other hand, the high SNR of 7T allows us to aim for high in-plane resolutions. While clinical resolution scans can be performed in 2 minutes, we were able to get twice the clinical resolution, 0.5 x 0.5 mm, in a 3 minute scan.WM SNR and WM-Lesion CNR were 2.1 and 1.8 times higher at 7T compared to 3T. In sagittal T2 scans, 4.5 +/- 1.5 lesions were detected at 7T compared to 2.5 +/- 2.2 at 3T. Spinal cord cross sectional area at C2/3 space was 75.34 +/- 9.36 sq mm in MS patients, compared to 83.87 +/- 4.87 sq mm in healthy controls.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> In this first ever report of 7T MRI in large numbers of MS patients, we show significant gains in in-plane resolution (more accurate determination of cord atrophy) and lesion detection. Due to the higher SNR and CNR afforded at 7T, evaluation of the SC in MS shows a significant improvement in lesion visualization compared to the clinical standard at 3T. Finally, 7T SC MRI allows for more accurate assessment of the magnitude and extent of SC involvement in patients with MS, which may provide greater confidence in diagnosis and treatment monitoring.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section12-1352458514547846"><title>P496</title><sec id="section13-1352458514547846"><title>Multi-center upper cervical spinal cord areas obtained from brain MRI scans at 3T in patients with MS</title><p><underline>N Papinutto</underline><sup>1</sup>, R Schlaeger<sup>1,2</sup>, A Zhu<sup>1</sup>, F Khalid<sup>3</sup>, VV Oommen<sup>3</sup>, S Tauhid<sup>3</sup>, BAC Cree<sup>1</sup>, SL Hauser<sup>1</sup>, HL Weiner<sup>3</sup>, R Bakshi<sup>3</sup>, RG Henry<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>UCSF, Neurology, San Francisco, CA, United States, <sup>2</sup>University of Basel, Neurology, Basel, Switzerland, <sup>3</sup>Harvard/BWH, Neurology, Brookline, MA, United States</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Upper cervical cord area (UCCA) is strongly associated with physical disability in MS patients, particularly in advanced stages of disease. Many sites do not routinely acquire MRI that can provide reliable measures of UCCA. We performed a 3T MRI study using standard brain high-resolution 3D T1-weighted (T1W) volumes that included the upper cervical cord to provide estimates of UCCA.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To compare the multi-site utility of UCCA determined from brain T1W MRI to direct spinal cord MRI-obtained UCCA in patients with MS.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Brain MPRAGE sequences (sagittal 1mm isotropic voxels) were acquired at the Brigham Women&#x02019;s Hospital (BWH, n=12) and UCSF (n=68), as part of the SUMMIT consortium. Both sites used the same Siemens Skyra 3T MRI, 20-channel head and neck coil, and pulse sequence. UCCA was determined using JIM software, independently at the 2 sites. UCCA was compared within each site with spinal cord specific sequences (T2W images at BWH and PSIR at UCSF). A subset at UCSF (n=12) was matched for sex, EDSS, and disease duration for comparison of MPRAGE-derived UCCAs and correlation with disability to evaluate multi-center data integration.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> BWH: N=12, 8 females, mean (SD): 17 (15) years disease duration, 3.0 (2.1) EDSS, 10 RRMS, 1 SPMS, 1 PPMS. UCSF: N=68, 44 females, 17 (11) years disease duration, 2.9 (1.8) EDSS, 50 RRMS, 15 SPMS, 3 PPMS. Brain MPRAGE UCCA were BWH: 72(7) mm2 and UCSF: 71(10) mm2. Strong correlations were found between the UCCA from MPRAGE and spinal cord specific sequences (Pearson BWH R2=0.63, UCSF R2=0.96). Correlation coefficients for EDSS predicted by UCCA from MPRAGE were BWH: Spearman r=&#x02212;0.74 p=0.006; Pearson r=&#x02212;0.66, -0.90: -0.14 CI and in the matched UCSF cohort: r=&#x02212;0.73, p=0.007; Pearson r=&#x02212;0.64, -0.89: -0.11 CI. Combining the datasets we found (N=24) Spearman r= &#x02212;0.69, p&#x0003c;0.001; Pearson r=&#x02212;0.63, -0.83: -0.31 CI). The correlations from the cord specific sequences were similar or lower. Statistical power (alpha=0.05) for the combined MPRAGE-UCCA data was 0.96 for N=24 while power for the individual sites were 0.71 and 0.67 for N=12 and predicted power at N=24 was 0.96 and 0.95.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Across sites, concordant UCCA values and correlations with EDSS were found. No loss of power due to combining data was observed. Such data potentially provide readily accessible UCCA estimates for integration in large multi-site trials and can provide an estimate of spinal cord atrophy without direct cord images.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section14-1352458514547846"><title>P497</title><sec id="section15-1352458514547846"><title>Identification of tissue-specific MRI markers to assess protection and repair in response to fingolimod</title><p><underline>C Berrios-Otero</underline><sup>1</sup>, L Fleysher<sup>2</sup>, J Zhang<sup>1</sup>, E Fieremans<sup>3</sup>, G John<sup>1</sup>, M Inglese<sup>4</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, Neurology, New York, NY, United States, <sup>2</sup>Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, Radiology, New York, NY, United States, <sup>3</sup>New York University, Radiology, New York, NY, United States, <sup>4</sup>Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, Neurology, Radiology and Neuroscience, New York, NY, United States</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> While the immunological effects of Fingolimod are well established, there is controversy regarding its role in promoting tissue repair. Advanced MRI techniques such as diffusion tensor (DTI) and diffusional kurtosis imaging (DKI) provide information about tissue microstructure.

MUCCA was the only independent variable for predicting clinical disability measured by EDSS in NMO (R<sup>2</sup>=0.22, p&#x0003c; 0.001) and MS (R<sup>2</sup>=0.16 p=0.019).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> NMO showed predominately spinal cord atrophy with mild brain atrophy mainly in WM, while MS demonstrated much more severe brain atrophy especially in GM. MUCCA is the essential MRI-derived parameter for explaining clinical disability in NMO and MS, and may serve as a potential biomarker for further clinical trials especially in NMO.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section18-1352458514547846"><title>P499</title><sec id="section19-1352458514547846"><title>MR frequency shift imaging as a sensitive measure of longitudinal changes in multiple sclerosis lesions</title><p><underline>V Wiggermann</underline><sup>1,2</sup>, E Hernandez-Torres<sup>2,3</sup>, IM Vavasour<sup>2,3</sup>, C Laule<sup>2,4</sup>, AL Mackay<sup>1,2</sup>, DKB Li<sup>2,5</sup>, A Traboulsee<sup>3,5</sup>, A Rauscher<sup>2,3</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>University of British Columbia, Physics and Astronomy, Vancouver, BC, Canada, <sup>2</sup>University of British Columbia, Radiology, Vancouver, BC, Canada, <sup>3</sup>UBC MRI Research Centre, Vancouver, BC, Canada, <sup>4</sup>University of British Columbia, Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Vancouver, BC, Canada, <sup>5</sup>University of British Columbia, Neurology, Vancouver, BC, Canada</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Multiple sclerosis (MS) is characterized by the appearance of focal and diffuse lesions in the brain and spinal cord due to demyelination, episodic inflammation and axonal damage. Magnetic resonance (MR) frequency images contain quantitative information related to tissue magnetic susceptibility and microstructure.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> As shown in a previous serial study (Wiggermann et al., Neurology 81, 2013), MR frequency increases sharply when new lesions appear and remains elevated for at least 6 months. Here, we present long-term follow up (LTF) data from the previous short-term study cohort. We hypothesize lesions will demonstrate a reduction in the MR frequency signal due to axonal destruction and axonal loss, in agreement with theoretical predictions.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> 8 subjects with relapsing-remitting MS (at LTF: mean age=44.5yr (range: 34-57yr), median EDSS=2.5 (range: 1-4.5), mean disease duration=15.4yr (range: 7-30yr)) were scanned monthly over 6 months and received one LTF scan after 3.2-5.6 years on a 3T Philips Achieva system. 3 healthy controls (age=38-48yr) were scanned at months 0, 6 and LTF. FLAIR (Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery) and Gd-enhanced T<sub>1</sub>w images were acquired for lesion detection. Frequency shift images were acquired using a 3D single Gradient Echo sequence (FOV=240x166x64mm<sup>3</sup>,voxel size =0.43x0.43x1mm<sup>3</sup>, TR/TE=40/20ms) and registered using FSL&#x02019;s FLIRT. Regions of Interest were manually defined on MR frequency images for enhancing lesions, normal- appearing white matter (NAWM) and normal WM (NWM) in controls. Statistical analysis was performed using a linear mixed effect model.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Visually, new MS lesions seen at months 0-6 nearly disappeared on MR frequency shift images at LTF. After the initial frequency increase at month 0-6, the frequency decreased over time while control regions remained constant (NAWM in subjects, p=0.3; and NWM in controls, p=0.8). The decrease in frequency of new lesions at LTF was significant compared to months 2-6, which showed elevated frequency shortly after first appearance (p=0.004).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our data is in good agreement with theoretical predictions (Yablonskiy et al., PNAS 109, 2012) of frequency shifts in MS lesions. The preliminary results demonstrate the sensitivity of frequency shifts to measure microstructural changes in MS lesions at high spatial resolution, which occur due to the destruction of the myelin sheath and axonal damage. Remyelination could also explain the observed decrease in frequency at long-term follow up.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section20-1352458514547846"><title>P500</title><sec id="section21-1352458514547846"><title>Distinction between neuromyelitis optica and multiple sclerosis using multi-voxel pattern classification</title><p><underline>MA Sahraian</underline><sup>4</sup>, V Wottschel<sup>2</sup>, M Calabrese<sup>3</sup>, A Eshaghi<sup>1</sup>, D Alexander<sup>5</sup>, O Ciccarelli<sup>2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran, Islamic Republic of, <sup>2</sup>Queen Square MS Centre, University College London (UCL) Institute of Neurology, London, United Kingdom, <sup>3</sup>Department of Neurological and Movement Sciences, University of Verona, Verona, Italy, <sup>4</sup>Multiple Sclerosis Research Center, Neuroscience Institute, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran, Islamic Republic of, <sup>5</sup>Centre for Medical Image Computing and Computer Science (CMIC), University College London, London, United Kingdom</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Neuromyelitis optica (NMO) is often the alternative diagnosis in patients misdiagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS), because patients with both diseases share some similarities.

However, application of these criteria is not always straightforward and may delay diagnosis in patients who do not develop the required number of WML. An alternative approach to support a diagnosis of MS using MRI may be to detect a histological feature characteristic of MS <italic>in vivo</italic>. One such feature, the &#x02019;central vein&#x02019; in WML, has become accessible through application of T<sub>2</sub>* based techniques. FLAIR* is a post-processing algorithm combining T<sub>2</sub>* with an established sequence for WML detection - fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR).</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To explore whether FLAIR* could be superior to current MRI DIS/DIT criteria with respect to making a diagnosis of MS using MRI datasets acquired at a single time point and at a standard MRI field strength (3T).</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Seventeen people (11 men; age 39&#x000b1; 8.6 years; disease duration 7&#x000b1; 5.3 years) with relapsing MS (pwRMS) had MRI using a 3T system to acquire 3D FLAIR (after Gadolinium injection) 3D T<sub>2</sub> and T<sub>2</sub>*. FLAIR* images were constructed using MIPAV (mipav.cit.nih.gov) and JIST (nitrc.org/projects/jist/) image processing software. FLAIR* images were assessed by two observers independently, unaware of patients&#x02019; clinical information. WML &#x0003e;3mm were identified, their location and the presence of a central hypointensity suggestive of a vein (central vein sign; CVS) recorded. The proportion of CVS positive (CVS+) WML was calculated for each patient. A proportion of &#x0003e;40% CVS+ WML was considered diagnostic for MS. The McNemar test was used to compare diagnoses based on a proportion of &#x0003e;40% CVS+ WML with diagnoses made using DIS/DIT criteria <italic>applied at a single time point</italic> on the same MRI datasets.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> In 17 pwRMS, 239 WML were identified. Inter-observer agreement for the presence of the CVS was good (&#x003ba; = 0.63). 88% of WML were CVS+. All pwRMS met the diagnostic criterion (CVS+ in &#x0003e;40% of WML). All pwRMS met current MRI DIS criteria, but only 1/17 met DIT criteria using MRI acquired at a single time point.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> FLAIR* reliably enables detection of a characteristic histological feature of MS WML, the central vein, <italic>in vivo.</italic> This may simplify the diagnosis of MS.

However, the routine implementation of this measure has been limited by technical constraints, particularly poor reproducibility and insensitivity to small changes. We have recently reported a reproducible method for measuring upper cervical cord cross-sectional area (UCCA) in MS that combines 3D phase sensitive inversion recovery (PSIR) imaging and an active surface model (ASM).</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To measure spinal cord atrophy by using this new methodology in a progressive MS cohort at one-year follow-up, and assessing its association with physical disability.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> We recruited 31 progressive patients: 18 with secondary progressive (SP), 13 primary progressive (PP) MS and ten controls. Physical disability was estimated at baseline and one-year follow-up using the expanded disability status scale (EDSS). All subjects had 3T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of their cervical cord at both time points. The MRI protocol included a 3D-PSIR acquisition centred at C2/C3 with resolution of 0.5 x 0.5 x 3 mm<sup>3</sup> and UCCA was measured from these images using the ASM. To measure differences between MS and controls and changes from baseline to follow-up, unpaired and paired t-tests were used; univariate correlations between UCCA and EDSS were calculated using Spearman&#x02019;s rank correlation coefficient.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> At baseline, progressive MS subjects (PP and SPMS combined) had a smaller UCCA than controls (68.13mm<sup>2</sup> &#x000b1; 10,89 vs. 83.21mm<sup>2</sup> &#x000b1; 7,92, p = 0.0002). There was a significant progression of clinical disability in MS patients (p= 0.0001) and a significant decrease in UCCA in both patient groups over one year (decrease in PPMS: 1.44mm<sup>2</sup>, 2.02%, SPMS: 1.33mm<sup>2</sup>, 2.03%). A reduction of UCCA in healthy controls was not detected. Thirteen of the 31 patients had an increase in their EDSS during the 12-month period, and they exhibited a greater reduction in cord area during the year (decrease in UCCA: 2.08 mm<sup>2</sup> &#x000b1; 4,16 vs 0.87 mm<sup>2</sup> &#x000b1; 0,35; p = 0.023) compared with the 18 patients whose disability status was unchanged.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> This newly developed method detects change in UCCA over the relatively short period of one year in both SP and PPMS patients.

Thirty-one age- and sex-matched, non-fatigued, healthy controls (HC) were used as control group. A clinical evaluation, including the EDSS score, was obtained in all RRMS patients . Al subjects underwent a 3T MRI including conventional and DTI sequences. Gray (GM) and white matter (WM) atrophy were estimated using SIENAX software.

However, recent studies show that MS is a &#x0201c;whole-brain&#x0201d; disease. Although conventional MRI techniques have good capability of detecting WM lesions, they can barely detect &#x0201c;invisible&#x0201d; damages in normal appearing white matter (NAWM) and cortical gray matter (GM). Previously we demonstrated that MRI-based Gradient Echo Plural Contrast Imaging (GEPCI) technique, allowing simultaneous generation of naturally co-registered multi-contrast images (T1-weighted, T2<sup>*</sup> or R2<sup>*</sup> maps and frequency maps) from a single MR scan, can provide important information on tissue damage in MS lesions.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> In this paper we use GEPCI technique to quantitatively assess those &#x0201c;invisible&#x0201d; tissue damages in NAWM and GM of MS subjects with different subtypes.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> All studies were approved by local IRB. High resolution (1x1x3mm<sup>3</sup>) brain GEPCI data (T1 weighted and R2* maps) were acquired from 10 relapsing remitting (RM), 10 primary progressive (PP) and 10 secondary progressive (SP) MS subjects using a multi-gradient-echo sequence with 10 echoes on a 3T SIEMENS Magnetom Trio. By using a previously developed theoretical model, R2<sup>*</sup> was separated into two components: cellular part (R2<sup>*</sup><sub>c</sub>) and vascular part (R2&#x02019;). Standard clinical MPRAGE images were also collected and put into &#x0201c;FreeSurfer&#x0201d; to generate brain segmentation. By using &#x0201c;FLIRT&#x0201d; tool in &#x0201c;FSL&#x0201d;, MPRAGE images were registered to GEPCI-T1-weighted images, which are naturally co-registered with GEPCI R2<sup>*</sup>/R2<sup>*</sup><sub>c</sub>/R2&#x02019; maps. Median values of R2<sup>*</sup>/R2<sup>*</sup><sub>c</sub>/R2&#x02019; were calculated for all FreeSurfer regions in each subject. A previously acquired healthy baseline data was used to calculate z-scores of MS subjects in all FreeSurfer regions. Tissue in regions that have low z-scores (&#x0003c; -1.96) was considered damaged.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> We found that 30% of RR, 50% of PP and 50% of SP subjects have damage in NAWM. For cortical GM, the percentages are 20%, 40% and 70% correspondingly. For the globus-pallidus region R2* values are higher than normal: 50% of RR, 20% of PP and 10% of SP have z-score &#x0003e; 1.96.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The results in this study shows that quantitative GEPCI R2<sup>*</sup>/R2<sup>*</sup><sub>c</sub> measurements can be considered as robust bio-markers to evaluate &#x0201c;invisible&#x0201d; tissue damages in NAWM and cortical GM, which can be difficult to evaluate using conventional methods.

Our approach utilizes whole-brain and voxelwise approaches to extensively investigate alterations in white matter and observe their progression over space and time.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To evaluate microstructural white matter damage in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) as measured by brain DTI in patients with varying periods of disease duration.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Axial DTI data was acquired along 31 directions at 2.6mm slices with single shot echo-planar imaging and 2 images without diffusion weighting (b=0) for 90 RRMS patients (age 37.6&#x000b1;1.0 years, 66 females) and 25 healthy controls (age: 35.1&#x000b1;2.2 years; 14 females) on a 3.0T scanner. Patients were grouped to short (&#x0003c; 1 year), moderate (1-6 years) and long (6-10 years) disease duration periods. Whole-brain and voxelwise analyses of fractional anisotropy (FA) data were carried out using tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS). Threshold-free cluster enhancement (TFCE) was performed for voxelwise analysis alongside the JHU ICBM-DTI-81 atlas for major WM tract identification. Student two-tailed unpaired t-test was performed on FA in each significant region&#x02019;s clusters for between-group analyses.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Whole-brain WM FA measurements showed a significant decrease between healthy controls and the short disease duration group (0.47&#x000b1;0.02 versus 0.44&#x000b1;0.02, p &#x0003c; 0.001), as well as between medium and long disease duration groups (0.44&#x000b1;0.02 versus 0.43&#x000b1;0.02, p &#x0003c; 0.01), but failed to show significance between short and medium disease duration groups (0.44&#x000b1;0.02 versus 0.44&#x000b1;0.02, p =0.95). On further inspection, voxelwise analysis revealed diffuse FA reduction spanning a skeletal area of 60,784 of 195,350 total voxels and affecting 38 major WM tracts when comparing healthy controls and the short duration group. FA reduction was also shown in 30 major WM tracts when comparing the long and medium duration groups, affecting 42,212 of 192,208 skeletal voxels.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> DTI data revealed significant disruptive injuries related to disease progression in RRMS patients. Initially, an acute episode of widespread alterations in WM tracts is seen in the first year after diagnosis; however, these changes slow to a plateau in patients with medium disease duration and later demonstrate significant, widespread WM changes in patients with long disease duration. Our findings signify a distinct, non-linear temporal pattern to changes in WM microstructure.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section36-1352458514547846"><title>P508</title><sec id="section37-1352458514547846"><title>Regional cortical thickness in African Americans with multiple sclerosis</title><p><underline>M Alkawaz</underline><sup>1</sup>, E Monohan<sup>1</sup>, JS Perumal<sup>1</sup>, N Nealon<sup>1</sup>, T Vartanian<sup>1</sup>, S Gauthier<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Weill Cornell Medical College/Judith Jaffe MS Center, New York, NY, United States</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> African Americans (AA) have a more aggressive disease process, poorer response to disease modifying therapy, and accumulate more clinical disability as compared to Caucasians (CA). These observations suggest differences in the underlying disease process in AA patients. Previous studies have correlated cortical atrophy with both clinical disability and disease progression. In addition, a specific regional pattern of focal atrophy has been identified in MS patients, which differs from normal aging and implies a disease-specific mechanism for cortical neuronal loss.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> This study was designed to examine the differences in regional cortical thickness between AA and CA MS patients.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Fifty-five AA and 55 CA patients matched for age, disease duration, treatment, and gender were assessed in this study. Using Freesurfer, white matter and grey matter were segmented from the T1 images and were checked for misclassification. Global cortical thickness was measured using Freesurfer. Regional cortical thickness was computed using Qdec, a Freesurfer group analysis tool optimized for display of results on the cortical surface. Monte Carlo simulation was used to control for multiple comparisons set at p&#x0003c; 0.001.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Disability scores (EDSS) were significantly higher in our AA (2.25&#x000b1;2.16) vs CA patients (1.31&#x000b1;1.48) (p=0.0094). AA had more global cortical atrophy in comparison to CA patients (p=0.022). Racial differences in regional cortical thickness were most evident in the right hemisphere, with the superiortemporal (p=0.0001) and precuneus (p=0.04) areas being significantly thinner in AA. In the left hemisphere, the lingual (p=0.032) and inferiortemporal (p=0.0046) regions were significantly thinner in AA as compared to CA.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> We observed significant regional differences in cortical thickness between AA and CA patient cohorts, which were mainly in the temporal lobe, precuneus and lingual area. Our data coincides with previously reported areas of thinning in MS patients in comparison to controls, which suggests a similar disease process in AA and CA patients. The difference in severity could be explained by higher neuronal loss and dendritic atrophy, which may justify the higher clinical disability witnessed in AA in comparison to CA patients.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section38-1352458514547846"><title>P509</title><sec id="section39-1352458514547846"><title>Can we really differentiate spinal cord ischemia from the myelitis of neuromyelitis optica with MRI in the acute setting?</title><p><underline>E Johnson</underline><sup>1</sup>, I Kister<sup>2</sup>, E Raz<sup>1</sup>, J Loh<sup>1</sup>, T Shepherd<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>New York University College of Medicine, Radiology, New York, NY, United States, <sup>2</sup>New York University College of Medicine, Neurology, New York, NY, United States</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Both spinal cord infarct and the acute myelitis associated with Neuromyelitis Optica (NMO) have similar clinical presentations and can be associated with longitudinally-extensive central cord lesions. Clinical management of the two diseases is very different so reliably differentiating these two entities in the acute setting is of paramount importance.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To retrospectively identify useful distinguishing imaging features for differentiating SCI from NMO myelitis during an acute clinical presentation.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> We used a case-control design to compare acute radiographic presentation findings from patients at a tertiary medical center with retrospective definitive diagnoses of NMO (N=9) or angiographically-proven spinal cord infarct (N=12). Patient demographics, clinical presentation and MRI features such as the location, craniocaudal extent and area of cord lesions were categorized and quantified by 2 radiologists. Contrast and diffusion-weighted MRI were not obtained in all subjects.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The age at presentation for acute myelitis did not differ between groups (mean 51 yrs, P&#x0003e;0.05), but cord infarct patients were much more likely to be male and Caucasian (P&#x0003c; 0.05). 50% of all acute NMO lesions clustered specifically at the cervicomedullary, cervicothoracic and thoracolumbar junctions. 50% of spinal cord infarcts were located below T6 and near the conus. Both groups demonstrate cord lesions originating within the central cord with mild expansion, but NMO lesions were more likely to extend into peripheral white matter. The &#x0201c;snake eye&#x0201d; sign, which is classically described as being pathognomonic for spinal cord infarct, was seen in multiple NMO patients. No lesion differences were present between NMO and SCI respectively for craniocaudal length (8.9 &#x000b1; 4.0 vs 6.1 &#x000b1; 2.4 cm) or cross-sectional area relative to cord at the midpoint (31.8 &#x000b1; 8.8 vs 34.8 &#x000b1; 5.9%).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our results indicate that there is a great deal of radiologic overlap between acute spinal cord lesions from NMO or infarct. NMO lesions tended to cluster at spine junction zones, while SCI was mostly see in lower spinal cord. Classic &#x0201c;pathognomonic&#x0201d; MRI features, such as &#x02018;snake eyes&#x02019; in SCI, were not useful for differentiating between the two entities.

Abnormal levels of glutamate reflect the quantity and integrity of synapses and are a promising biomarker of neurodegeneration. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) can non-invasively and quantitatively measure the concentrations of glutamate and other brain metabolites.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> The goal of this study was to use an advanced MRS analysis technique to extract glutamate-specific concentrations, as well as other brain metabolite concentrations, in patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis (RMS) compared to healthy controls.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> 26 RMS subjects participating in a Phase III clinical trial of ocrelizumab (OPERA) were scanned at baseline. In addition, 40 age and gender-matched healthy controls were included. Spectra were measured from a 6.5x4.5x1.8cm<sup>3</sup> white matter voxel and fit with LCModel version 6.3. Concentrations of glutamate, N-acetyl-aspartate (primary role: neuronal integrity), creatine (energy storage), choline (membrane synthesis), and myo-Inositol (glial marker), were calculated relative to the water peak and corrected for voxel compartmentation and relaxation to obtain institutional mM values. The Wilcoxon rank sum was used to test group differences with the Holm-Bonferroni method to address multiple comparisons.</p><p><bold>Results: Glutamate was the only metabolite which showed a significant difference between RMS subjects and controls.</bold> The glutamate concentration was [median (25<sup>th</sup> and 75<sup>th</sup> percentiles)] 6.4 (6.0 - 6.9) mM in RMS] and 7.0 (6.4 - 7.3) mM in healthy controls (p=0.006, uncorrected, significant). There was a trend to lower N-acetyl-aspartate values in RMS subjects as compared to controls: 6.7 (6.3 - 6.9) mM versus 6.9 (6.7 - 7.2) mM, respectively (p=0.021, uncorrected, not significant).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Lower levels of glutamate were found in RMS subjects compared to age and gender matched healthy controls. Lower glutamate levels in RMS subjects may indicate decreased synapse function or density. This result concurs with our previous finding of a decline in both glutamate and glutamine over 2 years in patients with secondary progressive MS. Taken together, these studies suggest that abnormal glutamate homeostasis is a common feature of different MS sub-types and could be potential biomarker of neurodegeneration. These brain metabolites will be measured longitudinally in the OPERA Phase 3 RMS clinical trials.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section42-1352458514547846"><title>P511</title><sec id="section43-1352458514547846"><title>No change in venous, arterial, nor CSF flows in MS patients after 1 year of disease modifying drugs</title><p><underline>S El Sankari</underline><sup>1</sup>, O Bal&#x000e9;dent<sup>2</sup>, V van Pesch<sup>1</sup>, T Duprez<sup>1</sup>, C Sindic<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Universit&#x000e9; Catholique de Louvain, Brussels, Belgium, <sup>2</sup>Amiens University Hospital, Amiens, France</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Venous dysfunction has been recently hypothesized to contribute to the pathological mechanisms of Multiple Sclerosis (MS). Phase Contrast (PC) -MRI is a non-invasive technique providing reliable quantification of CSF (cerebrospinal fluid) and blood flows, in both intracranial and cervical levels.

Fast cine PC-MRI sequences were performed in 3 slice locations, at the levels of: i: the Sylvius Aqueduct with flow encoding velocity (Venc) for CSF at 10 cm/s; ii: the spinal canal with Venc at 10 cm/s for CSF and 80 cm/s for internal carotid arteries (ICA), Vertebral arteries (VA), and internal jugular veins (IJV); and iii: coronal plane (Venc at 80 cm/s) for superior longitudinal sinus (SLS), straight sinus (SS) and both transverse sinuses (TS). Images were analyzed using a home-made software to extract CSF oscillations and calculate arterial and venous flows curves during the cardiac cycle. Stroke volumes of CSF, and mean arterial and venous individual flows were calculated. The same imaging protocol was performed 1 year later, and results were compared using a Wilcoxon test.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> At 1 year, 7 patients were treated with Natalizumab (Nzb), and 6 with Fingolimod (Fgd). Among patients with CIS, 4 were treated with immunomodulatory drugs, 3 remained untreated. Two relapses occurred during the follow-up of patients treated with second line drugs (Nzb and Fgd), with a significantly reduced relapse rate as compared to pre-treatment period (p=0.01). No new T2 nor enhancing T1 lesions were observed.Venous flows demonstrated high heterogeneity and right-sided dominance. At 1 year, no significant change was observed for flow quantification. Vascular and CSF flow values were comparable at both time points for all patients (p &#x0003e; 0.05). No correlation was found between the presence/absence or the type of treatment, and the evolution of flows, particularly venous flows.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our study is the first to follow venous drainage in a MS population.

NMO is characterized by episodes of inflammation and damage to astrocytes that can result in optic neuritis and myelitis. Unlike MS, the immune attacks in NMO are believed to be mediated by antibodies targeting the protein aquaporin 4. While MS and NMO differ immunologically, they have extensive similarities in terms of conventional imaging exams and clinical manifestations that make clinical differentiation difficult. However, prognosis and optimal treatment for these diseases are very different.</p><p>Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) provides a functional method for assessing the integrity of central motor pathways.

Filling methods can be divided into local techniques, which use the intensities from the surrounding neighboring voxels of the lesions to fill them, and global techniques, which use WM intensities from the whole brain.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To propose a new approach (SLF) to fill multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions in T1-w images that overcomes some of the existing limitations of the global and local filling techniques.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> For each T1-w slice composing the whole brain image, WM lesion voxel intensities are replaced by random intensities of a normal distribution generated from the mean WM intensity of the current slice. Compared to global methods based on the mean signal intensity of all slices, our method re-computes the mean signal intensity of the WM at each two-dimensional slice with the aim of reproducing more precisely the signal variability between slices, especially in low resolution images.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> We computed the deviation in GM and WM tissue volume between a set of healthy images and the same images where artificial WM lesions similar to the mean GM/WM interface were filled with the proposed technique. Manual annotations done by experts of WM lesion masks from MS patients were registered into two sets of 30 1.5T and 3T T1-w images of healthy subjects, respectively. Tissue volume was computed using FAST and SPM8 segmentation methods. The results were compared with three state of the art filling methods (Chard et al., Battaglini et al., Magon et al.). The results on 1.5T showed that SLF reduced the deviation in WM between original and filled images, independently of the segmentation method used. SLF also provided the lowest differences in GM when FAST was used, and a similar performance to Chard et al., when SPM8 was employed. On 3T data, SLF again provided the lowest differences in GM and WM tissue when FAST was used. When SPM8 was used, SLF presented also a similar performance to Chard et al. Furthermore, volume estimations of lesion filled images using SLF appeared to be not affected by the segmentation method.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The proposed method obtained satisfactory results in both 1.5T and 3T, improving especially the results in low resolution images.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a central tool in MS follow-up and improved MRI measurements of MS disease activity are warranted. Dynamic susceptibility contrast MRI (DSC MRI) is currently the best established MRI-based perfusion method providing several hemodynamic parameters. Cerebral blood volume (CBV), cerebral blood flow (CBF) and mean transit time (MTT) can be potentially useful for characterizing disease activity in MS.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> The objective of the study was to explore the potential usefulness of DSC MRI in characterizing affected brain tissue in MS and to establish its possible association with disease activity.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Newly diagnosed patients with relapsing-remitting MS were included in the study (n=68, age between 22 and 49 years, 50 females and 18 males, mean disease duration 26 months, mean EDSS score 2.0). MRI was performed at 1,5 T (Avanto, Siemens Medical, Erlangen, Germany) using a DSC MRI sequence with 19 slices and voxel size 1.8 x 1.8 x 5 mm<sup>3</sup>. Binary masks of white matter lesions (WML), normal appearing white matter (NAWM) and grey matter (GM) created from volumetric fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) and T1 series were co-registered to the resulting perfusion maps. Perfusion analysis was performed using NordicICE software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nordicneurolab.com">www.nordicneurolab.com</ext-link>). Coregistration and WM/GM segmentation was performed in SPM8 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm">http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm</ext-link>). WML masks were automatically generated using Cascade software (Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden). Perfusion parameters (CBV, CBF and MTT) were extracted from the whole compartments of WML, NAWM and GM. Differences in perfusion metrics between WML and NAWM were tested using paired samples t-test and non-parametric Wilcoxon signed rank tests. Statistical analysis was performed in SPSS (version 21).</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> CBV in WML (mean 14.01; SD 4.51; CI [12.88; 15.15]) was significantly increased (p&#x0003c; 0.001) compared to NAWM (mean 11.99, SD 3.43, CI [11.14; 12.83]). Also MTT in WML (mean 3.64; SD 0.65; CI [3.48; 3.81]) was significantly increased (p&#x0003c; 0.001) relative to NAWM (mean 3.17; SD 0.49; CI [3.07; 3.32]). CBF did not differ in WML and NAWM.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> CBV and MTT are significantly increased in WML compared to NAWM in newly diagnosed MS patients, indicating that DSC MRI may be used to evaluate inflammatory activity in MS.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section54-1352458514547846"><title>P517</title><sec id="section55-1352458514547846"><title>Cellular and microstructural changes due to iron deposition in multiple sclerosis lesions</title><p><underline>Y Ge</underline><sup>1</sup>, H Sheng<sup>1</sup>, S Chawla<sup>1</sup>, I Kister<sup>2</sup>, J Herbert<sup>2</sup>, RI Grossman<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>NYU School of Medicine, Radiology, New York, NY, United States, <sup>2</sup>NYU School of Medicine, Neurology, New York, NY, United States</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) has been emerged as a useful clinical tool in detecting iron deposition in many neurological diseases including multiple sclerosis (MS). Although several studies reported increased iron deposition in some MS lesions, its impact on brain tissues&#x02019; microstructure has been poorly understood.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> This study is to evaluate the microstructural changes measured with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in MS lesions with and without iron deposition on SWI.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Seventeen patients with relapsing remitting MS (mean age: 35.8&#x000b1;9.8 years, mean EDSS: 2.9&#x000b1;1.8) were recruited for this study. MRI was performed on a 3T machine with conventional T1- and T2-weighted imaging, SWI and DTI. The imaging parameters of SWI include TR/TE=55/18ms, FA=20&#x000b0;, voxel size=0.49x0.49x2mm<sup>3</sup>. The SWI was processed using both magnitude and phase information with 2-slice mIP (4mm thick) and phase multiplication factor of 4. DTI data were acquired using 30 directions with a single-shot spin-echo, echo-planar sequence with voxel size=1.8&#x000d7;1.8&#x000d7;3mm<sup>3</sup> and b=1000 s/mm<sup>2</sup>. The data were processed offline using DTI studio. The corrected raw tensor images were combined to construct mean diffusivity (MD) and fractional anisotropy (FA) maps. The MS lesions with iron deposition were defined as hypointense on both phase (i.e., higher susceptibility) and SWI minimal intensity projection (mIP) images. MD and FA were measured and co-registered in corresponding lesions with and without hypointensity on SWI due to iron component.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 127 lesions were identified in these patients. Among them, 48 lesions had hypointense component (i.e., due to iron deposition) on phase and SWI, while 79 lesions did not show hypointensities. The averaged FA was found to be significantly different (p&#x0003c; 0.0001) between lesions with iron deposition (0.33&#x000b1;0.09) and lesions without (0.26&#x000b1;0.09), significant reduction (p=0.02) of MD was also observed in lesions with iron content (1.01&#x000b1;0.21mm<sup>2</sup>/s) versus lesions without (0.99&#x000b1;0.18mm<sup>2</sup>/s).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The significant difference of FA and MD between MS lesions with and without iron deposition may suggest a role of iron on microstructural tissue injury and recovery. It is worth noting that lesions with iron deposition in this patient group showed less tissue destructive indicated by higher FA and lower MD as compared to lesions without iron deposition, and such findings may be associated with initial blood products evolution and warrant further investigation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section56-1352458514547846"><title>P518</title><sec id="section57-1352458514547846"><title>Imaging of brain perfusion in multiple sclerosis and neurodegenerative disorders: association with endothelial factors.</title><p><bold>An interim analysis</bold></p><p><underline>E Tedeschi</underline><sup>1</sup>, R Lanzillo<sup>2</sup>, M Mancini<sup>3</sup>, C Russo<sup>1</sup>, A Cianflone<sup>2</sup>, R Liuzzi<sup>3</sup>, S Cocozza<sup>1</sup>, E Postiglione<sup>2</sup>, G Palma<sup>3</sup>, M Caprio<sup>3</sup>, M Incoronato<sup>4</sup>, C Criscuolo<sup>2</sup>, V Brescia Morra<sup>2</sup>, M Salvatore<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Federico II University, Advanced Biomedical Sciences, Napoli, Italy, <sup>2</sup>Federico II University, Neurosciences, Reproductive and Odontostomatological Sciences, Napoli, Italy, <sup>3</sup>Institute of Biostructure and Bioimaging - National Research Council, Napoli, Italy, <sup>4</sup>IRCSS SDN Foundation, Napoli, Italy</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Among the factors contributing to brain damage in Multiple Sclerosis (MS), scientific evidences indicate ischemic changes, venous outflow abnormalities and accumulation of pro-inflammatory and neurotoxic substances.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> This project aims at acquiring new knowledge about the association of determinants of brain perfusion in patients with MS and neurodegenerative diseases such as Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), combining Magnetic Resonance (MR) and Ultrasound (US) imaging of the brain and intracranial and extracranial circulation, and endothelial factors.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> 300 MS patients, 50 ALS patients, and 300 healthy subjects (HS) will be recruited over 3 years. To assess the vascular genetic susceptibility, serum levels of homocystein and endothelial factors will be assayed, as well as the association between the C677T polymorphism of methylen-tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), informative SNPs in VEGF-A, Endothelin 1 and HIF1A genes and micro and macro vascular abnormalities in MS and ALS. With MR, we will assess the arterial inflow and mean transit time using brain Perfusion Weighted Imaging (PWI), the state of the deep intracranial veins using Susceptibility Weighted Imaging (SWI), and measure iron deposits in the basal ganglia using dedicated software. Extracranial and transcranial color-Doppler US with time intensity curve analysis was used to quantitatively evaluate cerebral inflow and outflow parameters and cerebral perfusion.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> In the first year we recruited 228 MS patients, 33 ALS patients and 67 HS. Homocystein levels (HL) were assessed in 132 patients, VEGF-A in 50 patients and in 25 HS. Median HL were similar in MS and ALS patients (13.2 vs 16.0, &#x000b5;mol/L, p=0.2). Higher-than-normal HL were found in 32.2% of MS (CI 24-41%) and 66.7 % of ALS patients (CI 30-92%), but not significantly different in the two groups (p= 0.08). Instead, median HL were significantly higher in males with MS compared to females (17.3 vs 13.9 &#x000b5;mol/L, p&#x0003c; 0.001) .VEGF-A values tended to be higher in MS patients vs HS (251.7 vs 145.7 U/mL, p=0,4). 101 patients (78 RR, 2 PP, 11 SP and 10 ALS) underwent contrast-enhanced brain MR, and 68 patients (54 RR, 1 PP, 10 SP and 3 ALS) underwent US evaluation.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Combining different imaging modalities and laboratory analysis may provide new insights into the vascular aspects of MS pathogenesis.

Conventional magnetic resonance (MR) outcomes correlate poorly with the patient&#x02019;s clinical status, which might reflect the failure to quantify heterogeneity of MS lesions.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> MR frequency shift (FS) images are sensitive to myelin and axonal loss. This could improve the discrimination of the severity of MS lesion pathology. We compared MR FS in different lesion types to myelin-related MR metrics: magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) and myelin water fraction (MWF).</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> 25 subjects with relapsing-remitting MS (age range: 21-54 years; median EDSS=2) participating in a phase III clinical trial of Ocrelizumab (OPERA) were scanned before treatment initiation. MR FS maps were calculated from a gradient echo scan (TR/TE/&#x00394;TE =38/4/4.5ms, reconstructed voxel size: 0.5x0.5x1mm<sup>3</sup>). MTR and MWF were acquired in addition to FLAIR and gadolinium(Gd)-enhanced T<sub>1</sub> images. All scans were registered to the 22ms echo FS images. MS lesions were defined manually on FLAIR scans. The average FS, MTR and MWF values were computed for each lesion. Kruskal-Wallis and Wilcoxon Rank sum tests evaluated group differences.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> 16 Gd-enhancing, 583 T<sub>2</sub>-hyperintense/T<sub>1</sub>-isointense and 139 T<sub>2</sub>-hyperintense/T<sub>1</sub>-hypointense lesions were identified. T<sub>1</sub>-hypointense lesions differed significantly (p&#x0003c; 0.01) from T<sub>1</sub>-isointense lesions for all three techniques, but FS showed a much larger mean difference (121%) between lesion types than MTR (6%) or MWF (10%). FS varied widely between individual enhancing lesions, but only MTR differentiated enhancing and isointense lesions (p=0.001). Our observations agree with theoretical predictions and experimental findings of FS at different stages of demyelination and axonal loss. Apart from being markers for myelin, MTR is known to be influenced by inflammation and edema, while MWF is noisier than FS images. None of these measures distinguished enhancing from non-enhancing T<sub>1</sub>-hypointense lesions.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> FS images show greater heterogeneity between individual lesions compared to MTR and MWF suggesting that MR FS provides information of lesion variability within subtypes, referring to changes of the myelin state and axonal loss. Monitoring lesions for changes in FS, MTR and MWF could distinguish patterns that indicate success or failure of remyelination in MS lesions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section60-1352458514547846"><title>P520</title><sec id="section61-1352458514547846"><title>MR frequency shift imaging demonstrates that iron accumulation is rare in multiple sclerosis lesions</title><p><underline>V Wiggermann</underline><sup>1,2</sup>, LE Lee<sup>3</sup>, E Hernandez-Torres<sup>1,4</sup>, DKB Li<sup>1,4,5</sup>, AL Mackay<sup>1,2</sup>, IM Vavasour<sup>1,4</sup>, C Laule<sup>1,6</sup>, A Traboulsee<sup>4,5</sup>, A Rauscher<sup>1,4</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>University of British Columbia, Radiology, Vancouver, BC, Canada, <sup>2</sup>University of British Columbia, Physics and Astronomy, Vancouver, BC, Canada, <sup>3</sup>University of British Columbia, Science, Vancouver, BC, Canada, <sup>4</sup>UBC MRI Research Centre, Vancouver, BC, Canada, <sup>5</sup>University of British Columbia, Neurology, Vancouver, BC, Canada, <sup>6</sup>University of British Columbia, Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Vancouver, BC, Canada</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> One of the main radiological signs of multiple sclerosis (MS) is the appearance of focal lesions due to inflammation and blood brain barrier breakdown. Focal lesions on magnetic resonance (MR) frequency images demonstrate variable contrast, which has been attributed to iron accumulation. Histopathology studies, however, report no or low iron content only in the rim of MS lesions, which is in good agreement with recent findings that changes in tissue architecture are also a source of frequency shifts (Wiggermann et al., Neurology 81, 2013).</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> Focal, nearly spherical lesions that contain iron should create a dipolar modification of MR frequency, similar to microbleeds, where hemosiderin is responsible for the dipolar pattern. If frequency shifts are caused by microstructural changes, no such dipole features will be observed, indicating a lack of iron in MS lesions. We investigated focal MS lesions for the presence and absence of dipole patterns in frequency maps.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> 17 patients with relapsing-remitting MS completed serial monthly scanning over 6 months (mean age=39.5yrs (range 28-57yrs), median EDSS=2.5 (range 1-6), mean disease duration=9.4yrs (range 1-27yrs)). Gradient echo frequency shift images were acquired (FOV=240x166x64mm<sup>3</sup>, reconstructed voxel size=0.43x0.43x1mm<sup>3</sup>, TR/TE=40/20ms) along with FLAIR (Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery) and T<sub>1</sub> Gd-contrast enhanced scans, which were used to identify enhancing lesions and spherical T<sub>2</sub>-hyperintensities. All MR images were registered to the baseline frequency image. Lesions were classified as dipolar if they showed a ring of reduced frequency in the equatorial plane and areas of increased frequency above and below the lesion. Field distortions due to deoxyhemoglobin in veins were excluded.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> In 9/17 subjects, 37 focal enhancing and 90 focal non-enhancing lesions were detected. Only 1/37 enhancing lesions and 4/90 of the non- enhancing lesions showed dipole characteristics as described above. We did not observe a prevalence of recently enhancing lesions or non-enhancing lesions to show dipole characteristics (3% vs. 4%).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our findings agree with previous histopathological studies and theoretical suggestions that the frequency contrast is due to microstructural changes rather than changes of magnetic susceptibility due to iron (Yablonskiy et al., PNAS 109, 2012). The lack of dipolar modifications of the magnetic field indicates that iron accumulation is a rare phenomenon in focal MS lesions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section62-1352458514547846"><title>P521</title><sec id="section63-1352458514547846"><title>Characteristics of patients with MRI-only conversion to multiple sclerosis after a clinically isolated syndrome</title><p><underline>WJ Brownlee</underline><sup>1</sup>, JK Swanton<sup>1</sup>, O Ciccarelli<sup>1,2</sup>, DH Miller<sup>1,2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Queen Square Multiple Sclerosis Centre, UCL Institute of Neurology, London, United Kingdom, <sup>2</sup>NIHR University College London Hospitals Biomedical Research Centre, London, United Kingdom</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Up to a quarter of patients with a clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) who have abnormalities on a baseline MRI do not experience a second clinical attack, even with long term follow up. A proportion of these patients satisfy McDonald criteria for a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS) with MRI, but not clinical evidence of dissemination in time and space.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> Based on follow-up of a large, prospectively recruited CIS cohort, to describe the frequency of MRI-only conversion to MS, and the demographic, clinical and MRI characteristics of such patients.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Data were reviewed from a CIS cohort with serial clinical and MRI assessment over the first 6 years after onset. MS was defined according to the 2010 McDonald criteria when there was MRI evidence of dissemination in time and space or a second clinical attack.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> From a cohort of 157 CIS patients followed for a mean of 5.8 years (range 3.0 - 11.9 years), 107 (68%) patients satisfied 2010 McDonald criteria for a diagnosis of MS, of whom 71 had a second clinical attack and 36 had MRI-only evidence of dissemination in time and space. Patients with MRI-only MS were older (mean age 34.3 vs 32.0 years) and more often male (50% vs 25%), but these differences were not statistically significant. Baseline MRI findings (including T2 lesion volume, gadolinium-enhancing lesion number, spinal cord lesion number) were similar in patients with clinical and MRI-only conversion to MS, however, the mean T2 lesion volume 6 years after CIS onset was greater in patients who experienced a second clinical attack (9.82 vs 3.26 ml, p &#x0003c; 0.01). At the last follow up physical disability was greater in those patients with a second clinical attack (mean EDSS 2.5 vs 1.0, p&#x0003c; 0.01).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> A substantial number of CIS patients (23%) have a form of MS that remains subclinical, at least over the first 6 years after CIS onset. There is a need to identify robust early predictors of the subsequent disease course, in order to effectively stratify patients with CIS. Further follow up is required to determine whether patients with MRI-only MS are at risk of physical disability and cognitive impairment in the long term.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section64-1352458514547846"><title>P522</title><sec id="section65-1352458514547846"><title>Discriminative radiological features of multiple sclerosis and neuromyelitis optica in Chinese patients</title><p><underline>S Cheng</underline><sup>1</sup>, R Li<sup>1</sup>, KL Shiu<sup>1</sup>, E Yeung<sup>1</sup>, CN Lee<sup>1</sup>, M Auyeung<sup>1</sup>, CM Cheung<sup>1</sup>, TH Tsoi<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital, Hong Kong, Hong Kong</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Multiple sclerosis (MS) and neuromyelitis optica (NMO) are recognized to be clinically distinct entities which management differs.

They were retrospectively analyzed based on their most updated diagnosis as of March 2014, according to the 2010 McDonald criteria and the 2006 Wingerchuk criteria. All of the brain and spine magnetic resonance images ever performed for each subject were reviewed and compared. Univariate analysis was done by the Fisher&#x02019;s exact test and multivariate analysis was done by logistic regression with forward stepwise model to identify the discriminative value of each radiological feature.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 92 patients were recruited. 3 were excluded due to incomplete data. 62 patients had MS, and 27 had either NMO or NMO spectrum disease. The mean disease duration was 9.2 years. All MS patients had abnormal brain signals during the first attack (100%), and the lesions more commonly involved U-fibres (OR 10.2, p=0.002) and had Dawson&#x02019;s finger appearance (OR 45.4, p&#x0003c; 0.001). Spinal cord lesions in MS patients were more likely to be multiple short segmented (OR 13.2, p&#x0003c; 0.001), and had lateral cord involvement (OR 5.43, p=0.004). In contrast, only 9 NMO patients had abnormal baseline MRI brain (36%, p&#x0003c; 0.001). 2 of the remaining 18 subjects developed brain lesions in subsequent attacks. These brain lesions were more prevalent at the area postrema (OR 13.7, p=0.001) and had cloud-like/tumefactive appearance (OR 13.7, p=0.001). Cord lesions in NMO patients were more prone to be longitudinally extended (LETM, i.e. equal or more than three segments) (OR 28.4, p&#x0003c; 0.001), central (OR 5.43, p=0.004), and associated with cord swelling (OR 13.0, p&#x0003c; 0.001). Cervical cord involvement and periventricular brain lesions were common to both MS and NMO. Multivariate analysis showed that Dawson&#x02019;s finger is the most typical MS feature, while LETM is the strongest discriminative feature favouring the diagnosis of NMO.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our review suggests that radiological features that discriminate NMO from MS in the western population are also applicable in Chinese patients.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section66-1352458514547846"><title>P523</title><sec id="section67-1352458514547846"><title>Central vein detection in MS lesions using FLAIR* at 7T</title><p><underline>BE Dewey</underline><sup>1</sup>, L Vuolo<sup>1,2</sup>, CD Shea<sup>1</sup>, SJ Inati<sup>3</sup>, DS Reich<sup>1</sup>, P Sati<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>National Institutes of Health, National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Stroke, Bethesda, MD, United States, <sup>2</sup>University of Florence, Departments of Neurology and Radiology, Florence, Italy, <sup>3</sup>National Institutes of Health, National Institute of Mental Health, Bethesda, MD, United States</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> FLAIR* has been proposed at 3T for visualization of both veins and lesions [Sati et al., Radiology 2012]. This technique can be utilized for characterizing the presence of central veins within white matter (WM) lesions, a potentially highly predictive marker of MS diagnosis [Quinn MP et al., Front Neurol 2013]. By applying FLAIR* at 7T, the increased signal-to-noise and contrast-to-noise ratios as well as spatial resolution should allow for a more robust detection of these small central veins [Kilsdonk et al., Eur Radiol 2014]. However, there are problems inherent to 7T imaging, such as a strong image bias caused by field inhomogeneity, which must be addressed in order to allow clinicians to read the images reliably.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> This preliminary study aimed to establish an adapted image processing for 7T FLAIR* and quantify WM lesions with a central vein in MS patients scanned using 7T FLAIR* without contrast agent.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Four patients with RRMS (mean age 40 &#x000b1; 5, EDSS 1.5-6.5) provided informed consent and underwent 7T MR imaging. Image acquisition included the following sequences: 3D T2-weighted FLAIR [0.8 mm isotropic resolution, acquisition time (AT) = 6 min], and a custom-built 3D T2*-weighted segmented echo-planar imaging (EPI) [0.5 mm isotropic resolution, AT = 3 min 40 s]. The input images (FLAIR and T2*-weighted) were processed using a multi-step, in-house registration and bias-field correction. The FLAIR* images were then created by multiplying the coregistered outputs. An experienced neurologist then counted lesions within the final FLAIR* volumes, marking each lesion as either containing or not containing a central vein.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 141 white matter lesions were identified in the cerebrum of the four MS patients (mean 35.3 &#x000b1; 23.1). Of those lesions, 136 (96.4% of total lesions) were marked as having a central vein on FLAIR*. The lesions without visible veins were very small (median size 12mm<sup>3</sup>) and primarily located in the upper cerebrum.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> This pilot study indicates that FLAIR* images can be collected at 7T and processed to allow clinicians to detect reliably central veins inside MS lesions. Here, almost all of the white matter MS lesions appeared venocentric.

Cortical areas part of the DMN are also frequently affected by subpial demyelination. Previous studies suggested that cortical atrophy may influence DMN rsFC in MS. However, given that cortical atrophy may result from pathology in both gray and white matter (WM), the link between subpial pathology and rsFC in MS remains elusive.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> We investigated rsFC in the DMN at 7T MRI using a seed-based approach from the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), the most affected DMN area in MS, to determine the relationship between rsFC and regional subpial pathology as a function of cortical depth, as measured by T2* relaxation rates from ultra high resolution 7 Tesla (T) MRI.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Fifteen patients (2 Early MS, 8 RRMS, 5 SPMS) and 7 age-matched controls underwent 7T multi-echo T2* imaging (0.33&#x000d7;0.33&#x000d7;1 mm<sup>3</sup>) for T2* maps; 7T resting state BOLD functional MRI (1.2&#x000d7;1.2&#x000d7;1.2 mm<sup>3</sup>, TR=5s, 90 frames); and 3T MRI for acquisition of T1-weighted images optimized for cortical surface reconstruction using FreeSurfer.

The PCC seed was defined according to Yeo&#x02019;s cortical functional parcellation atlas in FreeSurfer, and rsFC z maps were computed using FSFAST pipeline. We explored in the 34 cortical regions from Desikian atlas 1) differences in rsFC between patients and controls using a Wilcoxon test, 2) the correlation between FC and mean T2* at different cortical depths in MS using Spearman correlation.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Patients showed relative to controls decreased rsFC in several cortical regions including left caudal anterior cingulate (p=8.10<sup>-4</sup>), left superior frontal gyrus, right precuneus, right pars opercularis and right frontal pole (p&#x0003c; 0.05). Increased rsFC in patients versus controls was also found in the right cuneus and right superior parietal gyrus (p&#x0003c; 0.05). In the left precuneus, rsFC decrease was associated with T2* increase (underlying cortical demyelination and decrease of iron content) at 25%, 50% and 75% depth from pial surface (p&#x0003c; 0.05).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Although local subpial pathology correlated with rsFC in one region part of the DMN, different pathological processes other than subpial demyelination might contribute to DMN rsFC changes in MS. These include compensatory mechanisms and the contribution of WM injury.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section70-1352458514547846"><title>P525</title><sec id="section71-1352458514547846"><title>Brain volume loss during the first year of interferon-beta treatment: baseline inflammation and regional brain volume dynamics</title><p><underline>&#x000c0; Vidal-Jordana</underline><sup>1</sup>, J Sastre-Garriga<sup>1</sup>, F P&#x000e9;rez-Miralles<sup>1</sup>, D Pareto<sup>2</sup>, J R&#x000ed;o<sup>1</sup>, C Auger<sup>2</sup>, M Tintor&#x000e9;<sup>1</sup>, &#x000c1; Rovira<sup>2</sup>, X Montalban<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Vall Hebron University Hospital, Multiple Sclerosis Centre of Catalonia, Neuroimmunology Department, Barcelona, Spain, <sup>2</sup>Vall Hebron University Hospital, Magnetic Resonance Unit, Neuroradiology Department, Barcelona, Spain</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Some of the available treatments for multiple sclerosis (MS) have demonstrated to improve the curve of brain atrophy compared to placebo. These results may sometimes be difficult to interpret due to the pseudoatrophy effect. We have recently studied brain volume changes on natalizumab treatment assessing the effect of baseline gadolinium-enhancing (Gd+) lesions on its evolution. We found that brain volume loss occurred at a different rate in patients with and without baseline Gd+ lesions, mainly due to white matter changes.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> We aim to assess brain volume changes occurring under interferon-beta (IFN&#x003b2;) treatment, and to confirm our previous findings on early white matter changes in an independent cohort.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> From a prospective, ongoing cohort of all MS patients starting IFN&#x003b2; treatment as a first line therapy in the MS Centre of Catalonia, 105 patients were included. A brain MRI was performed at baseline (not more than 3 months prior) and 12 months after therapy onset in all patients. Statistical Parametric Mapping 8 software was used for volumetric analysis. Brain parenchymal volume (BP), grey and white matter volumes (GM and WM) at baseline and follow-up were obtained, allowing calculation of percentage changes (BPPC, GMPC and WMPC). Descriptive statistics and lineal regression models were performed.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Nineteen patients were excluded due to missegmentation and two patients were excluded due to outlier values in gadolinium counts, leading to a final cohort of 84 patients. Demographic and clinical characteristics at therapy onset are as follows: mean age was 33.6 years (SD 8.7), median disease duration was 2.8 years (0.3-14), and median annualized relapse rate was 1.5 (1-3.5), and median EDSS was 1.5 (0-6). Forty-nine patients (58.3%) had baseline Gd+ lesions with a median number of 1 (0-18). Mean BPPC, GMPC and WMPC during the first year were -0.52 (SD 1.39), -0.79 (SD 2.05), and -0.24 (2.71) respectively. The regression analysis showed (adjusted by number of Gd+ at follow-up MRI, age, disease duration and baseline EDSS) that baseline number of Gd+ lesions significantly predicted BPPC and WMPC (p=0.013 and p=0.003, respectively) but not GMPC (p=0.777).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Baseline inflammation affects brain volume dynamics during the first year of IFN&#x003b2; therapy mostly due to white matter loss. Baseline inflammation has to be taken into account when interpreting early brain volume changes on therapy.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section72-1352458514547846"><title>P526</title><sec id="section73-1352458514547846"><title>Statistical estimation of quantitative T1 maps using standard clinical modalities</title><p><underline>A Mejia</underline><sup>1</sup>, E Sweeney<sup>2</sup>, B Dewey<sup>3</sup>, C Shea<sup>3</sup>, P Sati<sup>3</sup>, J Harezlak<sup>4</sup>, D Reich<sup>3</sup>, RT Shinohara<sup>5</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Johns Hopkins School of Public Health, Baltimore, MD, United States, <sup>2</sup>Johns Hopkins School of Public Health, Department of Biostatistics, Baltimore, MD, United States, <sup>3</sup>National Institute of Neurological Disorder and Stroke, Bethesda, MD, United States, <sup>4</sup>Indiana University Fairbanks School of Public Health, Department of Biostatistics, Indianapolis, IN, United States, <sup>5</sup>University of Pennsylvania, Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Philadelphia, PA, United States</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Quantitative T1-mapping measures longitudinal relaxation times (T1) and can be used to study differences within normal appearing brain tissue. Many studies have documented increased T1 associated with multiple sclerosis (MS) disease progression in normal appearing white and gray matter. T1-maps hence provide valuable information for studying the progression and treatment of MS. However, T1-maps are often more time-consuming and difficult to obtain than standard clinical images and are thus not included in standard clinical protocols. A method for estimating T1-maps from commonly available MR modalities would greatly, and retroactively, increase the availability of T1-maps available for research.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> We aim to design a normalization procedure and statistical model to estimate T1-maps using only T1-weighted (T1w), T2-weighted (T2w), proton density-weighted (PDw), and fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) volumes. Our estimated maps should accurately reconstruct observed group-level differences in T1 between MS patients and controls and between MS subtypes.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Two datasets were used to evaluate the performance of our T1-map estimation model. Both datasets included MRI studies from subjects with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS), primary progressive MS (PPMS), and secondary progressive MS (SPMS). All studies included a T1-map, T1w, T2w, PDw and FLAIR volumes. Model training and cross-validation was performed on Dataset 1, and model validation was performed on Dataset 2. Each modality (excluding T1-map) was intensity normalized using z-score normalization (Shinohara et al. 2011) with respect to extra-cerebral soft tissue. This procedure extracts quantitative information from the unitless clinical modalities. Within each tissue class, a voxel-wise spline regression model was fit relating the normalized T1w, T2w, PDw and FLAIR intensities to the T1-map intensity.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Both the acquired and estimated T1-maps showed SPMS patients having statistically significant differences in T1 compared with PPMS and SPMS patients in lesions. The group difference in median T1 was 155.1 ms using the acquired T1-maps and 75.3 ms using the estimated T1-maps.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> We have proposed and validated a method for estimating quantitative T1-maps using commonly available scans. Following further validation, this method can be used to greatly increase the availability of T1-maps for research of MS and other neurodegenerative diseases.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section74-1352458514547846"><title>P527</title><sec id="section75-1352458514547846"><title>1-H MRSI in patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis at 7 Tesla</title><p><underline>Y Li</underline><sup>1</sup>, BAC Cree<sup>2</sup>, A Zhu<sup>2</sup>, D Leppert<sup>3</sup>, N Seneca<sup>3</sup>, SJ Nelson<sup>1,4</sup>, RG Henry<sup>1,2,4</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>University of California San Francisco, Radiology and Biomedical Imaging, San Francisco, CA, United States, <sup>2</sup>University of California San Francisco, Department of Neurology, San Francisco, CA, United States, <sup>3</sup>F.

With improved detection of myo-Inositol (mI), glutamate (Glu), glutathione (GSH), GABA, glutamine (Gln), and glycine (Gly) at 7T, it is possible to investigate these molecular markers of inflammation, axonal injury and repair in MS.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To compare brain metabolite levels in patients with relapsing MS (RMS) and healthy controls.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> 639 1cc-voxels were studied in 14 subjects (7 RMS patients enrolled in a phase III clinical trial of ocrelizumab (Roche ORCHESTRA programs) and 7 healthy controls). 3D H-1 MRSI was obtained at 7T. Quantification with LCModel provided valid estimates for mI, Glu, tCho, GSH, NAA, Glx (Glu+Gln), mI-Gly, GSH in &#x0003e; 90% of voxels. The regions included 361 white matter (WM) voxels from controls, 187 normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) and 91 T2 lesion (T2L) voxels from patients. These results were computed based on ratios to Creatine (Cr). Wilcoxon rank sum tests were used to compare regions and spearman correlation tests were used to compare metabolites.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Compared to WM, NAWM had (&#x0003c; NAA/Cr***, &#x0003e;mI/Cr**, &#x0003e;GSH/Cr**, Glu/Cr and tCho/Cr not significant) and T2L had (&#x0003c; NAA/Cr***, &#x0003e; mI/Cr***, &#x0003e;tCho/Cr ***, &#x0003c; GSH/Cr*, &#x0003c; Glu/Cr*) where ***:p&#x0003c; 0.0001; **: p&#x0003c; 0.001; *: p&#x0003c; 0.05. Within WM, NAMW, and T2L respectively, NAA/Cr correlation coefficients were -0.26, -0.25, -0.61 vs mI/Cr and -0.32, -0.38, NS vs GSH/Cr. No significance was found on Gln/tCr, GABA/tCr and Glx/tCr between regions. Additional correlation were found in control WM for NAA/tCr with GABA, r=0.43 and Gln/tCr, r=0.38.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> This study demonstrated the application of 7T H-1 MRSI to patients with RMS and healthy volunteers. We found the expected decrease in NAA and increase in mI - but also show that these metabolites are inversely correlated in MS. GSH was elevated in NAWM while decreased in lesions, although inversely correlated with NAA in both lesions and NAWM. When conditioned on NAA, we found a strong (p&#x0003c; 0.0001) decrease in GSH in T2L compared to both NAWM and WM. This observation suggests that oxidative stress may be better understood in functioning axons. We reported this preliminary data in relative concentration to tCr; further analyses will study absolute concentrations. The patients in this study are being followed longitudinally for changes in metabolite levels and lesion evolution.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section76-1352458514547846"><title>P528</title><sec id="section77-1352458514547846"><title>Utilization of routine magnetic resonance imaging in multiple sclerosis patient management</title><p><underline>S Cohan</underline><sup>1</sup>, C Chen<sup>1</sup>, L Grote<sup>1</sup>, T Stuchiner<sup>1</sup>, E Baraban<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Providence Health and Services, Brain and Spine Institute, Portland, OR, United States</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is an important tool in establishing MS diagnosis, as well as monitoring the course of disease and response to therapy. However, little is known about its impact on therapeutic decision- making in clinically stable patients who are receiving disease modifying therapy (DMT).</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To determine the utility of MRI in therapeutic decision-making in clinically stable patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis (RMS), treated with first-line DMT.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> A retrospective chart review was performed, by a trained RN, of all MRIs obtained between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2012 at Providence MS Center. Inclusion criteria were patients with RMS who had been treated with Interferon beta (IFN) or glatiramer acetate (GA) for 12 months or longer. Types, indications, and results of MRI, and whether change of DMT occurred as a result of the scan were documented and analyzed in the study.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The mean age and disease duration of the 518 patients included were 51.2&#x000b1;11.7 and 10.7&#x000b1;7.4 years, respectively. The majority were female (82.2%), had RRMS (94%), and used IFN (79.2%). On average 0.85 MRI were done per patient per year. A total of 1,357 scans were obtained: 64.2% brain, 24.8% cervical spine and 10.5% thoracic-lumbar spine. Of those, 886 met the definition of &#x0201c;routine&#x0201d; MRI, performed in patients who have been clinically stable. Changes were observed on 84 (9.4%) of these scans: 82.3% had new, 22.3% had enhancing, and 14% had enlarged lesions. But only 19 of the 84 changed scans (22.6%), or 2.3% of all routine scans, led to a change in the DMT used.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> It is evident from the results obtained in this patient cohort that one should question the practice of obtaining routine MRI scanning in clinically statle patients who have been receiving DMT. The use of routine MRI has, at least in part, been supported by radiologic evidences of ongoing disease activity in patients who appeared to be clinically stable. However clinical trials have shown that most approved DMTs have a robust effect on suppressing MRI disease activity and thus the low yield on MRI in DMT treated patients should not be surprising. Given the relatively minor clinical impact and the high monetary costs of MS care, the savings that could be achieved by reduction of &#x0201c;routine&#x0201d; MRI is substantial and important in this era of diminishing healthcare resources.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section78-1352458514547846"><title>P529</title><sec id="section79-1352458514547846"><title>Basal ganglia iron in multiple sclerosis patients measured with 7T quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) correlates with inhibitory control task</title><p><underline>P Schmalbrock</underline><sup>1</sup>, D Pitt<sup>2</sup>, AL Boster<sup>3</sup>, JA Nicholas<sup>3</sup>, GK Yang<sup>1</sup>, BL Schirda<sup>4</sup>, AL Janssen<sup>4</sup>, RS Prakash<sup>4</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Ohio State University, Radiology, Columbus, OH, United States, <sup>2</sup>Yale University, Neurology, New Haven, CT, United States, <sup>3</sup>Ohio State University, Neurology, Columbus, OH, United States, <sup>4</sup>Ohio State University, Psychology, Columbus, OH, United States</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Iron increase in the basal ganglia (BG) of MS patients measured by T2 hypointensity has been associated with physical and cognitive disability and correlates with EDSS and brain atrophy. BG are implicated in action selection by influencing/modulating activity of the motor cortex and descending motor pathway through inhibitory control.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> The objective was to examine the association between BG iron and performance on measures of inhibitory control. Given the functional significance of BG to engage in task-relevant information, while ignoring task-irrelevant information, we hypothesized a negative association between iron deposition and measures of inhibitory control.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> With IRB approval, 22 RRMS patients age 30-60y had 7T MRI (TR/TE/flip= 23ms/4-20ms/5, 0.5mm isotropic). Quantitative Susceptibility Maps (QSM) were computed using a novel Wiener filter. Globus pallidus, putamen and caudate were manually traced. All patients underwent comprehensive neuropsychological testing involving assessment of working memory, episodic memory, selective attention, and inhibitory control. Specifically, we examined associations between iron and interference scores on the Stroop and Flanker tasks. The Stroop task involves presenting list of colored words, and requires responding to the color of the word, while ignoring the identity of the word (congruent, incongruent and neutral conditions). The Flanker task presents five arrows, and participants are asked to respond to the direction of the central arrow, while ignoring the flanking arrows (congruent, incongruent conditions). The dependent variables are reaction time (RT) and accuracy (Acc) interference scores measuring greater conflict in the incongruent, relative to the congruent condition for both tasks. QSM and measures of inhibitory control were correlated using Spearman&#x02019;s rho (one-tailed).</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Our novel QSM processing retained anatomic detail with only minimal streaking and blurring artifact. Small vessels and regional variability were seen in BG. Mean susceptibility values for the ROIs had 5-19% error and correlated with age and EDSS. Higher iron deposition in globus pallidus and caudate was associated with RT interference score on the Flanker, but not the Stroop task.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> We have preliminary support for an association between BG iron and performance measures of inhibitory control. Future directions of the ongoing study include a more parsimonious examination of iron deposition with nuanced measures of inhibitory control.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section80-1352458514547846"><title>P530</title><sec id="section81-1352458514547846"><title>Predictor status of disease modifying therapy time-exposure to brain atrophy using NeuroQuant</title><p><underline>AS Nielsen</underline><sup>1,2</sup>, M Kita<sup>1</sup>, J Baker<sup>3</sup>, J Haug<sup>3</sup>, J Siegal<sup>3</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Virginia Mason Medical Center, Neurology, Seattle, WA, United States, <sup>2</sup>University of Washington School of Medicine, Neurology, Seattle, WA, United States, <sup>3</sup>Virginia Mason Medical Center, Radiology, Seattle, WA, United States</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Brain atrophy in multiple sclerosis (MS) occurs at a faster rate than the normal population.

Potential predictor variables of brain volume screened: age, gender, intracranial volume (ICV), disease duration, progressive disease status, and patient-year DMT exposure.

Independent predictors of brain volume include ICV and progressive disease status which suggests that NeuroQuant may help identify relevant neurodegenerative tissue changes of the brain in routine clinical practice. Exposure-time on DMT is not an independent predictor of brain volume and may suggest a beneficial effect of DMT in mitigating the rate of whole brain atrophy in MS.

In all patients, the severity of cognitive and physical fatigue was rated using the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS). Full factorial and multiple regression analyses were performed with SPM8. A time modulation analysis was also performed.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Compared with HC, both nF and F-MS patients had increased activations of the right precentral gyrus, right inferior temporal gyrus (ITG) and bilateral cerebellum. Compared to HC and nF patients, F-MS patients had reduced activations of the left middle temporal gyrus, left supplementary motor area (SMA), bilateral superior frontal gyrus, left postcentral gyrus, left putamen and bilateral caudate nucleus. They also showed selective increased activation of the right middle frontal gyrus (BA46). This latter finding was mainly driven from F MS patients with disease duration longer than 5 years. In HC, the time modulation analysis showed a reduced activity of the SMA and right precentral gyrus and increased activity of the basal ganglia over time. Such a behaviour was significantly impaired in F MS patients. In MS patients, higher activity of the right MFG was related to cognitive (r=0.39; p&#x0003c; 0.001) and physical MFIS score (r=0.36; p&#x0003c; 0.001).

Quantitative values such as lesion volumetry are expected to have high impact in clinical practice. However, manual lesion quantification is time-consuming, costly, and suffers from observer variability.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> We propose an accurate, automatic method for lesion quantification based on MRI, which is independent of the scanner and acquisition protocol and does not require a validated patient population.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> 3D T1-weighted and FLAIR MR images are used simultaneously in a probabilistic model to segment the brain tissue into grey matter, white matter and cerebrospinal fluid using expectation-maximization, allowing for an outlier class in order to accommodate the lesions. Lesion segmentation is performed based on prior knowledge that lesions appear hyperintense on FLAIR images.</p><p>20 multiple sclerosis patients participated in a study at VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.

The total lesion volume obtained from the automatic segmentation is 10.02 &#x000b1; 6.91 mL (range: 1.32 to 26.04 mL), while that of the manual segmentation equals 13.78 &#x000b1; 8.31 mL (range: 1.88 to 28.99 mL).

Complementary information is thus provided to the MS clinicians, supporting early diagnosis.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sensitively detects white matter lesions (WML). Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) allows easy discrimination of supratentorial WML from cerebrospinal fluid, but traditional FLAIR scans are less sensitive to infratentorial lesions. Dual-echo, T2-weighted (T2w) and proton density (PD) sequences are more sensitive than FLAIR for visualizing infratentorial WML, but image quality and conspicuity of infratentorial lesions still need to be improved.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To combine the contrast of PD and T2w sequences for improvement of infratentorial image quality and better assessment of infratentorial WML.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Participants with clinically defined MS underwent a comprehensive 3T-MRI protocol. Whole brain, 2D dual-echo T2-weighted fast spin echo scans were acquired (slice thickness, 3mm; acquisition time, 1 minute 57 sec; repetition time, 5320 msec; echo time 1, 23 msec; echo time 2, 116 msec). T2-w and PD sequences were averaged, resulting in a new image, &#x0201c;P2T&#x0201d;. Each of two trained raters evaluated the 3 sequences separately. Qualitative assessment was performed for supratentorial and infratentorial image quality and lesion conspicuity using a grading system.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> MRI data from 16 patients (8 women; mean age, 42 years) were analyzed. All lesions visible on PD and T2w were also seen on P2T. Furthermore, P2T received high grades for infratentorial and supratentorial image quality, superior to T2w (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) and PD (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001).

The three main functional connectivity metrics characterizing the brain network topology namely the long-range connectivity (nodal efficiency, Enod), the short-range connectivity (local efficiency, Eloc) and the density of connections (degree, k) were assessed. Connectivity metrics in healthy controls remained stable over time. In the second step of the study, 43 patients with relapsing-remitting MS (mean age 37&#x000b1;5.1 years, mean disease duration 10&#x000b1;3 years) were included. They underwent rs-fMRI at baseline and at two years.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> At baseline, significant increase of global brain connectivity metrics were evidenced in patients (for Enod, p=0.040, Eloc, p=&#x0003c; 0.001, and k, p=0.030). During the follow-up period, Enod and k of patients decreased to reach normal values at year 2. Between baseline and year 2, Eloc decreased significantly but remained higher than normal values (p&#x0003c; 0.001). At the regional level, long-range functional connectivity and density of connections reflected by Enod and k respectively were increased mainly in hubs at baseline, whereas high short-range connectivity reflected by Eloc was equally distributed throughout the brain. Finally, the decrease in the reorganization of brain functional topology during the follow-up period was associated to the progression of disability in patients (rho=0.30, p=0.02).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> This longitudinal rs-fMRI study evidenced that brain functional reorganization characterized by widespread higher functional connectivity, involving mainly the hubs, dramatically decreased with disease progression. The disruption of reorganization in brain functional topology was significantly associated with disability progression suggesting that compensatory mechanisms progressively failed with the course of MS.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section94-1352458514547846"><title>P537</title><sec id="section95-1352458514547846"><title>Combined DIR and PSIR images improve detection and classification of cortical lesions in multiple sclerosis and clinically isolated syndromes</title><p><underline>A Favaretto</underline><sup>1</sup>, D Poggiali<sup>1</sup>, P Perini<sup>1</sup>, F Rinaldi<sup>1</sup>, G Rolma<sup>2</sup>, F Causin<sup>2</sup>, P Gallo<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>University Hospital of Padova, Department of Neuroscience, Padova, Italy, <sup>2</sup>University Hospital of Padova, Neuroradiology, Padova, Italy</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Cortical gray matter lesions (CL) constitute a relevant aspect of multiple sclerosis (MS) pathology. Studies based on double inversion recovery (DIR) images have demonstrated an association between CL load and both cognitive and physical disability in MS patients. However, DIR detects only 20% of pathologically con&#x0fb01;rmed CL. Recently, phase-sensitive inversion recovery (PSIR) was demonstrated to be more sensitive and accurate that DIR in detecting CL.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> We combined DIR and PSIR images to analyse the frequency and the type of CL in MS patients having different disease duration (DD) and degree of disability, including patients with clinically isolated syndromes suggestive of MS (CIS).</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> 30 patients (20 MS, 10 CIS) were included in the study (F/M=2.0; DD range: 0.2-22 years; age range: 21-50 years; EDSS range: 1-6.0). DIR and PSIR images were acquired by a 3T MRI (Philips) and inspected by 3 experts, with identification of CL by consensus. PSIR and DIR images were jointly used to classify lesions as purely intracortical, mixed gray-white matter (leukocortical), and juxtacortical. The difference in the number of lesions detected by PSIR and DIR in each category was analyzed.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Combined DIR/PSIR images allowed: 1) the identification of CL in 100% of the patients, independently of DD and EDSS score, 2) the detection of CL in all the CIS suggestive of MS (with dissemination in space of lesions), 3) a significant increase (&#x0003e;60%) in the number of detected CL (intracortical+leukocortical) compared to DIR alone, 4) the re-classification of about 15% of CL detected by DIR. Moreover, PSIR allowed the identification of 233% more leukocortical lesions, 30% intracortical and 53% juxtacortical compared to DIR.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our data further strengthens previous observation and shows that the combination of DIR and PSIR images allows the detection of a signi&#x0fb01;cantly greater number of CL than DIR alone. Moreover, we confirm the higher accuracy and sensitivity of PSIR in classifying the types of lesions. The presence of at least one intracortical lesion in all CIS patient further points out the relevance of cortical pathology in MS. DIR/PSIR images may be useful when a diagnosis of MS is suspected but not con&#x0fb01;rmed and may allow a better stratification of the patients for clinical studies.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section96-1352458514547846"><title>P538</title><sec id="section97-1352458514547846"><title>Compensatory remapping of fMRI functional connectivity during resting state in multiple sclerosis</title><p><underline>S-J Lin</underline><sup>1</sup>, A Liu<sup>2</sup>, ZJ Wang<sup>2</sup>, D Leppert<sup>3</sup>, N Seneca<sup>3</sup>, E Vianna<sup>3</sup>, A Dzyakanchuk<sup>3</sup>, S Kolind<sup>4</sup>, A Traboulsee<sup>4</sup>, MJ McKeown<sup>4</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>University of British Columbia, Neuroscience, Vancouver, BC, Canada, <sup>2</sup>University of British Columbia, Electrical and Computer Engineering, Vancouver, BC, Canada, <sup>3</sup>F.

Compensatory mechanisms, whereby functional connectivity between brain regions is enhanced to compensate for disrupted connectivity elsewhere may represent an independent therapeutic target to minimize overall disability.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To determine if there are robust alterations in fMRI connectivity patterns in patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis (RMS) compared to age and gender matched healthy controls.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Twenty-five RMS patients enrolled in a Phase III clinical trial of ocrelizumab (OPERA) and 29 age- and gender-matched controls were scanned at baseline. Resting state fMRI scans were acquired with resolution 80x80 mm, 36 slices, 240 volumes and TR 2000 ms (8 min). Cortical parcellation was performed in Freesurfer and 38 ROIs, including cognitive regions, were chosen for connectivity analysis. Data preprocessing was performed with in-house scripts which partially included SPM and FSL (FMRIB) functions. Connectivity analysis was derived using a PCfdr-initialized Bayesian Network (BN) learning approach. The group-wise false-discovery rate was set at 5%. In addition, simple correlation results were calculated to compare to the BN approach.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> RMS subjects had increased overall connectivity compared to controls (p &#x0003c; 0.001) using correlation approach. However, the strength of overall connectivity from the BN approach was comparable between groups (connection strength of MS/normal: 0.26 &#x000b1; 0.22/0.24&#x000b1;0.23). These results suggest a fundamental remapping of connectivity involving inferior prefrontal regions: in controls this area was connected to superior frontal and medial orbitofrontal regions, whereas in RMS subjects it was connected to anterior cingulate and posterior parietal regions. In posterior cingulate regions, connections to/from orbitofrontal and precuneus regions in controls were connected to supramarginal regions in RMS.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The results emphasize the importance of distinguishing direct <italic>vs</italic> indirect (co-activation) connectivity in MS, which is possible with the BN approach but not with correlation analysis. Our observations suggest that the increased overall co-activation in MS is a result of de-differentiation of normally focal connectivity patterns between discrete regions. The co-activation changes in RMS likely represent compensatory, broadly-enhanced connectivity of still intact pathways.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section98-1352458514547846"><title>P539</title><sec id="section99-1352458514547846"><title>Permeability of the blood-brain barrier predicts conversion from optic neuritis to multiple sclerosis</title><p><underline>SP Cramer</underline><sup>1,2</sup>, HJ Simonsen<sup>1</sup>, JL Frederiksen<sup>2</sup>, HBW Larsson<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>University of Copenhagen, Glostrup Hospital, Functional Imaging Unit, Department of Diagnostics, Glostrup, Denmark, <sup>2</sup>University of Copenhagen, Glostrup Hospital, Department of Neurology, Glostrup, Denmark</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> We have previously reported increased permeability of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in normal appearing white matter (NAWM) in patients with multiple sclerosis (Cramer et al. 2013). 50% of patients with Optic Neuritis (ON) later develop MS (Marques et al. 2013).</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> We aimed to investigate if BBB permeability can predict later conversion to MS according to the McDonald 2010 criteria. Furthermore, we aimed to validate our MRI measure of BBB permeability by correlating with inflammatory markers from the cerebrospinal-fluid (CSF); leukocyte count, IgG-index and biomarkers for inflammation and cellular trafficking, namely matrix-metallo-protease-9 (MMP-9), C-X-C chemokine ligand 10 (CXCL-10) and CXCL-13 in ON patients and healthy controls (HC).</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI at 3T (Larsson et al. 2009) was used to measure BBB permeability in 31 ON patients, all referred for MRI as part of diagnostic workup at time of diagnosis.

Patients had MRI and lumbar puncture performed within 2 weeks of onset of ON symptoms.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> We found a significantly higher (p=0.005) permeability of the BBB in periventricular NAWM in ON patients compared to HCs. In normal appearing grey matter and thalamic tissue, no such difference was found. Pooling ON patients and HCs we found that BBB permeability correlated (linear regression) with the following CSF markers: Leukocyte count (log10), R<sup>2</sup>=0.30; p=0.0002 and CXCL10 (log10), R<sup>2</sup>=0.15; p=0.01. In ON patients with conversion to McDonald MS within 2 years after initial diagnosis of ON we found significantly higher BBB permeability in periventricular NAWM (2-tailed T test; p=0.015).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our results indicate a higher degree of leakiness of the BBB in ON patients who later develop MS, emphasizing the importance of very early BBB pathology in NAWM. However, ON patients who did not convert to MS also had significantly higher permeability when compared to HCs, indicating that BBB permeability is also a marker of non-specific CNS inflammation, although it must be kept in mind that the observation period was only two years. We find a significant correlation between BBB permeability in NAWM and several CSF markers of inflammation and cellular trafficking, which seems to validate BBB permeability as a marker of CNS inflammation. Measuring BBB permeability could be an important supplementary prognostic marker for determining later conversion from ON to MS.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section100-1352458514547846"><title>P540</title><sec id="section101-1352458514547846"><title>Comparison of visual conspicuity between two contrast-enhanced T1-weighted sequences in the detection of multiple sclerosis lesions with 3.0T MRI</title><p><underline>F-X Aymerich</underline><sup>1</sup>, C Auger<sup>1</sup>, P Alcaide<sup>1</sup>, D Pareto<sup>1</sup>, E Huerga<sup>1</sup>, J-F Corral<sup>1</sup>, R Mitjana<sup>1</sup>, J Sastre-Garriga<sup>2</sup>, X Montalban<sup>2</sup>, &#x000c1; Rovira<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Vall Hebron University Hospital, Magnetic Resonance Unit, Neuroradiology Dept., Barcelona, Spain, <sup>2</sup>Vall Hebron University Hospital, Multiple Sclerosis Centre of Catalonia, Neuroimmunology Dept., Barcelona, Spain</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> It is not well established whether gradient-echo (GE) or spin-echo (SE) is the sequence of choice to detect enhancing multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions with 3.0T MRI.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> The aim of this study was to compare the ability of these two sequences to detect active MS lesions.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> 100 MS patients (73 women; mean age, 35.8 years; age range [23, 50] years, median EDSS, 3; EDSS range, [0, 8]), underwent 3.0 T brain MRI (Trio, Siemens) including enhanced GE and SE T1-weighted sequences. GE images were acquired 15 minutes after injection of a double dose (0.2 mmol/kg) of gadobutrol. In half of the patients, SE images were acquired just before, and in the other half just after, acquisition of the GE images. To define the gold standard, an experienced neuroradiologist identified and marked contrast-enhanced MS lesions in these sequences using Jim 5.0 software. Each of the two sets of contrast-enhanced T1W scans was then evaluated in a random order by three experienced neuroradiologists. The results were compared with the gold standard reference to obtain the number of true-positive (TP), false-negative (FN), and false-positive (FP) evaluations. Quantitative assessment of lesion conspicuity and the effect of spatial location were based on image contrast and the contrast-to-noise ratio, and division of the intracranial region into four quadrants in each slice.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> We found 607 MS lesions (105 periventricular, 274 subcortical, 165 juxtacortical, and 63 infratentorial).

Additionally, alterations in corticospinal tract activation could contribute to the increased difficulty in ambulation seen in many patients with MS. Larger future studies are needed to expand the generalizability of these findings.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section106-1352458514547846"><title>P543</title><sec id="section107-1352458514547846"><title>Treatment effect on brain atrophy differs between first and second-line therapies for relapsing-remitting MS: a meta-analytic approach</title><p><underline>P Branger</underline><sup>1</sup>, J-J Parienti<sup>2</sup>, G Defer<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>University Hospital Center of Caen, Department of Neurology, Caen, France, <sup>2</sup>University Hospital Center of Caen, Biostatistic and Clinical Research Unit, Caen, France</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Quantification of brain atrophy in relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) could be a marker of clinical state, disease progression and treatment response but no one study compared effect of first-line and second-line disease-modifying drugs (DMD) on cerebral volume.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> The aim of this study is to compare effect of first-line and second-line DMD on brain atrophy progression up to 48 months of follow-up through a meta-analytic approach.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> We reviewed all reports in Medline, Embase and Cochrane database about trials in RRMS assessing effect of DMD, including all phase II-III drug trials and reporting data about cerebral atrophy. For each study, number of patients, percentage of brain volume change (PBVC) to baseline, technique of atrophy measurement and DMD were collected. Glatiramer acetate, interferon, teriflunomide, dimethyl fumarate and laquinimod were classified as first-line DMD and natalizumab, fingolimod, daclizumab and alemtuzumab classified as second-line ones. To compare effect of DMD, we used a Generalized Estimated Equation, adjusting for time-trend and group, in the SaS 9.4 software between PBVC and time for first-line, second-line and placebo groups. 2 periods were analyzed, the total one up to 48 months (A) and between month 12 and 48 (B) to correct pseudo-atrophy effect.

For period B, annual slope of atrophy was reduced for second-line DMD compared to placebo (0.10%/y vs 0.55%/y, p=0.0001) and first-line DMD (0.46%/y, p=0.005).

In addition to producing an accurate objective classifier, we sought to determine which types of features are most important for successful classification.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> In addition to basic clinical measures (EDSS, PASAT, disease duration) and demographic variables (age, gender), our classifier uses a wide range of lesion-specific measures. Using lesion masks defined on T1w, T2w and T1w-Gad-enhanced images, individual lesions are identified with FSL&#x02019;s cluster program. Lesion geometry is measured with Minkowski functionals, i.e. lesion volume, surface area, mean breadth and Euler-Poincare characteristic (EPC). Lesion &#x0201c;texture&#x0201d; is based on intra-lesion intensities in each respective image type. Lesion-specific values are aggregated into whole-brain or white-matter track-specific summaries (incl. sum, min, max, mean, median and standard deviation). Lesion segmentation was done for all image types and 250 subjects using a strict semiautomatic protocol with two independent raters and review by a third.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Good classification could be obtained with clinical and demographic features alone (average accuracy 39%; chance = 20%). However, even better accuracy was found with the addition of geometric and intensity measures (47.8% accuracy). SVM weights showed that the significance of various features largely depends on the subtypes involved during classification: e.g. median T2w lesion volume has a positive weight for relapsing-remitting MS and a negative weight for primary progressive MS. For most classifiers, T2w features are more important than their T1w counterparts. Additionally, EPC showed higher weights than lesion count; median lesion volume, area and mean breadth were more useful than the respective means; finally, better prediction accuracy was obtained by decomposing scores by ROI tracks than using whole brain summaries.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> We found that prediction of MS subtypes can be made more accurate by using different aspects of lesion geometry and intra-lesion intensity measures.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section110-1352458514547846"><title>P545</title><sec id="section111-1352458514547846"><title>Thoracic spinal cord lesions are influenced by the degree of cervical spine involvement in multiple sclerosis</title><p><underline>LH Hua</underline><sup>1</sup>, SL Donlon<sup>2</sup>, MJ Sobhanian<sup>3</sup>, S Portner<sup>3</sup>, DT Okuda<sup>3</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Cleveland Clinic, Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health, Las Vegas, NV, United States, <sup>2</sup>Arizona Neurological Institute, Phoenix, AZ, United States, <sup>3</sup>University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Department of Neurology &#x00026; Neurotherapeutics, Dallas, TX, United States</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a demyelinating disease affecting both the brain and spinal cord. Advances in imaging techniques have improved the ability to detect spinal cord lesions, facilitating the diagnosis of MS and the identification of important disability correlates. As the cervical spinal cord is more frequently involved, little is known about its relationship to the presence of lesions within the thoracic spine.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To determine if the presence of cervical spine lesions predicts the presence of thoracic spinal cord lesions in patients with MS.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> All MS patients, with MRI studies of the brain, cervical, and thoracic spine obtained during a single scanning session were consecutively acquired during a 1-year period from a single MS clinic. The presence of cervical spine demyelinating lesions was analyzed as a predictor of thoracic spinal cord involvement. Clinical, demographic and imaging covariates were used in a multivariate regression model to refine predictors of thoracic spine involvement.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 687 patients were consecutively evaluated over a 1-year period. The study cohort was comprised of 126 patients (94 women, median age = 39 years (y), interquartile range 32-49 y). Excluded were 561 patients due to a diagnosis of other neuroinflammatory or neurological disorders, or not meeting 2010 McDonalds criteria for MS (n=222) or incomplete neuraxis imaging (n=339). The presence of at least 1 demyelinating lesion within the cervical and thoracic spinal cord was identified in 105 (83.3%) and 86 (68.3%) patients, respectively. There was an increase in the odds of thoracic spine involvement when any cervical spine lesion was present (odds ratio (OR) = 6.08, 95% confidence interval [2.21-16.68], p&#x0003c; 0.001). The multivariate logistic regression model demonstrated a substantial increase in the odds of thoracic spine involvement with each increasing number of cervical spine lesions: for 2 lesions (OR 4.44, [0.914-21.60], p=0.06), 3 lesions (OR 19.76, [3.51-111.17], p=0.001), 4 or more lesions (OR 20.49, [1.97-213.23], p=0.012), and diffuse cervical spine lesions (OR 71.94, [5.2-979.88], p=0.001) when adjusting for significant covariates including brain lesions, disease duration, and treatment exposure.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our findings suggest that the presence of thoracic spinal cord lesions is predicated on the presence and degree of cervical spine involvement in patients with MS, a risk that appears to be independent of brain findings or clinical features.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section112-1352458514547846"><title>P546</title><sec id="section113-1352458514547846"><title>Glutamate as a marker for disease progression in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis using magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging</title><p><underline>V Fleischer</underline><sup>1</sup>, R Kolb<sup>2</sup>, E Reuter<sup>1</sup>, U Klose<sup>2</sup>, F Zipp<sup>1</sup>, A Gr&#x000f6;ger<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>University Medical Center of Mainz, Neurology, Mainz, Germany, <sup>2</sup>University of T&#x000fc;bingen, Department of Diagnostic and Interventional Neuroradiology, T&#x000fc;bingen, Germany</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) offers the possibility to detect metabolic alterations in combination with morphological changes.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> In our study, we aimed to differentiate RRMS patients with mild and fulminant disease progression by identifying reliable metabolic markers of disease severity. Clinical classification was based on the current treatment level of the MS patients.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> MRSI data were acquired from 44 RRMS patients (female: 32, mean age: 36.1). Fourteen patients were receiving no medical therapy (NT), 17 immunomodulatory baseline therapy (BT) and 13 escalation therapy (ET). The latter were treated with Natalizumab, recently reported not to change metabolite concentrations pre- to post-treatment in MRSI. These 44 RRMS patients as well as 20 healthy controls (HC) were examined using a 2D-PRESS sequence with water saturation at 3 T.</p><p>The volume of interest was localized above the corpus callosum in all subjects. MRSI data were analyzed using LCModel to estimate white-matter metabolite levels (N-acetylaspartate [NAA], glutamate and glutamine [Glx] and myo-inositol [Ins]). One-way ANOVA tests were used to compare the concentrations in 4 central white-matter voxels between the four groups.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Ins concentrations were increased in all patient groups, increasing continuously from the HC to ET group.

However, our study demonstrated that metabolites of neuronal excitotoxicity (Glx) were specifically upregulated in the patient group with a more aggressive disease course, indicating surrogate factors for progression. Interestingly, as other groups have reported, we found no reduction in NAA in our groups. Thus, if one does not question NAA as a parameter for neuronal integrity, it must be concluded that neuronal excitotoxicity precedes neuronal loss, indicated by the higher Glx but stable NAA values in all our patient groups.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section114-1352458514547846"><title>P547</title><sec id="section115-1352458514547846"><title>Grey-matter atrophy rate is not related to disease activity or MRI lesion accumulation in relapsing-remitting MS patients: a longitudinal study</title><p><underline>A Damasceno</underline><sup>1</sup>, BP Damasceno<sup>1</sup>, F Cendes<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>University of Campinas, Neurology, Campinas, Brazil</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> For a long time MS has been regarded as a demyelinating autoimmune disorder of the central nervous system related to T lymphocytes autoreactive for myelin. However, there is also an axonal degeneration that is present from the early stages of the disease and seems to correlate better with the progressive neurological disability. The relation between inflammation and neurodegeneration is currently intensively debated and, at later stages of MS, brain atrophy often occurs in the absence of new inflammatory lesions. However, in the earlier stages of the disease where inflammation is more pronounced, there is little data addressing the contribution of disease activity to GM atrophy.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To evaluate the influence of clinical features and MRI lesion accumulation in GM atrophy rates in RRMS patients.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Forty-two RRMS patients and 30 controls were followed up for 24 months. All individuals underwent MRI (3T) including FLAIR, DIR and a volumetric T1 at baseline, 12- and 24-months. Clinical features evaluated were: relapses during follow-up and in the previous 2 years, disease duration and gender. MRI metrics included accumulation of cortical and WM lesions, and gadolinium-enhancing lesions during follow-up. GM atrophy rates (cortical and subcortical) were calculated. Group comparisons and correlations were performed with age as covariate. Multivariate analyses were performed to assess the contribution of clinical and MRI metrics to GM atrophy rates.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> In the patients group, atrophy rates were significantly higher than controls for cortical (2.57 vs. 0.11%, p = 0.023) and subcortical GM volumes (3.80 vs. 1.33%, p = 0.004). GM atrophy rates (cortical and subcortical) were neither related to clinical features (p &#x0003e; 0.1) nor to MRI metrics (p &#x0003e; 0.1). On multivariate analyses no clinical or MRI factor remained in the model as predictor of GM atrophy rate.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> GM atrophy is significantly higher in RRMS patients when compared to healthy subjects but atrophy rate is not influenced by clinical factors, disease activity or accumulation of demyelinating lesions.

MRI sequences sensitive to susceptibility may therefore have the potential to serve as markers of disease activity in MS patients. According to Maxwell&#x02019;s equations, both solid and shell distributions of susceptibility can lead to shell-like patterns on phase imaging, whereas quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM), by deconvolving the phase images, directly depicts the underlying susceptibility sources. This has been demonstrated in numerical simulations and MRI phantoms experiments. Here we investigate whether the same patterns are present in <italic>in vivo</italic> MS patient imaging data.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To demonstrate geometrical patterns created by MS lesions on phase and QSM and to explore whether shell-appearing lesions on phase may correspond to either solid or shell lesions on QSM.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> T2-weighted (T2w), high-pass-filtered phase, and QSM images for twenty consecutive MS patients were reviewed in accordance with the NYPH Institutional Review Board. For each MS patient, a neuroradiologist identified the largest lesions on the T2w images. The morphology of each lesion was then characterized as &#x0201c;solid&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;shell&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;not seen&#x0201d; on the phase and QSM images.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Of the 60 lesions identified in T2w images of the 20 MS patients, 42 lesions were detected in QSM with 35 (83%) solid and 7 (17%) shell, 33 lesions were detected in phase with 10 (30%) solid and 23 (70%) shell. Of the 23 shell-like lesions detected on phase, 16 (70%) appeared solid on QSM, 5 (22%) appeared shell on QSM, and 2 (8%) were not visible on QSM. Of the 5 shell-like lesions detected on QSM, all 5 (100%) lesions were also shell-like on phase.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Given previous work validating that QSM accurately depicts solid and shell patterns of magnetic susceptibility, here we show that phase imaging may depict <italic>in vivo</italic> MS lesions with solid susceptibility distributions as shell-like. QSM also detects more lesions than phase imaging. In light of the potential importance of susceptibility geometry in characterizing clinically relevant characteristics of MS lesions, QSM should be included in future MRI studies of susceptibility in MS.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section118-1352458514547846"><title>P549</title><sec id="section119-1352458514547846"><title>Angle resolved R2* is sensitive to tissue changes: study in MS patients and controls</title><p><underline>E Hernandez-Torres</underline><sup>1</sup>, V Wiggermann<sup>1</sup>, TR Baumeister<sup>1</sup>, Y Zhao<sup>2</sup>, D Sadovnick<sup>3,4</sup>, DKB Li<sup>1,3</sup>, A Traboulsee<sup>2,3</sup>, A Rauscher<sup>1,3</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>UBC MRI Research Centre, Radiology, Vancouver, BC, Canada, <sup>2</sup>UBC, Neurology, Vancouver, BC, Canada, <sup>3</sup>UBC, Brain Research Centre, Vancouver, BC, Canada, <sup>4</sup>UBC, Departament of Medical Genetics, Vancouver, BC, Canada</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Focal lesions in brain&#x02019;s white matter (WM) are a radiological hallmark of Multiple Sclerosis (MS). In addition, WM tissue outside focal lesions, referred to as diffusely abnormal and normal appearing WM, is increasingly recognized as being affected by the disease.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> Here, we investigated the transverse magnetic resonance relaxation rate R2* in the normal appearing and diffusely abnormal WM of MS patients, their healthy siblings and unrelated healthy controls.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> We investigated 39 subjects with MS, 31 healthy siblings and 30 age and gender matched controls. Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS): [0 - 6.5], disease duration: [3 - 41]yr. Data acquisition parameters: SWI - acquisition voxel: 0.9x1x1.6mm<sup>3</sup> reconstructed to 0.8x0.8x0.8mm<sup>3</sup>, TR/TE/&#x00394;TE=28/5/5ms, 5 echoes, &#x003b1;=17&#x000b0;. WM was segmented from a combined T1 and T2 image using FSL&#x02019;s FAST (FMRIB&#x02019;s Automated Segmentation Tool). R2* maps were calculated from the multi-echo SWI data by fitting a monoexponential function. As R2* in WM depends also on the microstructural tissue orientation relative to the main magnetic field, the WM fibre orientation from the eigenvectors of a diffusion tensor imaging scan (TR/TE=7465/75 ms, b-value=1000, 16 directions) was determined and the R2* of WM was analyzed in angle intervals of five degrees. The average for all subjects in each group was calculated. At each angle interval, differences among the three groups were evaluated using a Kruskal-Wallis test and in pairwise using a Tukey HSD test.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> While the orientation dependency of R2* was similar in all three cohorts, there was a significant difference at all angles between the MS group and the siblings group and between MS group and the controls (p &#x0003c; 0.05), with R2* being lowest in the MS group, followed by the controls and the siblings. We found also significant differences between the siblings and controls (p&#x0003c; 0.05).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The decrease in R2* in MS patients compared to controls and siblings may be related to increased water content due to edema. Compared to whole-brain histograms of R2*, which overlap due to the fibre orientation dependency of R2*, the proposed approach results in well separated curves for the three cohorts and is able to show subtle differences that are masked otherwise.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section120-1352458514547846"><title>P550</title><sec id="section121-1352458514547846"><title>Vitamin D levels are associated with low cortical thickness in secondary progressive MS</title><p><underline>D Ontaneda</underline><sup>1</sup>, S Planchon<sup>1</sup>, J Cohen<sup>1</sup>, E Fisher<sup>2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Cleveland Clinic, Mellen Center, Cleveland, OH, United States, <sup>2</sup>Cleveland Clinic, Biomedical Engineering Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland, OH, United States</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Vitamin D deficiency is a risk factor for multiple sclerosis (MS).

Accurate measurements of structural thickness provide important information about the integrity of the cerebral cortex and white matter tracts.

Thirty RRMS patients were enrolled and 29 completed the one-year follow-up assessment, mean&#x000b1;SD age was 40.0&#x000b1;8.7 years, disease duration 12.8&#x000b1;6.9 years and EDSS 3.2&#x000b1;1.5. Patients were clinically active in the year prior to enrollment as evidenced by mean progression in the EDSS of 0.4 and a mean number of 1.2 relapses. Patients underwent high-field 3.0T MRI, three-dimensional T1-FSPGR (voxel size 1&#x000d7;1&#x000d7;1 mm) at baseline (prior to initiation of Gilenya treatment) and at 1 year.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) plays an important role in the diagnosis and monitoring of the disease by non-invasively visualizing the focal lesions. There is considerable interest in revealing the degrees of hemodynamic and structural injury of tissue within the MS lesions. Meanwhile, the clinical relevance of these stratified lesions needs to be established.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To test the hypothesis that hemodynamic and structural impairment, as assessed by cerebral blood volume (CBV) and fractional anisotropy (FA), characterizes the extent of tissue injury, and that the load of lesion with substantial tissue destruction would reflect the disease status related to clinical disability.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> A total of 1135 MS lesions were evaluated. 7 relapsing-remitting MS patients and 7 sex- and age-matched controls underwent perfusion, diffusion and conventional MRI scans. CBV and FA were measured in three types of MS lesions: T1-enhanced, T1-hypointense and T1-isointense lesion and compared with values obtained in WM from controls. Brain volumetric measurements and their correlations with lesion volumes and scores of clinical disability were also performed. Two-sample t-test and linear regression (with Pearson correlation coefficient) were used for statistical analysis</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Compared with normal WM, CBV and FA were significantly reduced in the T1-hypointense lesion (p&#x0003c; 0.05), while insignificant changes in both parameters were exhibited in the T1-isointense lesion. Increased CBV but significantly decreased FA (p&#x0003c; 0.05) was detected in the active lesion. Meanwhile, a close spatial relationship between active and T1-hypointense lesion was observed. Lesion load represented by T1-hypointense plus active lesion volume significantly correlated with brain atrophy (R=0.87,p&#x0003c; 0.05), which, in turn, significantly correlated with the severity of clinical disability (R=0.77, p&#x0003c; 0.05).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> A unique combination of CBV and FA characterizes the status of a specific lesion type in MS. A severe structural impairment does not solely occur in the T1-hypointense lesion, but is also associated with the active lesion. A burden of the lesion with extensive structural damage provides an image index, indicative of disease status.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section128-1352458514547846"><title>P554</title><sec id="section129-1352458514547846"><title>Impaired homologous interhemispheric functional connectivity is related to atrophy of the corpus callosum in multiple sclerosis</title><p><underline>S Tobyne</underline><sup>1</sup>, D Boratyn<sup>1</sup>, EC Klawiter<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Neurology, Boston, MA, United States</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Atrophy of the corpus callosum (CC) is a hallmark feature of white matter pathology in multiple sclerosis (MS). Degeneration of the CC is hypothesized to impair communication between homologous regions, symmetric areas of the right and left hemispheres, resulting in abnormal intrinsic functional connectivity profiles. Homologous inter-hemispheric functional connectivity (HIFC) could provide a sensitive biomarker for callosal pathology in MS by mapping inter-hemispheric network integrity.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To explore the relationship between CC atrophy and HIFC in relapsing-remitting (RR) MS compared to healthy controls (HC) using a novel surface-based registration technique for establishing homologous regions.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Anatomical and resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) data were acquired in 20 RRMS (mean disease duration 8.48 years; median EDSS=2.0, range 1-6.5) and 35 age- and gender-matched HC subjects at 3T. Mid-sagittal CC area was calculated following a semi-automated segmentation technique. Atrophy measures were compared between groups with a Mann-Whitney U test. Following registration of preprocessed RSFC data to a precise left-right registered atlas of the reconstructed cortical surfaces, HIFC was calculated by correlating the time course of each vertex to its homologous counterpart using a Pearson&#x02019;s correlation. Data were Fisher&#x02019;s Z-transformed to facilitate between group comparison with a Mann-Whitney U test. Mean whole-brain HIFC and was extracted and compared with CC atrophy measures using a Spearman&#x02019;s correlation.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Mid-sagittal CC area was significantly decreased in RRMS compared to HC (p&#x0003c; 0.001). Mean HIFC was also significantly decreased in RRMS (p=0.001). Mean HIFC correlated with mid-sagittal CC area (rho=0.397, p=0.002).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The results of this study validate and extend previous work on HIFC in RRMS. HIFC calculated using a novel technique based upon the reconstructed cortical surface revealed a significant relationship between deceased HIFC and CC atrophy in RRMS. This suggested that commonly observed CC pathology in RRMS has a significant effect on inter-hemispheric network connectivity. Surface-based HIFC may represent a sensitive early biomarker for increasing CC disease burden in RRMS.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section130-1352458514547846"><title>P555</title><sec id="section131-1352458514547846"><title>Imaging myelin pathology in the gray matter in multiple sclerosis</title><p><underline>Y Wang</underline><sup>1</sup>, C Wu<sup>1</sup>, J Zhu<sup>1</sup>, R Miller<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, United States</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Clinical disability in multiple sclerosis (MS) is often associated with distinct myelin pathology in the central nervous system.

Results may therefore be encumbered by epiphenomena of chronic immune dysregulation, such that abnormalities that contribute to pathogenesis become indistinguishable from those that may emerge as responses to the injury process.

Assay development included miniaturization of FACS panels and validation for use with cryopreserved PBMC obtained using our strict standard operating procedures. Cryopreserved PBMC were obtained from children at presentation with an incident clinical episode of acquired demyelinating syndromes (ADS), as part of our prospective Canadian Pediatric Demyelinating Disease Study.

We analyzed: 1) Samples taken from benign MS patients (n=21); 2) Samples obtained from DD-matched MS patients (n=13); 3) Samples obtained from EDSS-matched MS patients (n=15). Benign patients were defined as those having an EDSS=&#x0003c; 1 at 10 or an EDSS=&#x0003c; 2 at 15 years after diagnosis. Patients were never treated with a disease-modifying treatment.

However the function of oxysterols in CD4<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes has not been assessed. The development and progression of multiple sclerosis result in part from the balance between effector and regulatory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell. Since the original classification of CD4<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes into T<sub>H</sub>1 and T<sub>H</sub>2 subsets, the repertoire of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell has expanded to include additional effector T cell like T<sub>H</sub>17 cell and regulatory T cell, such as Foxp3<sup>+</sup> regulatory T-cell or type 1 regulatory T (T<sub>R</sub>1) cells.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> We proposed to assess the expression of oxysterols in subsets of CD4<sup>+</sup> Thelper and to examine their function during autoimmunity.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Subsets of CD4<sup>+</sup> Thelper cells were generated <italic>in vitro</italic> and expression of oxysterol converting enzymes was examined by real-time PCR.

The interleukin (IL)-17 producing (Th17) T helper cell subset induces EAE and plays an important role in different autoimmune diseases including MS. The differentiation of Th17 cells is regulated by the cytokines transforming growth factor (TGF)-&#x003b2; and IL-6, while IL-23 is essential for Th17 cell stabilization. In the context of autoimmune disorders IL-23 receptor (IL-23R) signaling controls the pathogenicity of Th17 cells <italic>in vivo</italic> and polymorphisms of IL-23R have been associated with different human autoimmune diseases.

A number of studies suggest that it occurs independently of inflammation. Our previous findings that activation of the complement system, part of innate immunity, accelerates neuroaxonal degeneration after nerve or brain trauma and the recent identification of the association between complement genetic variants and neurodegeneration in classical neurodegenerative diseases, led to our hypothesis that complement may also contribute to neuroaxonal pathology in MS.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To study localization and function of complement components and activation products in relation to neuropathology in MS.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> We analysed the localization of key complement components and regulators in post-mortem brainstem tissue from progressive multiple sclerosis donors, in relation to neuropathological changes, and compared the findings to brainstem tissue of donors with other neurological diseases or non-neurological controls. Complement function was tested <italic>in vitro</italic> using primary human astrocytes, and <italic>in vivo</italic> using mice with genetic or pharmacological inhibition of key complement components.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> We detected substantial deposition of complement activation products on neurons, axons, synapses and astrocytes in human brainstem. Neurons up-regulated stress markers; axons showed disturbed fast transport and lost synapses. Astrocytes were positive for pro-inflammatory cytokines. C1q and C3d were detected on neurons, axons and synapses, whereas the terminal activation product, membrane attack complex (MAC), co-localized on astrocytes positive for interleukin 1 beta (IL-1&#x003b2;) in lesions and induced pro-inflammatory cytokines in human primary astrocytes. Neurons were strongly positive for the complement regulatory protein CD59 but lost expression of CD55 within lesions. Further, using mice genetically deficient in CD55 or CD59a, we found that regulation of the terminal complement pathway is crucial to protect from MAC deposition on neurons, subsequent clinical disability and neuropathology in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model of MS. In addition, pharmacological inhibition of the MAC in wild-type mice prevented astrocyte activation and neuronal damage, suppressing clinical disease and pathology in EAE.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our findings indicate that complement activation occurs in MS grey matter and plays a key role in neurodegeneration in models and man.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section149-1352458514547846"><title>P564</title><sec id="section150-1352458514547846"><title>Intrathecal Epstein-Barr virus specific CD8 T-cell responses in multiple sclerosis patients are directed to lytic viral antigens</title><p><underline>GP van Nierop</underline><sup>1,2</sup>, JG Mitterreiter<sup>1</sup>, BL Haagmans<sup>1</sup>, J Mautner<sup>3</sup>, ADME Osterhaus<sup>1</sup>, RQ Hintzen<sup>2</sup>, GMGM Verjans<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Erasmus MC, Viroscience, Rotterdam, Netherlands, <sup>2</sup>Erasmus MC, ErasMS Centre at the Department of Neurology, Rotterdam, Netherlands, <sup>3</sup>Helmholtz-Zentrum, Clinical Cooperation Group, Pediatric Tumor Immunology, M&#x000fc;nchen, Germany</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection is a causative risk factor for MS.

The expression of IL-12a (p35), the specific target for miR-21, was significantly decreased in IFN-beta treated patients compared to healthy donors and untreated patients.

Recent studies indicate Th17 cells are not a uniform population and can be sub-divided into pathogenic and nonpathogenic Th17 cells in terms of EAE induction. Molecular signatures that differentiate pathogenic and nonpathogenic Th17 cells have been reported in a murine EAE model (Lee et al., 2012). In humans, IFN-g<sup>+</sup>IL-10<sup>-</sup> and IFN-g<sup>-</sup>IL-10<sup>+</sup> Th17 cells are induced in response to <italic>Candida albicans</italic> and <italic>Staphlococcus aureus</italic> infection, respectively, which possess different inflammatory capacity as well as factors that modulate their effector function (Zielinski et al., 2012). In MS, IFN-g<sup>+</sup> Th17 cells are preferentially recruited to the brain (Kebir et al, 2009).</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To transcriptionally compare the pathogenic and nonpathogenic molecular signatures of murine Th17 cells with various human Th17 cells.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Live IFN-g<sup>+</sup> Th17 (Th1Th17) and IFN-g<sup>-</sup> Th17 (Th17) cells were isolated from the peripheral blood of healthy donors and MS patients. Cell lysates of Th1Th17 and Th17 cells and RNA isolated from human IFN-g<sup>+</sup>IL-10<sup>-</sup> and IFN-g<sup>-</sup>IL-10<sup>+</sup> Th17 clones were analyzed with the nCounter Analysis System for gene expression profiling (nanoString Technologies) using CodeSet HuTh17 that encompasses a 419-gene expression detection panel specific for human T cell activation and differentiation.

In healthy donors, the proinflammatory Th1Th17 cells expressed higher levels of three major Th17 specific molecules including IL-23R, IL22 and RORC when compared to Th17 cells. In contrast, in untreated MS patients Th17 cells had acquired this proinflammatory module, which is normally very prominent only in Th1Th17 cells.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> These results provide new insights in defining the molecular signature of Th17 cells in MS that may modulate the pathogenicity of the cells.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section155-1352458514547846"><title>P567</title><sec id="section156-1352458514547846"><title>The immunological architecture of multiple sclerosis and treatment</title><p>J Dooley<sup>1,2</sup>, I Pauwels<sup>3</sup>, D Franckaert<sup>1,2</sup>, J Terbeek<sup>4</sup>, J Garcia-Perrez<sup>1,2</sup>, K Hilven<sup>3</sup>, D Danso-Abeam<sup>1,2</sup>, B Decallonne<sup>5</sup>, B Dubois<sup>3,4</sup>, A Liston<sup>1,2</sup>, <underline>A Goris</underline><sup>3</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>KU Leuven, Department of Immunology and Microbiology, Leuven, Belgium, <sup>2</sup>VIB, Leuven, Belgium, <sup>3</sup>KU Leuven, Department of Neurosciences, Leuven, Belgium, <sup>4</sup>University Hospitals, Leuven, Belgium, <sup>5</sup>KU Leuven, Department for Clinical and Experimental Endocrinology, Leuven, Belgium</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Genetic studies and animal models highlight the importance of the adaptive immune system in the development of multiple sclerosis.

CD26 is a marker of T cell activation and the expression of CD26 on CD4<sup>+</sup>T cells correlates with clinical and MRI disease activity in MS patients.

Diffusely-abnormal white matter (DAWM) exhibits a signal intensity intermediate between lesion and normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) and has an ill-defined boundary.

Regions of interest (ROIs) of lesion, DAWM and NAWM were mapped from MRI onto histology and 5 high-resolution (40x) fields were photographed per ROI.

Especially TH17 cells exhibit a strong proinflammatory phenotype, and have been shown to disrupt the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Using a proteomic approach, we previously revealed that TH17 cells express several members of the ephrin/Eph receptor tyrosine kinase system. Ephrins (EFNs) interact with their complementary receptors (Ephs) via cell-cell contact, and these complexes are involved in a variety of biological processes including neural development, vasculogenesis/angiogenesis and T cell regulation.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> In this study, we aimed at eludicating the role of the ephrin/Eph system in MS and its animal model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), specifically in the pathogenicity and migration potential of TH17 cells.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> To identify expression of ephrins and Ephs, we used qPCR and WB on RNA and protein fractions of differentiated TH1, TH2 and TH17 cells. TH17 cells were also allowed to migrate through a monolayer of human BBB endothelial cells (BBB-ECs), after stimulation of the EFNB2-EPHB4 interaction. Furthermore, RNA from <italic>ex vivo</italic> CD4 and CD8 cells was isolated from healthy donors and MS patients to identify differential expression of ephrins/Ephs. Immunohistofluorescence was used to determine expression of EFNB1 and EFNB2 in MS lesions.

Furthermore, stimulation of the EFNB2-EPHB4 interaction on human TH17 cells increases their migratory capacity through a monolayer of human BBB-ECs. We found EFNB1- and EFNB2-expressing infiltrating T cells in MS brain lesions, along with a striking upregulation of EFNB1 on astrocytes surrounding the infiltrate. Using a conditional dKO of EFNB1 and EFNB2 in TH cells, we found that clinical symptoms of EAE are significantly reduced. Further experiments revealed that this effect is due to decreased migration of TH cells (both TH1 and TH17) to the CNS, a reduced activation status of these cells and decreased demyelination.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Taken together, these results elucidate a crucial role for the EFN/EPH system in EAE and MS.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section183-1352458514547846"><title>P581</title><sec id="section184-1352458514547846"><title>Heterogeneous biological effect of AQP4-IgG on astrocyte</title><p><underline>E Nerrant</underline><sup>1</sup>, A Ruiz<sup>1</sup>, S Cavagna<sup>1</sup>, C Benetello<sup>2</sup>, N Auvergnon<sup>1</sup>, P Giraudon<sup>1</sup>, R Marignier<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Centre de Recherche en Neurosciences de Lyon (CRNL), Inserm U1028 - CNRS UMR5292 - UCBL, Lyon 1, Neuro-Oncology and Neuro-Inflammation Team (ONCOFLAM), Lyon, France, <sup>2</sup>CRNL, Plateforme G&#x000e9;n&#x000e9;tique Fonctionnelle et Optog&#x000e9;n&#x000e9;tique (PGFO), Lyon, France</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Neuromyelitis optica (NMO) is associated with a specific serum auto-antibody targeting aquaporin 4 (AQP4), a water channel expressed on astrocyte endfoot. AQP4 belongs to a membrane protein complex that includes potassium channel Kir4.1 and glutamate transporter EAAT2/GLT1. AQP4 auto-antibodies (AQP4-IgG) have a pathogenic role through complement-dependent toxicity leading to astrocyte death. We hypothesized that AQP4-IgG could also differentially modulate antigen density on astrocyte, triggering cell dysfunction, prior or in addition to the cytotoxic molecular cascade of complement.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> We aimed at identify the potential neuro-modulatory effect of AQP4-IgG on the behaviour of proteins involved in astrocyte function. We also evaluated the potential immuno-modulatory effect of AQP4-IgG by investigating the profile of chemokine-cytokine production by glial cells.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Mixed glial rat primary culture were treated for 24h with IgG purified from sera of 16 AQP4-IgG positive NMO patients and 8 healthy donors. Cell lysates were used for western blot and supernatant culture for cytokine secretion (Rat Cytokine Array Panel A, 29 molecules tested).</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> AQP4-IgG induced a neuro- and an immuno-modulatory effect on glial cells. AQP4-IgG from different patients diversely modulated the expression level and cell localization of AQP4, GFAP, Kir4.1, GLT1 and Connexin 43. Thus, the neuro-modulatory effect of AQP4-IgG, on astrocyte proteins that are crucial for cell homeostasis and functions, was heterogeneous. By contrast, AQP4-IgG from 8 acute NMO induced a common profile of cytokine and chemokine production by glial cells.

AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and peroxisome-proliferator activating receptor-&#x003b3; (PPAR-&#x003b3;), a transcription factor, were assessed by RT-PCR. Serum leptin was measured by ELISA, and secretion of IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, IL-17, IFN-g, and TNF-a by MBP- peptide specific-peripheral blood mononuclear cells was studied using ELISPOT.

IDO activity was measured applying the Kynurenin:Trp ratio, whereas ARG activity was assessed by colorimetric assay. IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, IL-17, IFN-g, and TNF-a secretion by MBP- peptide specific-peripheral blood mononuclear cells in culture was studied using ELISA. CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ regulatory T cell numbers were evaluated by flow cytometry.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> In 16 MS patients (80%), significant reduction in expression and activity of IDO1 and ARG1 was observed. However, IDO2, TDO, iNOS, and ARG2 expression and activity were similar in MS patients, patients with OIND and healthy controls. Trp and Arg depletion are sensed in T cells through a serine/threonine kinase GCN2-dependent mechanism. TLR9 stimulation of PBMCs from MS patients resulted in lack of GNC2 expression, and elevated levels of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), indicating high levels of Trp and Arg. mTOR is a crucial negative regulator of regulatory T cell de novo differentiation, and population expansion.

Several studies have demonstrated an effect of GA on T regulatory cells (Tregs), which are potent immunosuppressor cells pivotal in the maintenance of self-tolerance. However, the role of this cell population in the therapeutic effect of GA has not been clarified.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To elucidate the requirement for Tregs in the therapeutic activity of GA in the animal model of multiple sclerosis - experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE).</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Tregs were identified immunohistochemically in the CNS of mice that have recovered from EAE following GA treatment. The ability of GA to ameliorate EAE was tested in Foxp3GFPLuciDTR-4 transgenic mice, in which Tregs express diphtheria toxin (DT) receptor, thus facilitating their selective depletion by exposure to this toxin. GA (1mg/mouse) or PBS were injected daily for 7 days following EAE induction by the MOG 35-55 peptide. DT was injected one and two days after conclusion of GA/PBS treatment. Flow cytometry was used to verify Tregs depletion.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Immunohistological analysis revealed 2-fold elevation in the amount of CD3+Foxp3+ Tregs in the CNS of EAE-mice following GA treatment, compared to untreated EAE mice. GA treatment drastically reduced disease manifestation in wild type mice and its effect was not abrogated by DT injection (average maximal clinical score 0.5 in GA-treated compared to 2.9 in untreated mice). In mice carrying the Foxp3GFPLuciDTR-4 transgene and injected with DT, GA was less effective than in the wild type mice. Yet, even in these mice the clinical score of the GA-treated mice was lower than in the PBS-treated mice (1.6 and 3.0, respectively).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> GA treatment induces elevation of T-regulatory cells. Selective depletion of these Tregs reduces but does not eliminate the ability of GA to ameliorate EAE. These findings support the role of Tregs, but not in an exclusive fashion, in the therapeutic effect of GA.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section195-1352458514547846"><title>P587</title><sec id="section196-1352458514547846"><title>Impact of minocycline and established MS medications on EMMPRIN, a new factor implicated in MS immunopathogenesis</title><p><underline>JN Hahn</underline><sup>1</sup>, J Wang<sup>1</sup>, C Silva<sup>1</sup>, VW Yong<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>University of Calgary / Hotchkiss Brain Institute, Clinical Neurosciences, Calgary, AB, Canada</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an immune-mediated disease directed towards the central nervous system. EMMPRIN (CD147), known as a matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) inducer, is a novel factor in MS involved in multiple immunological functions in addition to trafficking of leukocytes across the blood-brain barrier. We reported EMMPRIN to be up-regulated in leukocytes in active lesions in MS and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) (Brain 136:1760, 2013). Furthermore, anti-EMMPRIN antibodies reduced the severity of EAE (J Neurosci 31:669, 2011).</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> We investigated whether emerging or established immunomodulators used in MS affect the expression of EMMPRIN on leukocytes. We focused on minocycline, an immunomodulator that we have reported to reduce the severity of EAE in mice (Brain 125:1297, 2002), and which decreased MRI activity in a pilot trial in relapsing-remitting MS (Ann Neurol 55:756, 2004; Can J Neurol Sci 35:185, 2008). Minocycline is currently in a Phase III trial in clinically isolated syndromes (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00666887).</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Mouse splenocytes and human PBMCs were pre-incubated with or without specific immunomodulators before polyclonal T cell activation (anti-CD3, anti-CD28) in culture. Cells were analyzed for viability and EMMPRIN expression by flow cytometry, and for proliferation by tritiated thymidine incorporation.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> EMMPRIN expression is increased upon T cell activation. Minocycline attenuated the up-regulation of EMMPRIN on activated T cells at concentrations as low as 0.5 &#x000b5;g/mL (p=0.009 compared to no drug), without obvious effects on cell viability and proliferation. At concentrations (5-10 &#x000b5;g/mL) of minocycline that are encountered in MS subjects on this medication, T cell expression of EMMPRIN along with proliferation and viability were lowered. Minocycline was more robust in reducing the mean fluorescence intensity of EMMPRIN, compared to percent cells with EMMPRIN.

Recently, in different works, some authors have reported that different environmental factors converge with a subset of genetic variants to dysregulate the N-Glycosylation pathways. N-glycan branching has been shown to be directly influenced by (1) metabolism and nutriment, (2) Vitamin D, a well described factor associated with MS and (3) IL-2 and IL-7 as critical regulators of N-Glycan branching. Finally, in the past years, some authors have clearly demonstrate the importance of the auto-antibodies directed against the glycosylated epitope of MOG, while others have reported the diagnostic value of anti-N-glucosylated peptide or antiGlc-Glc disaccharide antibodies. All these observations have pointed out that glycosylation may be implicated in MS pathological processes and that the deficiencies in glycosylation pathways may lead to autoreactivity against specific epitope or generate neo-epitope.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To test the global glycosylation pattern and its influence on autoreactivity</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> The glycosylation patterns were analyzed in MS but also in EAE using multiplexed proteomic approach with agglutinin labeling of glycoproteins.

We report two major alterations with regard to the sialylation and the branching glycosylation process of brain glycoproteins. In our study we observed an increase of the sialylation process concerning a large panel of different molecular weight glycoproteins. This phenomenon concerned both altered area as well as apparently normal brain tissue. Finally, we show that glycans alterations dramatically impact the antigenic properties of CNS glycoproteins and could explain dynamic changes of autoantibody repertoire in MS patients.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The results provide evidences for the implication of glycosylation in the MS pathophysiology and has potential diagnostic value.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section203-1352458514547846"><title>P591</title><sec id="section204-1352458514547846"><title>Cholesterol is main autoantigen recognized by antibodies reacting with brain lipids in MS patients</title><p><underline>A Jurewicz</underline><sup>1</sup>, M Domowicz<sup>1</sup>, A Ewiak-Paszynska<sup>1</sup>, G Galazka<sup>1</sup>, CS Raine<sup>2</sup>, K Selmaj<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Medical University of Lodz, Department of Neurology, Lodz, Poland, <sup>2</sup>Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Department of Pathology, New York, NY, United States</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Several autoantigens mainly proteins and peptides have been involved in autoimmune recognition in MS.

To assess the specificity of lipid binding by MS serum, purified IgG and IgM were digested with papain and pepsin and generated F(ab)<sub>2</sub> and F(ab) fragments showed high binding to lipid fractions but not Fc fragments. To further characterize lipids recognized by MS serum cholesterol, &#x003b2;2GP1, cardiolipin, phosphatidylinositol and galactocerebrosides were used as antigen in ELISA assays. Only cholesterol was found to bind IgG and IgM with high efficacy. Preabsorbtion of MS serum with cholesterol significantly decreased subsequent IgG and IgM recognition of lipid fractions by up 70% confirming specific cholesterol recognition by serum of MS patients.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> These results indicate that serum IgG and IgM from MS patients specifically recognize cholesterol and that anti-cholesterol antibodies are universally present in MS.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section205-1352458514547846"><title>P592</title><sec id="section206-1352458514547846"><title>Functional characterization of myeloid dendritic cells in peripheral blood of patients with multiple sclerosis</title><p><underline>B Wildemann</underline><sup>1</sup>, A Schwarz<sup>1</sup>, M Korporal-Kuhnke<sup>1</sup>, S Jarius<sup>1</sup>, J Haas<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>University of Heidelberg, Neurology, Heidelberg, Germany</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Naturally occurring regulatory T cells of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup>CD127<sup>low</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> phenotype (Treg) are important players in controlling immune and autoimmune responses. Treg are functionally defective in patients with MS and this dysfunction is related to a dysbalanced composition of na&#x000ef;ve and memory Treg subtypes in the systemic circulation. Several lines of evidence indicate that these abnormalities might result from premature decline in thymic dependent Treg neogenesis. Myeloid dendritic cells (mDCs) critically determine the differentiation of Treg in the thymus and the thymic stromal lymphopoietin receptor (TSLPR) expressed on the surface of mDC is a key component of signalling pathways involved in this process.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> We hypothesized that alterations of mDC contribute to the aberrant Treg homeostasis and function detectable in MS, and have therefore assessed phenotypes and functional activities of mDCs isolated from peripheral blood of patients with MS and age-matched healthy control donors.

However any involvement of c-Myc in the major T helper (Th) cell populations has not been investigated so far.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To analyze the role of c-Myc in Th cell development and function during autoimmune demyelination.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> We used conditional knockout mice (cKO) that lack c-Myc expression in T cells. In order to analyze the role of c-Myc in thymic T cell development we have generated mice in which c-Myc is conditionally deleted by the lck-cre transgene at the DN3 stage. To investigate the role of c-Myc in later stages of thymic development or function in the periphery, we generated mice in which c-Myc is conditionally deleted by the CD4-cre transgene.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> In lck-cre c-Myc cKO mice, T cell development is partially arrested, and only a few pre-T cells pass through the DN3 and DN4 checkpoint, mostly in the absence of cell division. In contrast, once past this critical developmental checkpoint, in CD4-cre c-Myc cKO mice further intrathymic development of mature CD4 and CD8 T cells appears to be independent of c-Myc. Both CD4 and CD8 subsets of peripheral T cells developed normally in CD4-cre c-Myc cKO. Furthermore, activation of peripheral T cells by T cell receptor stimulation resulted in normal upregulation of CD69 and downregulation of CD62L in c-Myc deficient as well as control mice. In contrast, profound inhibition of proliferation of c-Myc deficient peripheral T cells, in particular na&#x000ef;ve T helper cells, was observed. CD4-cre c-Myc cKO were also completely resistant, both clinically and histologically, to MS animal model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. This can be correlated with a specific loss of the Th17 population in c-Myc cKO mice.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our results demonstrate a previously unrecognized role of c-Myc in the development and differentiation of peripheral T helper cells with a particular role in the generation of Th17 cells and development of autoimmune demyelination.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section209-1352458514547846"><title>P594</title><sec id="section210-1352458514547846"><title>Global metabolomic analysis of cuprizone toxicity</title><p>A Taraboletti<sup>1</sup>, H Huang<sup>1</sup>, R Avila<sup>2</sup>, CB Bai<sup>2</sup>, S Medicetty<sup>2</sup>, <underline>L Shriver</underline><sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>University of Akron, Akron, OH, United States, <sup>2</sup>Renovo Neural Inc., Cleveland, OH, United States</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> The cuprizone model of toxic demyelination is widely used to study oligodendrocyte pathology and test new remyelinating therapies.

Though the role of CD4+ T cells in MS pathogenesis has been clearly established, much less is known about the role of CD8+ T cells or iNKT or about their polyfunctionality. The use of PCA strongly suggests that the role of these cells deserves further studies.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section213-1352458514547846"><title>P596</title><sec id="section214-1352458514547846"><title>Autoantibodies to IL-18 in multiple sclerosis: profit or damage?</title><p><underline>DS Korobko</underline><sup>1,2</sup>, MA Tyumentseva<sup>3</sup>, NA Malkova<sup>1,2</sup>, NV Tikunova<sup>3</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>State Novosibirsk Regional Clinical Hospital, Regional MS Centre, Novosibirsk, Russian Federation, <sup>2</sup>Novosibirsk State Medical University, Novosibirsk, Russian Federation, <sup>3</sup>Institute of Chemical Biology and Fundamental Medicine, SB of Russian Academy of Sciences, Novosibirsk, Russian Federation</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> The level of cytokines and anti-cytokine autoantibodies (auto-Abs) can considerably vary during autoimmune diseases.

Transfer of NaCl-conditioned macrophages into EAE-diseased animals resulted in a significant aggravation of disease severity when compared to transfer of untreated macrophages, thus underlining the pathophysiological relevance of NaCl for macrophage activation in the context of EAE.

Lymphocyte egress from lymphoid tissue into the blood is mediated by sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) and S1P-receptors (S1PR). Five types of S1PR (S1PR1-5) are known in humans. Only S1PR1 induces the emigration of B cells out of lymphoid organs.</p><p>Proinflammatory cytokines like interferons (IFN) can promote lymphocyte retention in lymphoid tissue by downmodulation of S1PR1. Although IFN-&#x003b2; has been used successfully in the treatment of MS patients for more than twenty years, the exact mode of action still remains unclear.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> Aim of this study was to assess the effect of IFN-&#x003b2;-1b treatment on the S1P-dependent lymphocyte circulation in MS patients as a possible mode of action.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Using flow cytometry, subpopulations of circulating B cells were analyzed in three groups: treatment na&#x000ef;ve MS patients, MS patients under at least six months of IFN-&#x003b2;-1b treatment and healthy donors (HD). Additionally, S1P-dependent B cell migration in these groups was assessed with in-vitro transwell migration assays.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> 30 MS patients (15 treatment na&#x000ef;ve, 15 under IFN) and 30 HD were analyzed. Lymphocyte subpopulations of treatment na&#x000ef;ve patients resembled those of HD. IFN treatment led to significant changes in lymphocyte subpopulations: reduced memory B cells and marginal zone (MZ) B cells, but increased transitional and na&#x000ef;ve B cells.</p><p>Treatment na&#x000ef;ve MS patients revealed an impaired S1P-dependent migration of different B cell subtypes compared to HC, which normalized under IFN.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The reduction of MZ and potentially autoreactive memory B cells under IFN treatment could be explained through preferential differentiation into short-lived plasmablasts and consequent exhaustion. In compensation, more immature B cells are released from the bone marrow into circulation. This renewal of the B cell compartment could contribute to an alleviation of B cell-mediated autoreactive inflammation in MS.</p><p>The impaired S1P-dependent migration of B cells in treatment na&#x000ef;ve MS patients should be confirmed in future studies with bigger sample sizes. That S1P-dependent migration improved under IFN treatment was surprising and should stimulate further research.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section227-1352458514547846"><title>P603</title><sec id="section228-1352458514547846"><title>Natalizumab and fingolimod differentially impact the alpha-4/beta-1 and alpha-L/beta-2 expression-related subset diversity of T-cells</title><p><underline>A Harrer</underline><sup>1</sup>, K Oppermann<sup>1</sup>, J Wanek<sup>1</sup>, G Pilz<sup>1</sup>, P Wipfler<sup>1</sup>, J Sellner<sup>1</sup>, S Afazel<sup>2</sup>, E Haschke-Becher<sup>2</sup>, E Trinka<sup>1</sup>, J Kraus<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Paracelsus Medical University, Department of Neurology, Salzburg, Austria, <sup>2</sup>Paracelsus Medical University, Central Laboratory, Salzburg, Austria</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> The alpha-4/beta-1 (&#x003b1;4/&#x000df;1; VLA-4) and alpha-L/beta-2 (&#x003b1;L/&#x000df;2; LFA-1) integrins are crucially involved in the migration of immune cells into the central nervous system. Natalizumab (NZB) and fingolimod (FTY) are two efficacious treatment options in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS).

It is well established that GA among other effects induces a shift in the cytokine profile of T-cells, but the molecular mechanisms involved remain largely unknown.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> By investigating the protein profile of human GA and myelin basic protein (MBP) specific CD4+ T cells, we aimed to find single, Ag-specific expressed proteins that may be involved in regulatory processes of the immune system in MS.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> We generated GA and MBP specific T cell lines (TCL) from healthy donors and from MS patients before and after 6 months of GA therapy. Proteomic analysis of activated and resting GA and MBP specific T cells was done by SDS-PAGE gel-electrophoresis and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Additionally a high throughput human cytokine/chemokine magnetic bead assay was applied to supernatants of human PBMC cultured with protein candidates, to reveal potentially immunomodulatory effects on immune cells.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> 51 gel spots were identified as different proteins by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Further analysis of these proteins by pathway software led us to prohibitin - a protein with anti-apoptotic, anti-proliferative and anti-inflammatory properties upregulated only during GA therapy. Other protein candidates (e. g. transgelin 2) were only found upregulated in GA specific T cells, but not in MBP specific TCL. One protein with prominent proinflammatory properties was detected with significant elevation only in MBP specific TCL compared to GA specific T cells. Further analysis via high throughput assays suggested a regulation of cytokines and chemokines by transgelin.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our results indicate that proteomics are a valuable tool to detect differences in protein regulation among specific TCL in MS. Preliminary results with transgelin indicate so far unknown cytokine / chemokine interactions. Based on their expression and cytokine interaction profile, these proteins may be involved in immunological mechanisms operating in MS and/or during GA treatment.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section231-1352458514547846"><title>P605</title><sec id="section232-1352458514547846"><title>Short term effects of intravenous glucocorticoids on the expression of Th17-related genes on circulating CD4+ T-cells after multiple sclerosis relapse</title><p>C de Andres<sup>1,2</sup>, MI Garcia<sup>2</sup>, A Delgado<sup>2</sup>, H Goicoechea<sup>1,2</sup>, ML Martinez-Gines<sup>1,2</sup>, ML Martin<sup>1,2</sup>, <underline>LA Lopez-Fernandez</underline><sup>2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Hospital Gregorio Mara&#x000f1;on, Madrid, Spain, <sup>2</sup>Biomedical Research Institute Gregorio Mara&#x000f1;on, Madrid, Spain</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> CD4+Th17 cells may be the predominant effect of T cell population in the Central Nervous System (CNS) in multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions.

We use an algorithm that incorporates validated genetic and environmental risk factors into a single estimate of a subject&#x02019;s risk of developing MS. We aim to recruit 5000 subjects and capture the transition from health to MS during the 20-year follow-up period. The traditional recruitment methods, relying on simple online advertising, clinic referrals, and mailings, were inefficient (100 participants enrolled in 12 months).</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To investigate the efficacy of social media as a recruitment tool.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> We developed a facebook page and contacted organizations that targeted our subject population: having FDR with MS. We composed facebook and Twitter friendly posts that these organizations could share on their individual pages and websites to promote our study, particularly the National Multiple Sclerosis Society (NMSS).

The GEMS facebook page has 1363 followers: 1223 live within the United States. The average viewership of each GEMS facebook posting by unique individuals was 182 during the first year after the launch of the site, 320 during the second year, and 497 in the current third year. 82% of GEMS facebook followers are female (compared to 46% of total facebook users who are female).

The number of social medial platforms and their use is increasing, with more time spent on social media sites than any other type of site. Individuals affected by multiple sclerosis (MS) and MS related organisations use social media to discuss the disease, but the extent and nature of the use of social media in MS is not known.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To determine the global use of social media in relation to MS over time.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> The social media web analytics tool TopsyPro was used to retrospectively analyse all &#x0201c;tweets&#x0201d; (messages of up to 140 characters) sent on the social networking site Twitter since its launch in March 2006. Search terms and hashtags related to MS generally, chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency (CCSVI), MS research, MS treatments and MS risk factors were identified using hashtagify.me, and analysed for the volume, frequency, sentiment, influence and acceleration of tweets over time. Similarly, social media analytics tool DataSift was used to perform historical and real-time social data analysis across social media platforms including Tumblr, Blogger and public Facebook data. Where peaks of use of social media were identified, Google Trends was used to identify corresponding news stories and evaluate how these influence social media discussion of MS.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Three search terms related to MS generally alone generated a total of 1,680,783 tweets from Mar 2006-Apr 2014. Tweets about MS are rapidly accelerating in frequency with 46% more tweets in Jan-Dec 2013 compared to Jan-Dec 2012. The sentiment of tweets is generally positive with 64% of tweets terms more positive than all other tweets sent in the same time frame. Five terms related to CCSVI were searched for tweets. A total of 61,808 tweets were identified which peaked April-May 2011 (3,314 tweets) following the announcement that $5 million would be spent in Manitoba on CCSVI trials. News stories, particularly when related to, or promoted by, celebrities were found to be particularly influential in social media use.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Social media platforms are widely, and increasingly, used to discuss MS and are an important source of information for individuals affected by MS. The use of social media is an invaluable and necessary opportunity for healthcare professionals to address misconceptions, sensationalist news stories and engage with the public. Further work should aim to advise professionals in MS on how this is effectively done.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section238-1352458514547846"><title>P608</title><sec id="section239-1352458514547846"><title>Social media and MS: a crowdsourcing-based approach</title><p><underline>L Lavorgna</underline><sup>1</sup>, M de Stefano<sup>1</sup>, D Buonanno<sup>1</sup>, S Eboli<sup>2</sup>, F Conte<sup>1</sup>, A Gallo<sup>1</sup>, S Bonavita<sup>1</sup>, G Tedeschi<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Second University of Naples, Department of Medical, Surgical, Neurological, Metabolic and Aging Sciences, Naples, Italy, <sup>2</sup><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Monchibord.com">Monchibord.com</ext-link>, Naples, Italy</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Internet is full of blogs and websites about MS where users can post any information that may acquire assertive and not debatable importance even without citing scientific or medical references.

Originally from creating a blog on June 2013 this came at a social network workshops organized for patients, families and other people with an interest in MS with more active participation in the different levels of health through questions, online surveys and reviews. Surveys: physical/work or therapy access, sleep diseases, nutrition/dietary, sexual dysfunction. The blog is fully in Spanish with Google translator.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> After 10 months from launch, the blog had 5500 visits till now among ARG: 1337: USA:1253; Spain:1251; Latam:372 and rest of the world:1287. Explorer %: Chrome 39; Firefox 18; Mobile Safari 16. Online Surveys: 213 responders; gender F/M (%): 62 /38; mean age: 43.6 &#x000b1; 10.9.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> SM is a facilitator for the exercise of the medical profession, increases interaction with our peers and access to better information for professionals and patients, both social and emotional support, although we must be careful in the quality of information and data confidentiality. Finally, we must recognize and analyse the changes that have been taking the patient-physician relationship, not to mention that they should remain the essence and purpose of our profession.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="section244-1352458514547846"><title>Microbiome</title><sec id="section245-1352458514547846"><title>P611</title><sec id="section246-1352458514547846"><title>Regulation of CNS demyelination by the gut microbiome</title><p><underline>LH Kasper</underline><sup>1</sup>, Y Wang<sup>1</sup>, K Telesford<sup>1</sup>, S Haque-Begum<sup>1</sup>, EJ Kasper<sup>1</sup>, J Ochoa-Reparaz<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Geisel School of Medicine Dartmouth College, Microbiology &#x00026; Immunology, Hanover, NH, United States</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> The host gut/symbiont microflora interaction or gut microbiome provide essential support by processing nutrients, controlling infections, and development of the immune system. Mounting evidence demonstrates the importance of the gut microbiome in a variety of experimental conditions including autoimmunity. Environmental factors such as antibiotic exposure, vaccination, diet and stress have been associated with a microfloral alteration or dysbiosis within the GI tract that lead to a disease state. We have assessed the capacity of current and novel therapies to influence immune regulation via the gut microbiome. Our lab first reported on the essential role of gut symbionts in the immune mediated regulation of EAE. We have identified a polysaccharide (PSA) produced by the human symbiont <italic>B. fragilis</italic> as a potent immunomodulator that protects in different models of EAE when administered orally, prophylactic and therapeutically. To date, this is the only purified symbiont product known to effectively protect against CNS inflammation.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To determine the mechanisms by which current and novel gut microbiome-related therapies can mediate regulatory responses against EAE and human MS.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> In vivo and <italic>in vitro</italic> culture systems were used to assay for murine gut associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) responses in EAE as well as human PBMC responses to commensal derived antigen and other IMD utilized in the treatment of human MS</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Our studies demonstrate the capacity of commensal agents and IMD to modulate the phenotype and functional regulation of specific immune cell compartments in both EAE and human PBMC. We have observed potent IL-10 responses elicited by regulatory CD4+ T cells that express enhanced levels of Foxp3 and CD39. The commensal microflora driven regulatory cells are essential to host protection against the experimental disease state. <italic>In vitro</italic> analysis of human PBMCs exposed to commensal antigen demonstrates a dose-dependent increase in IL-10-producing Tregs, and concomitant reduction of TNF-a. Antigen presentation by PSA was essential in the acquisition of this regulatory/IL-10 phenotype when compared with healthy donors.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> These are the first reported findings that correlate the protection induced by a purified symbiont product in EAE with the promotion of a regulatory T cell phenotype in humans. These findings provide <italic>in vivo</italic>/<italic>vitro</italic> data that support a novel mechanistic paradigm by which commensal products and IMD can establish GALT mediated protection in CNS demyelination.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section247-1352458514547846"><title>P612</title><sec id="section248-1352458514547846"><title>Intestinal microflora modified by Candida kefyr reduces the susceptibility to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis</title><p><underline>K Takata</underline><sup>1</sup>, T Tomita<sup>2</sup>, T Koda<sup>1</sup>, T Okuno<sup>1</sup>, JA Honorat<sup>1</sup>, M Kinoshita<sup>3</sup>, M Takei<sup>2</sup>, K Hagihara<sup>2</sup>, H Mochizuki<sup>1</sup>, S Sakoda<sup>4</sup>, Y Nakatsuji<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Osaka University, Neurology, Suita, Japan, <sup>2</sup>Kyorin Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Shimotsuga, Japan, <sup>3</sup>Osaka University, Laboratory of Immune Regulation, Suita, Japan, <sup>4</sup>National Hospital Organization Toneyama, Neurology, Toyonaka, Japan</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Diet is recently drawn attention as a potential risk factor of developing autoimmune diseases. Especially, the rapid increase in MS incidence in Japan seems to be attributed to a change of dietary habit. Although several dietary risks and benefits of probiotics have been suggested in animal models, little is known about the effects of dietary yeast on health.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> The aim of our study is to examine the effects of dietary yeast on experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE).</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> We chose 11 kinds of yeast which are contained in diet, then investigated the effects on EAE by oral administration. CD4-positive T cells in intestinal lamina propria and mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) were analysed by FACS, and cytokine production from explants of intestine was assessed. The effects of Candida kefyr (C. kefyr) to intestinal microflora were analyzed by T-RFLP analysis of feces. Microflora transfer was performed by oral administration of diluted cecal contents after treatment with antibiotics cocktail.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> In yeast we examined, only C. kefyr exhibited significant clinical amelioration of EAE and the antigen-specific production of IFN-gamma and IL-17 by inguinal lymph nodes was decreased.

The number of CD4-positive IL-17-producing cells was reduced in intestinal lamina propria. Intestinal tissue explant culture revealed that production of IL-6 was significantly suppressed in C. kefyr-treated group.

Traditionally, experimental studies have focused on understanding the activity of IL-17-producing T cells which differentiate from na&#x000ef;ve T cells in the peripheral immune system. However, we have previously demonstrated that IL-17-producing T cells are also present in the thymus of na&#x000ef;ve wild-type mice and can be co-activated there by microbial stimuli. Other studies have supported the concept that IL-17-producing thymocytes have a specific role in the immediate defense against microbial pathogens, which is independent from the development of an adaptive immune response.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> Given a strong importance of the thymus in systemic bacterial infection and sepsis, we here investigate the effect of a broad spectrum of bacteria and cell wall components on thymocyte cytokine production.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Cytokine production of thymocytes was assessed with ELISPOT and with intracellular FACS analysis</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Surprisingly, we find that all types of bacteria investigated (including non-pathogenic species) uniformly activate IL-17-producing thymocytes upon &#x003b1;-CD3 stimulation. In contrast, there is a heterogeneous effect on IL-6 and IFN-gamma-production with Gram-negative bacteria inducing far higher frequencies of IL-6- and IFN-gamma-producing thymocytes than Gram-positive bacteria.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> We conclude that IL-17-producing thymocytes constitute a &#x0201c;first line of recognition&#x0201d;, but not a &#x0201c;first line of defense&#x0201d; against bacteria in general. Their activity might lead to immune activation, but not necessarily to a pathological inflammatory disease condition. The difference between these two states might be determined by other immunological effector molecules like IL-6 and IFN-gamma.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section251-1352458514547846"><title>P614</title><sec id="section252-1352458514547846"><title>A commensal symbiont product prevents murine CNS demyelination via TLR2-mediated expansion of migratory CD39+ T-cell subsets</title><p><underline>Y Wang</underline><sup>1</sup>, K Telesford<sup>1</sup>, S Begum-Haque<sup>1</sup>, J Ochoa-Rep&#x000e1;raz<sup>1,2</sup>, M Christy<sup>3</sup>, DL Kasper<sup>4</sup>, LH Kasper<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Dartmouth College, Departments of Microbiology and Immunology, Lebanon, NH, United States, <sup>2</sup>University of California, Santa Barbara, Sanford/Burnham Medical Research Institute, Santa Barbara, CA, United States, <sup>3</sup>Rutgers University, Newark, NH, United States, <sup>4</sup>Harvard University, Departments of Microbiology and Immunology, Boston, MA, United States</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Our recent research on the link between gut microbiome and immune- mediated CNS demyelination has shed light on human multiple sclerosis etiology and clinical utilization of microbiota products. We have reported that polysaccharide A (PSA), a product of the gut symbiont strain <italic>Bacteroides fragilis</italic>, protects against murine experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) via TLR2 both prophylactically and therapeutically. TLR2 signaling is critical for PSA-mediated suppression of CNS inflammation and anatomically localized expansion of CD39<sup>+</sup>CD4 T cells. CD39<sup>+</sup>CD4 T cells express enhanced migratory markers and display increased migratory capacity both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Deficiency of CD39 signaling compromises PSA protection of EAE, which is correlated by a reciprocal up- and down-regulation of CNS-infiltrating total leukocytes and Tregs.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> We investigate how <italic>B. fragilis</italic> PSA functions to poise immune balance during CNS autoimmunity.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> We assessed the capacity of PSA to prevent EAE and modulate CD4 T cell phenotypes. EAE was induced in WT and TLR2<sup>-/-</sup> mice orally treated with purified PSA or PBS. Clinic scores were compared up to day 25. Histological assays were used to visualize CNS immune infiltrates and demyelination. Peak disease state CNS tissues were analyzed for the expression of inflammatory molecules by RT-PCR. FACS was used to measure CD39 level on CD4 T cells at various sites, and to profile migratory markers of CD39<sup>+</sup> versus CD39<sup>-</sup> T cell subsets. Immune infiltrates into the CNS were compared in PSA or PBS treated WT EAE mice. Finally, CD39<sup>-/-</sup> mice were compared with WT in PSA protection of EAE development.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> PSA significantly reduced murine EAE severity, restricted total leukocyte infiltration and demyelination in the CNS. PSA suppressed inflammatory cytokines and chemokines but reciprocally boosted CD39 signals in the disease-state CNS. Ablation of TLR2 negated the protective function of PSA. PSA preferentially expanded CD39<sup>+</sup>CD4 T cells at CLN and MLN during EAE. CD39<sup>+</sup>, as opposed to CD39<sup>-</sup> total CD4 T cells and Treg subsets, exhibited elevated level of CCR5, CCR6 and CXCR3. PSA protection of EAE and expansion of Tregs in the CNS were compromised in the absence of CD39.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our results indicate that commensal products could limit CNS autoimmunity and enhance the tropism of regulatory CD39<sup>+</sup> T cell subsets. TLR2 recognition of microbiome could establish tolerogenic immune responses toward systemic inflammation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section253-1352458514547846"><title>P615</title><sec id="section254-1352458514547846"><title>Gut microbiome in early pediatric multiple sclerosis: a case-control study</title><p><underline>H Tremlett</underline><sup>1</sup>, D Fadrosh<sup>2</sup>, S Lynch<sup>2</sup>, J Hart<sup>2</sup>, J Graves<sup>2</sup>, S Lulu<sup>2</sup>, G Aaen<sup>3</sup>, A Belman<sup>4</sup>, L Benson<sup>5</sup>, C Casper<sup>6</sup>, T Chitnis<sup>5</sup>, M Gorman<sup>5</sup>, L Krupp<sup>4</sup>, TE Lotze<sup>7</sup>, J Ness<sup>8</sup>, S Roalstad<sup>6</sup>, M Rodgriguez<sup>9</sup>, J Rose<sup>6</sup>, J-M Tillema<sup>9</sup>, B Weinstock-Guttman<sup>10</sup>, E Waubant<sup>2</sup>, US Network of Pediatric MS Centers</p><p><sup>1</sup>University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada, <sup>2</sup>University of California, San Francisco, CA, United States, <sup>3</sup>Loma Linda University, Loma Linda, CA, United States, <sup>4</sup>Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY, United States, <sup>5</sup>Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, United States, <sup>6</sup>University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, United States, <sup>7</sup>Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, United States, <sup>8</sup>University of Alabama, Birmingham, AL, United States, <sup>9</sup>Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, United States, <sup>10</sup>State University of New York at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY, United States</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Alterations in the gut microbiome may be influential in neurological disease.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> We explored gut microbiome profiles in early pediatric MS and age and sex matched controls.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Children aged 18 years or under attending a University of California, San Francisco pediatric clinic were invited to participate in a genetic and environmental risk factors study (NS071463, PI Waubant). MS cases were within 2 years of symptom onset. Controls were free from autoimmune disorders (asthma and eczema allowed), with neither parent affected by MS or related disorders. The child&#x02019;s first stool of the day was shipped on ice to the laboratory and stored at -80C. The 16S rRNA gene was amplified from extracted DNA and bacterial profiles were generated using the PhyloChip G3 microarray (Second Genome, Inc., CA). Associations between the pediatric characteristics and variation in the bacterial community composition were assessed using nonmetric multidimensional scaling and permutational multivariate analysis of variance with distance matrices (Adonis function in the vegan R package).</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Between Nov/2011-Nov/2013, 20 MS (10 girls, 10 boys) and 16 controls (9 girls, 7 boys) provided stool samples for microbiome analysis. The mean age at collection was 13.2 years (SD=3.84; range 4-18) and 19/36 (14 cases, 5 controls) identified as non-white. Within two months pre-stool collection, 3 children (2 cases, 1 control) were exposed to an antibiotic, 10 (8 cases, 2 controls) to a corticosteroid and within three months, 12 to an immuno-modulatory or -suppressant drug (10 cases, 2 controls). For cases, the mean disease duration at stool collection was 11 months (range 2-24), the median EDSS at enrollment was 2.0 (range 0-4.0); all met McDonald criteria and had relapsing-remitting MS. Preliminary microbiome results indicated significant differences in community composition between cases and controls, with enrichment of Proteobacteria (<italic>Shigella, Escherichia</italic>) and Firmicutes (<italic>Clostridium</italic>) and depletion of Firmicutes (<italic>Eubacterium rectale</italic>) and Actinobacteria (<italic>Corynebacterium</italic>) observed in MS (all p&#x0003c; 0.01; false discovery rate, q&#x0003c; 0.217).

The gut microbiome has been described in other diseases but not yet in MS.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To determine if there are differences in the gut microbiome in MS and if gut microbiome could be linked to immune cell phenotype in MS.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> MS patients from the Partners MS Center [untreated (n=22), glatiramer acetate treated (n=13), and IFN-&#x003b2; treated (n=18)] and healthy controls from the BWH PhenoGenetic project (n=44) were studied. Samples were profiled using two high throughput platforms (454 and Illumina 16s sequencing) to determine community structure and taxonomic composition of the gut microbome. The gut microbiome was also linked to immune cell profiling in peripheral blood using flow based and nanostring based assays.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> We found an increase in Archaea (Methanobrevi-bacteriaceae) in MS vs. controls (p &#x0003c; 0.00001 by 454 sequencing). Archaea are in a kingdom separate from bacteria and eukaryotes and in the human gut are dominated by Methanobrevibacter smithii, which make up 10% of colonic anaerobes in the gut. We also found two organisms with anti-inflammatory properties that were lower in MS vs. controls and which were increased with treatment. Specifically: 1) The Butyricimonas genus from Bacteroidetes phylum was lower in the untreated MS vs. controls. Butyricimonas are butyrate producers with anti-inflammatory effects; and 2) The Lachnospiraceae family from the Firmicutes phylum (which are also butyrate producers) was lower in untreated vs. treated MS irrespective of whether they were treated with IFN-&#x003b2; or glatiramer acetate. Immune cell analysis showed that the antigen presenting cells from MS patients have an activated phenotype that could be linked to presence or absence of Archaea. In addition, we found that the expression of T cell specific markers such as IFN-gamma, a proinflammatory cytokine associated with MS, is also linked to the presence or absence of Archaea.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our results identify changes in both pro-and anti-inflammatory epigenetic factors in the gut microbiome of MS subjects that may contribute to disease pathogenesis and that could be linked to changes in immune cell phenotype.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section257-1352458514547846"><title>P617</title><sec id="section258-1352458514547846"><title>Commensal antigen induction of suppressive human Foxp3+ Tregs</title><p><underline>KM Telesford</underline><sup>1</sup>, Y Wang<sup>1</sup>, J Ochoa-Rep&#x000e1;raz<sup>1</sup>, S Begum-Haque<sup>1</sup>, LH Kasper<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, Microbiology &#x00026; Immunology, Hanover, NH, United States</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Our GI tract harbors billions of microbial agents representing thousands of species. The interaction between the microflora and the host, or microbiome, boasts profound clinically relevant immunogenic potential. Our published studies in EAE demonstrate that the human commensal Bacteroides fragilis can generate IL-10 producing Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) that are protective in both EAE and experimental IBD. Preliminary <italic>in vitro</italic> studies using human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) reveal the capacity of a single capsular polysaccharide (PSA) derived from B. fragilis to generate activated IL-10-secreting T cells of a regulatory phenotype that appears independent of Foxp3 co-expression.

When the balance that normally exists in the gut microbiota is altered (dysbiosis), a number of diseases may result. Recent studies have related gut dysbiosis with development or severity of Crohn&#x02019;s disease, type I diabetes, obesity and autism.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To develop a multi-Center academic consortium that designs and implements a translational framework to evaluate the effect of gut dysbiosis in MS. Our goals include elucidating the role of gut microbiota in the different MS clinical phenotypes and response to disease modifying therapies (DMT) as well as to evaluate disease causality using animal models.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> The MSMC is an IRB-sanctioned, multi-disciplinary collaboration composed of two translational and dedicated MS Centers (Mt Sinai and UCSF), and a microbiome-oriented basic/experimental program and sequencing/bioinformatics Core. The MSMC has collected hundreds of samples and is currently analyzing their gut microbiomes by 16S bacterial DNA by massively parallel sequencing. The analysis is primarily conducted using the QIIME pipeline and aims at identifying group differences at the genus-level.

Our initial results show significant genus-level differences in the microbiomes of patients treated with glatiramer acetate compared to untreated subjects.

Confocal immunofluorescent microscopy was used for qualitative analyses. Quantifications were performed using a fluorescent plate reader.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Uptake of myelin debris by astrocytes was mediated by the cell surface scavenger receptor low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (<italic>LRP1</italic>) through endocytosis in a time- and concentration dependent manner. Activation of astrocytes with TNF&#x003b1; or IFN&#x003b3; but not with LPS further increased myelin endocytosis. Myelin uptake was significantly reduced by a competitive LRP1-ligand, dynamin inhibition and by Fingolimod, a sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor modulator. Myelin vesicles co-localized with LRP1, early endosomes and lysosomes suggesting intracellular trafficking through the endosomal-lysosomal pathway. Astroglial myelin uptake induced elevated astroglial expression of GFAP and reactive oxygen species. Moreover, increased activation and migration of microglia cells was observed after incubation with supernatant of myelin-laden astrocytes. Finally, co-culture of myelin-laden astrocytes with hippocampal neurons caused significant loss of neuronal dendrites.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our data indicate that astrocytes ingest myelin debris by LRP1-mediated endocytosis. Myelin uptake results in activation of astrocytes and ROS production, recruitment of microglia and loss of dendrites in neurons but not neuronal cell death.</p><p>These findings provide further evidence that astrocytes actively participate in lesion development and may therefore constitute a therapeutic target for MS treatment.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section264-1352458514547846"><title>P620</title><sec id="section265-1352458514547846"><title>Expression profiles of inflammation associated microRNAs in astrocytes from multiple sclerosis lesions</title><p><underline>VTS Rao</underline><sup>1</sup>, SC Fuh<sup>1</sup>, CS Moore<sup>1</sup>, SK Ludwin<sup>2</sup>, M-K Ho<sup>1</sup>, BJ Bedell<sup>1</sup>, A Bar-Or<sup>1</sup>, JP Antel<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada, <sup>2</sup>Queen&#x02019;s University, Kingston, ON, Canada</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Astrocytes participate in both tissue injury and repair processes in the CNS.

Studies of human fetal astrocytes <italic>in vitro</italic>, demonstrate that miR-146a is an inflammation-resolving miRNA, which targets interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase-1 (IRAK-1) mRNA; miR-155 is a pro-inflammatory molecule that targets suppressor of cytokine signaling -1 (SOCS-1) mRNA. <italic>In vitro</italic>, IL-1&#x003b2; increases expression of both miR-146a and miR-155. <italic>In situ</italic>, these miRNAs are increased in active MS lesion samples.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To assess expression of inflammation-related miRNAs in astrocytes derived from active MS lesions and compare levels of expression in cases of ischemic lesions and controls (cases without CNS disease).</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Using laser capture microdissection (LCM), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) immunostained astrocytes were captured from formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) human brain tissue samples. Total RNA was extracted from captured cells and reverse transcribed (RT) in multiplexed reactions. Pre-amplification PCR (polymerase chain reaction) was performed on cDNAs before using them as templates in final quantitative PCR (qPCR).</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> MiR-146a was down regulated overall in astrocytes derived from MS lesions as compared to control samples and was lower in astrocytes within MS lesions compared to those distant from the lesion site. MiR-146a was also down regulated in astrocytes captured from both grey and white matter regions of ischemic lesions compared to controls. In MS lesions, miR-155 expression levels in astrocytes were comparable to those from control tissues. Previously, we have observed that miR-155 expression was increased in myeloid cells in MS lesions compared to control tissues (Moore et al, 2013). MiR-155 expression levels did not differ between astrocytes from ischemia cases and normal controls, in either grey or white matter regions.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Defining distinct cell type specific expression profiles of miRNAs in human glial cells enhances our understanding of their contributions to mechanisms related to injury and repair in MS.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section266-1352458514547846"><title>P621</title><sec id="section267-1352458514547846"><title>Histamine H3 receptor negatively regulates oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination</title><p><underline>RR Wang</underline><sup>1</sup>, Y Chen<sup>1</sup>, T Guo<sup>1</sup>, W Zhen<sup>1</sup>, TB Guo<sup>1</sup>, RY Zhao<sup>1</sup>, AA Liu<sup>1</sup>, JP Rubio<sup>2</sup>, D Krull<sup>3</sup>, J Lu<sup>1</sup>, M Song<sup>1</sup>, P Thompson<sup>1</sup>, S Wang<sup>1</sup>, JC Richardson<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>GlaxoSmithKline, R&#x00026;D in Shanghai, Shanghai, China, <sup>2</sup>GlaxoSmithKline, R&#x00026;D Center, Stevenage, United Kingdom, <sup>3</sup>GlaxoSmithKline, R&#x00026;D Center, Research Triangle Park, NC, United States</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> A huge unmet medical need exists in development of new treatment paradigms to repair myelin in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS).

Further testing of additional structurally-diverse H3R modulators revealed that only inverse agonists but not neutral antagonists promoted oligodendrocyte differentiation and cerebellar slice myelination, which implied a key role of the constitutive activity of H3R. H3R was expressed in all stages of oligodendrocyte differentiation, and siRNA knock-down of H3R expression to ~40% of normal levels enhanced the expression of MBP and myelin associated glycoprotein (MAG), markers for mature oligodendrocytes. Furthermore, systemic administration of a brain-penetrable H3R inverse agonist, GSK247246 enhanced remyelination in the mouse cuprizone model. These data support that the constitutive activity of H3R negatively regulates oligodendrocyte differentiation. In humans, we detected oligodendroglial H3R expression in demyelinated MS lesions and observed genetic association between an exonic single nucleotide polymorphism in <italic>HRH3</italic> and susceptibility to MS (p=0.006, OR=1.22).

Proliferation and differentiation were characterized using specific antibodies (to bromodeoxyuridine, A2B5, CNP, MBP, GFAP), and compared to untreated control cultures.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> NFL-TBS.40-63 significantly increased OL differentiation and maturation with more CNP+ and MBP+ cells characterized by numerous ramified processes, and putative myelin balls, whereas NFL-SCR2 was ineffective. The proliferation of OL progenitors was not affected, nor was AS proliferation and differentiation. Lysophosphatidyl choline (LPC, 2. 10<sup>-5</sup> M, 24h) induced OL death (around 50%), whereas in cultures co-treated with LPC and NFL-TBS.40-63 OL survival, differentiation, and maturation were significantly rescued. The OL cytoskeleton network analyzed by immunocytochemistry with tubuline, tau and MAPs was not altered by the peptide treatment. The intracellular signalling pathway involved has not been identified yet, nevertheless biotinylated peptides were localized into the main processes and the perinuclear cytoplasm of CNP+ OL by confocal microscopy, suggesting endocytosis.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Thus if the release of peptides such as NFL-TBS.40-63 occurs in vivo following axonal damage, it could improve repair through increased OL differentiation and survival, which is a prerequisite for remyelination. The therapeutic potential of the peptide (which appears non toxic) will be determined in vivo by deep intrahemispheric microinjection.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section270-1352458514547846"><title>P623</title><sec id="section271-1352458514547846"><title>Differential glycosylation of KIR4.1 in glia cells affects binding of autoantibodies in multiple sclerosis</title><p><underline>R Srivastava</underline><sup>1</sup>, SR Kalluri<sup>1</sup>, Y Sch&#x000e4;fer<sup>1</sup>, V Grummel<sup>1</sup>, E Kremmer<sup>2</sup>, D Buck<sup>1</sup>, L Schirmer<sup>1</sup>, B Hemmer<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Technische Universit&#x000e4;t, Munich, Germany, <sup>2</sup>Helmholtz Zentrum M&#x000fc;nchen, Core Facility Monoclonal Antibodies, Munich, Germany</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Inward rectifying potassium channel 4.1 (KIR4.1) specific serum antibodies were reported in a sub-population of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. KIR4.1 is a glycosylated channel protein expressed in oligodendrocytes and a subset of astrocytes.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To determine the posttranslational modifications of KIR4.1 occurring in human brain and their impact on autoantibody binding.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> KIR4.1 protein was isolated from human subcortical white and cortical gray matter and transfected HEK293 cells. We performed immunoblot, immunoprecipitation and N-deglycosylation assays to study its molecular heterogeneity and glycosylation. We analyzed the expression pattern of differently glycosylated KIR4.1 in human subcortical brain sections and transfected cells by immunochemistry using polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies (mAb) against the extracellular domain, the C-terminal domain, and KIR4.1-specific IgGs purified from MS sera (KIR4.1-IgG).</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> KIR4.1 contains a functional N-glycosylation site in its first extracellular domain. In a cell-dependent fashion KIR4.1 undergoes simple or complex N-glycosylation. In astrocytes most of KIR4.1 is highly glycosylated (51-60 kD) while oligodendrocytes express predominantly lower glycosylated KIR4.1 (40-42kD). MAb generated against the extracellular domain and KIR4.1-IgG from MS sera specifically precipitate the lower glycosylated KIR4.1 but not higher glycosylated KIR4.1. This mAb and KIR4.1-IgG predominantly bind to oligodendrocytes and to a much lesser extent to astrocytes. In KIR4.1 transfected HEK293 cells most protein is highly glycosylated while only a minor fraction in the endoplasmatic reticulum is weakly glycosylated corresponding to the protein expressed in oligodendrocytes. Separation of different KIR4.1 glycosylation forms demonstrates that MS specific antibodies bind to weakly but not highly glycosylated KIR4.1.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our findings demonstrate that KIR4.1 is differentially glycosylated in a cell specific manner. KIR4.1-IgG from MS sera bind weakly glycosylated KIR4.1 expressed predominantly in oligodendrocytes, while higher glycosylation of KIR4.1 interferes with binding. These findings demonstrate for the first time that posttranslational modification of an autoantigen can influence autoantibody binding and focus the antibody response to a particular subset of cells. These findings have important implications for the understanding of autoantibody responses and for the development of assays to detect autoantibodies in autoimmune diseases.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section272-1352458514547846"><title>P624</title><sec id="section273-1352458514547846"><title>Effect of inflammatory insults on cell viability and its regulation by epigenetic changes in oligodendrocytes</title><p>Y Wang<sup>1</sup>, J Patel<sup>1</sup>, E Loda<sup>1</sup>, D Liebenson<sup>1</sup>, R Goswami<sup>1</sup>, D Stefoski<sup>1</sup>, <underline>R Balabanov</underline><sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Rush University, Neurology, Chicago, IL, United States</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Oligodendrocyte injury and inflammatory demyelination are important pathological abnormalities of multiple sclerosis (MS) as well as in its animal model, the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Emerging evidence over the last decade suggests that oligodendrocytes are not merely immune targets but rather active participants in the neuroimmune network by regulating the events leading to inflammatory demyelination. Several studies have shown that the protection of oligodendrocytes against inflammatory injury results in protection against EAE as well.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To study the effect of inflammatory insults on cell viability and its regulation by epigenetic changes in oligodendrocytes.

Further, in-vitro studies have shown that human oligodendroglioma (HOG) cells treated with cytokines caused cell death. We overexpressed DNMTs and HDACs in HOG cells. HOG cells overexpressing DNMT3B treated with cytokines resulted in increased cell viability. On the contrary, HOG cells overexpressing HDAC1 treated with cytokines resulted in decreased cell viability.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> These results suggest that cytokines may inflict DNA epigenetic changes leading to inflammatory responses.

RGC-32 plays an important role in mediation of TGF-beta downstream effects but its role in gliosis has not been investigated.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> Our objective was to investigate the role of RGC-32 in mediation of TGF- &#x003b2; effects on astrocytes ECM production and expression of reactive markers.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> We examined first the expression of collagen types I to V, decorin and RGC-32 in MS brains by immunohistochemistry and correlate its expression with that of astrocytes (glial fibrillary acidic protein positive cells). To gain more insight into the role played by RGC-32 in gliosis we then examined the role of RGC-32 in mediation of ECM and reactive astrocyte markers expression in cultured astrocytes. To silence RGC-32 expression, astrocytes were transfected with RGC-32 siRNA (Santa Cruz Biotech) and the results compared with that of control siRNA.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Collagen I, III, IV, V and decorin expression was found in the perivascular space and in the parenchyma. Collagen I, IV and V are expressed by astrocytes which were also expressing RGC-32. Since RGC-32 was found to be involved in mediation of TGF- &#x003b2; effects, we investigated its role in TGF- &#x003b2; -induced ECM expression and reactive astrocyte marker &#x003b1;-smooth muscle actin (&#x003b1;-SMA). In cultured astrocytes, &#x003b1;-SMA, collagen I, IV and V as well as fibronectin were significantly induced at 18 h of stimulation with TGF-&#x003b2;. Next, we silenced RGC-32 expression by transfecting astrocytes with siRGC-32 and compared the effect of this treatment to that of control siRNA. We found that &#x003b1;-SMA expression was significantly reduced after RGC-32 silencing (p&#x0003c; 0.05). In addition we found that RGC-32 silencing resulted in a significant reduction in TGF-&#x003b2; induced collagen I (p&#x0003c; 0.01), collagen IV (p&#x0003c; 0.02), collagen V (p&#x0003c; 0.05) and fibronectin (p&#x0003c; 0.05) expression. Using astrocytes isolated from RGC-32 knockout (KO) mouse we found that TGF- &#x003b2; induced collagen IV and &#x003b1;-SMA expression was significantly reduced in RGC-32 KO when compared with wild type mouse.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The effect of RGC-32 silencing on &#x003b1;-SMA expression suggests that RGC-32 is required for the transition of astrocytes to a reactive state. Our data also indicate that RGC-32 plays an important role in the TGF-&#x003b2;-mediated induction of ECM expression in astrocytes.

Previous studies have shown a reduced density of periventricular veins in MS on susceptibility-sensitive T2* imaging at ultra-high field MR correlating with disease severity and T2 lesion load; and such estimation is useful for evaluation of brain oxygen metabolic changes. Recently, there has been increasing recognition of brain involvement in NMO.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> In this multi-center study we aimed at characterizing whether there are venous density changes in NMO using 7 Tesla MRI with high-resolution and high-susceptibility contrast imaging.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Fifteen NMO patients (8 from Berlin and 7 from New York) underwent 7T MRI (Siemens, MAGNETOM) comprising high-resolution 2D susceptibility-sensitive gradient-echo T2*-weighted transversal imaging and fluid attenuated inversion recovery sequences (TIRM). For the quantification of small veins a region-of-interest based algorithm estimating periventricular venous area (PVA) was applied as previously described (Sinnecker et al., Mult Scler 2013).</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> In total, we detected 138 lesions in 15 NMO patients (mean+/-SD 9.2+/-10.9, range 0-34). An initial visual analysis of T2*-weighted images did not reveal any abnormalities regarding periventricular venous density in patients with NMO. Hence, periventricular venous density as indicated by PVA was normal in NMO patients compared to significantly smaller measures of venous density in MS patients as reported previously (Berlin group: mean+/-SD PVA 2.1mm2 +/- 0.3mm2, range 1.8-2.7mm2; New York group: mean+/-SD PVA 1.5mm2 +/- 0.2mm2, range 1.3-2.0mm2; for MS data see Sinnecker et al., Mult Scler 2013).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Periventricular venous density alterations could not be detected in NMO despite the presence of brain parenchymal lesions mimicking MS, reflecting the different underlying pathophysiology between these two autoimmune CNS disorders. Since the visibility of venous density on T2* is associated with the oxygenation level in the venous blood, our finding may help to further elucidate the oxygen metabolic abnormalities and to differentiate between these disease entities.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section289-1352458514547846"><title>P632</title><sec id="section290-1352458514547846"><title>Plasmablasts as AQP4-Ab producers in the pathogenesis of neuromyelitis optica</title><p><underline>N Chihara</underline><sup>1,2,3</sup>, T Aranami<sup>1,4</sup>, S Oki<sup>1</sup>, T Matsuoka<sup>1</sup>, M Nakamura<sup>1</sup>, T Okamoto<sup>4,5</sup>, M Murata<sup>5</sup>, T Toda<sup>2</sup>, S Miyake<sup>1,4</sup>, T Yamamura<sup>1,4</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>National Institute of Neuroscience, National Center of Neurology and Psychiatry (NCNP), Immunology, Tokyo, Japan, <sup>2</sup>Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine, Neurology, Kobe, Japan, <sup>3</sup>Brigham and Women&#x02019;s Hospital, Neurology, Boston, MA, United States, <sup>4</sup>National Center Hospital, NCNP, Multiple Sclerosis Center, Tokyo, Japan, <sup>5</sup>National Center Hospital, NCNP, Neurology, Tokyo, Japan</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Neuromyelitis optica (NMO) is an inflammatory disease of the central nervous system characterized by recurrent attacks of optic neuritis and myelitis. Although the probable autoantigen aquaporin-4 (AQP4) is intensively analyzed and clinical and pathological characterization of NMO has made the clinical entity of anti-AQP4 antibody (AQP4-Ab) spectrum disorders, the immune background remains unclear. We found autoantibody-producing plasmablasts (PBs) that are increased in the peripheral blood of patients.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> In this study, we tried to clarify the fate of circulating PBs in the peripheral blood of NMO.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> A cohort of 20 AQP4-Ab-seropositive patients was recruited. Eight age-matched patients with MS and six healthy subjects were enrolled as controls. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cells, and AQP4-Ab titers were analyzed using a flowcytometer. Single-cell sorted PBs were sequenced for the variable regions of IgG.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> We found that a subset of IgG-producing plasmablasts, which express CD138 and HLA-DR, was increased in the peripheral blood and enriched in the CSF during relapse in patients with NMO. These plasmablasts were found in the peripheral blood of healthy subjects or patients with NMO who received influenza vaccination.</p><p>The frequency of plasmablasts in a portion of patients with NMO who received H1N1 influenza vaccination were elevated from the baseline for more than 6 months after the vaccination, and they displayed frequent relapses compared with that before the vaccination. The AQP4-Ab titers derived from the serum of patients were comparable with the change in plasmablasts.</p><p>In a different analysis, we also found that peripheral plasmablasts during relapse of NMO upregulated CXCR3, directing cells to the inflammatory site, which suggests that PBs may traffic immune cells toward the central nervous system. We isolated plasmablasts for single-cell based sequencing of complementarity-determining regions of IgG from the peripheral blood and CSF of patients with NMO. We revealed that PBs clones in the peripheral blood and CSF from the same patients with NMO showed common complementarity-determining region rearrangements in the IgG heavy chains.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> These results indicate that IgG-producing plasmablasts preferentially migrate to the CSF and could be involved in the following cascades of local inflammation during NMO relapse, which suggests a therapeutic strategy to target PBs and their migration.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section291-1352458514547846"><title>P633</title><sec id="section292-1352458514547846"><title>Neuropsychiatric features of neuromyelitis optica</title><p><underline>P Moore</underline><sup>1</sup>, A Methley<sup>1</sup>, C Pollard<sup>1</sup>, K Mutch<sup>2</sup>, A Jacob<sup>2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>The Walton Centre NHS Foundation Trust, Department of Clinical Neuropsychology, Liverpool, United Kingdom, <sup>2</sup>The Walton Centre NHS Foundation Trust, Department of Neurology, Liverpool, United Kingdom</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Despite recent investigations of brain morphology in NMO there has yet to be an in-depth exploration of the prevalence and severity of psychopathology in NMO.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> The aims of this study were to investigate the prevalence and severity of both cognitive impairments and psychopathology in NMO.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Participants were administered a battery of neuropsychological tests and a structured psychiatric interview (MINI v6).

To date, the origin, migration, and maturation of these CNS B cells, particularly AQP4-IgG producing B cells, is unknown.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> In order to establish B cell migration patterns between the periphery and CNS, we compared the heavy chain (VH) transcriptome from CSF plasmablasts with the VH transcriptome of peripheral B cell populations in 7 NMO patients.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> CSF Ig transcriptome libraries were generated from isolated CSF plasmablasts by single-cell sorting, reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and DNA sequencing. Recombinant antibodies were generated from paired heavy- and light chain sequences and tested for AQP4-reactivity by a cell binding immunofluorescence assay. Peripheral B cells were FACS sorted into na&#x000ef;ve (CD19+CD20+CD27-IgD+), memory (CD19+CD20+CD27+), plasmablast (CD19+CD20-CD27+IgD-CD38++), and triple-negative (CD19+CD20-CD27-IgD-) B cell populations. VH transcriptomes were subsequently generated by RT-PCR and next generation deep sequencing (Illumina MiSeq platform) using barcoded primers equipped with unique molecular identifiers (UMIs).</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> In 5 out of 7 NMO patients, we found an overlap of clonally related B cells across the blood-brain-barrier. On average, 5% of the CSF Ig transcriptome sequences could be linked to blood Ig transcriptome sequences. The overlap between clonally related B cells could be established between CSF plasmablasts and peripheral blood memory B cells, triple-negative B cells, and plasmablasts. VH sequences associated with AQP4-specific CSF antibodies were observed in each of these B cell compartments; however, the pattern of somatic hypermutation in the peripheral blood memory and triple negative B cells were more closely matched to their CSF counterparts. In NMO patients, the proportion of peripheral triple-negative B cells was significantly elevated when compared to MS patients and healthy controls.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our findings indicate that an exchange of B cells occurs between the peripheral and CNS compartment in NMO. AQP4-specific memory and triple negative B cells may be a critical source of CNS AQP4-IgG producing plasmablasts and play a role in the initiation of NMO lesions. Monitoring these peripheral blood populations may prove useful for assessing disease activity and therapy.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section295-1352458514547846"><title>P635</title><sec id="section296-1352458514547846"><title>HLA class 11 alleles and environmental associations with neuromyelitis optica in Indian population</title><p><underline>L Pandit</underline><sup>1</sup>, C Malli<sup>1</sup>, A D&#x02019;Cunha<sup>1</sup>, S Mustafa<sup>1</sup>, R Kunder<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>KS Hegde Medical Academy, Nitte University, Neurology, Mangalore, India</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> It is unclear whether there are genetic and environmental associations with neuromyelitis optica (NMO) particularly in Indian population.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To determine HLA DRB1&#x00026; DQB1 allele associations with NMO.

We previously showed that plasmablasts (PB), which are capable of producing anti-AQP4 antibodies, are increased in the peripheral blood of patients with NMO, and that the survival of PB is dependent on IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) signaling (Chihara et al. PNAS 2011). Therefore, we conducted an exploratory study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of tocilizumab (TCZ), a humanized anti-IL-6R monoclonal antibody, in NMO, and confirmed that TCZ treatment significantly reduced annualized relapse rate, as well as neurogenic pain and fatigue in seven patients with NMO (Araki et al.

The association of the IgG class antibodies directed against the aquaporin-4 channel (AQP4-IgG) allows early diagnosis of limited forms, such as ON or myelitis, considered part of the spectrum of NMO disorders (NMOSD). Acute exacerbations are treated with methylprednisolone, followed by plasmapheresis in refractory patients.

Its impact on clinical disability has been studied in MS but only rarely in NMO. Furthermore the involvement of the periventricular system in NMO has been a focus of interest in recent publications, however the relevance of ventricular widening as an indirect measure for central atrophy to clinical disability remains unknown.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To identify different spinal cord and brain atrophy patterns in NMO and MS patients and assess their impact on clinical disability.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> 18 NMO patients, 20 MS patients and 26 healthy controls, matched for age and disease duration (patients) were included retrospectively. Patients&#x02019; disability status was scored according to the expanded disability status scale (EDSS). Quantitative MRI included semi-automated volumetry of the upper cervical cord (UCCA), brain grey (GM) and white matter (WM), lateral, 3<sup>rd</sup>.

Differences between the groups and associations between volumetry and clinical status were investigated by t-tests, Spearman rho correlation analyses and univariate respectively multivariate regression analyses.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> NMO patients and MS patients had similar levels of UCCA atrophy (75.2 mm<sup>2</sup> respectively 76.5 mm<sup>2</sup> versus 84.1 mm<sup>2</sup> in controls) although the MS patients were only moderately clinically affected (EDSS: 3.3 +-1.1 versus 4.9 +-2.2 in NMO). 3VV was increased in both diseases, while 4VV widening was specific for MS. Correlations between UCCA and EDSS were significant in NMO and in MS. Multivariate regression analyses including all MRI parameters which were significantly associated with EDSS in the univariate regression and age and disease duration resulted in UCCA and 3VV (R<sup>2</sup>=0.461) as most significant to determine EDSS in NMO, while in the MS group GM and 4VV (R<sup>2</sup>=0.483) were the most explanatory MRI parameters for the disability score.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Both upper cervical cord atrophy and 3VV enlargement have been found to be relevant for clinical disability in NMO. Periependymal dysfunctions may cause widening of the 3VV in NMO.

In comparison to multiple sclerosis, exacerbations are often more severe, respond less to therapy and leave a residual deficit. High-dose IV steroid therapy (HD-S) and plasma exchange (PLEX) are recommended treatments of NMO relapses.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To describe frequency and sequence of therapies used for NMO relapses and to evaluate the remission status upon these therapies.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Using a nation-wide registry (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nemos-net.de">www.nemos-net.de</ext-link>), we retrospectively reviewed records of NMO patients with a standardized evaluation form to assess demographic and diagnostic data, relapses (clinical appearance, severity, therapies), and the short-term remission status rated as either complete, incomplete, none, or missing data (MD). We included all patients with Wingerchuk NMO or aquaporin-4-positive NMOSD who had &#x02265;1 relapse with sufficient documentation. Patients or relapses with insufficient data were excluded.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> We identified 186 patients (143 NMO, 43 NMOSD, 152 female) with a total of 1124 relapses. Mean age at disease onset was 40 years, mean duration of follow-up 7 years. The annualized relapse rate was 1.06 (95% CI 0.96-1.12). 150 patients had &#x02265;1 optic neuritis (ON) and 179 patients had &#x02265;1 myelitis (MY). Episodes of isolated MY (59%) were more frequent than isolated ON (28%), MY+ON (10%), and other presentations (1%). ON was unilateral in 82% and bilateral in 18%. After exclusion of 284 relapses due to insufficient data, non-standard or no therapy, 840 relapses with a total of 1168 treatment cycles were assessed. These comprised HD-S (n=856), PLEX (n=192), immunoadsorption (n=38), intrathecal steroids (n=23), intravenous immunoglobulins (n=21), and others (n=51). First-line treatment induced complete remission in 17%, incomplete in 60%, and no remission in 16% (7% MD). Frequency of relapses requiring a second, third, forth, and fifth line therapy were 30%, 8%, 1%, 1%, respectively. After the last treatment cycle, 19% of relapses showed complete, 67% partial, and 7% no remission (7% MD). Remission rates were higher for PLEX and immunoadsorption compared to HD-S. ON responded significantly better than MY.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> NMO and NMOSD exacerbations are frequent and have poor remission rates, in particular MY. Treatment strategies are highly heterogeneous and HD-S and PLEX most commonly used. Escalation of relapse therapy improves remission in some patients.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section307-1352458514547846"><title>P641</title><sec id="section308-1352458514547846"><title>Clinical and radiological profiles of anterior visual pathway involvement in neuromyelitis optica</title><p><underline>I Kawachi</underline><sup>1</sup>, A Yokoseki<sup>1</sup>, E Saji<sup>1</sup>, M Hokari<sup>1</sup>, K Yanagawa<sup>1</sup>, M Nishizawa<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Niigata University, Department of Neurology, Brain Research Institute, Niigata, Japan</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> The anterior visual pathway is a frequent site of injury, as shown by optic neuritis (ON) during the course of neuromyelitis optica (NMO); however, the details of pathomechanism in ON of NMO remain unclear.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To elucidate the clinical and radiological characteristics of anterior visual pathway involvement in NMO.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> We performed a retrospective study of 17 NMO spectrum disorder (NMOsd) patients (28 attacks) and 16 MS patients (25 attacks) with history of visual impairments, and investigated visual acuity (VA), visual field (VF), optical coherence tomography (OCT), and MRI findings. In this study, serum testing yielded positive results for aquaporin-4 (AQP4) antibodies in all patients with NMOsd, and negative results in all patients with MS.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The mean VA and mean deviation (MD) of VF at ON attacks were significantly worse in eyes of NMOsd patients than those of MS patients (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001). According to the VF classification used in the Optic Neuritis Treatment Trial, the frequency of NMOsd patients with total loss of vision was significantly higher than that of MS patients at ON attacks (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01), but the frequency of NMOsd patients with central abnormalities was significantly lower than that of MS at ON attacks (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). Contrast-enhanced MRI assessments at ON attacks indicated that the length of abnormally enhanced lesions in patients with NMOsd was significantly longer than that in patients with MS (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). Moreover, optic perineuritis, referred to as &#x02018;tramtrack sign&#x02019; on axial views of MRI and &#x02018;doughnut sign&#x02019; on coronal views, was present in not only MS patients (29%) but also NMOsd patients (46%), suggesting evidence of optic nerve sheath inflammation.

Since autoantibodies against complement regulating factors may contribute to the activation of the complement system, here we examined the presence of antibodies against the complement regulator protein factor H in the serum of patients with NMO.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> The study cohort included 45 patients with NMO, who were all seropositive for AQP4 autoantibodies, 25 healthy controls and control sera from patients with hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) seropositive for factor H antibodies. Serum samples were screened by ELISA for autoantibodies using purified factor H as target antigen and human serum albumin as control antigen.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Specific IgG binding to factor H was detected in 4 samples (~9%), while no IgG binding to factor H was detected from 25 control sera. We could also detect factor H-IgG complexes using a monoclonal antibody to factor H as a catch antibody in ELISA. The binding sites of the factor H autoantibodies were mapped using recombinant constructs representing various factor H domains. All autoantibodies bound to factor H domains 19-20, and also recognized the homologous protein CFHR1. This binding pattern was similar to factor H autoantibodies associated with atypical HUS, used as positive controls in the assays.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our results demonstrate that factor H autoantibodies are not uncommon in NMO.

The clinical decision to escalate treatment to PLEX was based on poor response to IVMP. Extended disability status score (EDSS) was calculated for each patient prior to admission, at presentation, at discharge from the hospital and on follow-up in clinic (if available).</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Nineteen NMO relapses were treated with a course of high dose IVMP while 65 relapses were treated with high dose IVMP + PLEX. In the IVMP-alone group, the median baseline EDSS was 2.5, which increased to 6.0 on presentation. The degree of improvement on discharge reached a median of 5.0 but this improvement was not maintained on follow up in clinic. In the IVMP + PLEX group, the median baseline EDSS was 5.5, the median EDSS on presentation was 7.5 which decreased to a median of 6.5 on discharge and maintained at a median of 6.5 on follow up visit within 1 year of discharge. Sixty five percent of IVMP + PLEX patients achieved an EDSS that is equal or below baseline at follow up while only 35% of the IVMP-only patients achieved their baseline EDSS (odds ratio=0.2961, 95% CI 0.0946 to 0.9266, P= 0.0365). A delay of more than 3 weeks from onset of relapse to initiation of plasma exchange was associated with a lower likelihood of success.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> High dose IVMP provides only a moderate degree of neurologic recovery from acute NMO relapses.

The cohort included 45 Caucasians, 15 Afro-Caribbean&#x02019;s, 9 Asians and 13 mixed race /other. Only 3.6% had both transverse myelitis (TM) and optic neuritis at onset.

Differential diagnosis between these two disorders is important because of difference in prognosis and treatment. Although several clinical characteristics of ON may help differentiate NMO from MS, an episode of NMO-related ON is often indistinguishable from MS-related ON.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> The purpose of this pilot study was to evaluate the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features of optic nerve during acute ON in NMO and MS patients.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> We identified brain and orbit MRI of 11 MS (3 males and 8 females; mean age at ON 31.8 &#x000b1; 12.0) and 17 NMO (2 males and 15 females; mean age at ON = 34.0 &#x000b1; 10.6) patients who presented with ON. All MRI obtained within 6 weeks of ON and were reviewed by two neuroradiologists masked to the diagnosis. The parameters for MRI analysis included the presence and degree optic nerve enhancement, optic nerve thickening, and the extent and location of optic nerve involvement. The length, cross section area (CSA) and T2 signal intensity of the affected part of optic nerve were measured. The length was measured using curved multiplanar reconstruction from 3D FLAIR data. CSA were compared with unaffected part of optic nerve (contralateral unaffected nerve or inpsilateral unaffected part in bilateral ON cases). The T2 signal intensity ratio between affected optic nerve segment and unaffected cerebral cortex was calculated.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The length of affected segment was significantly longer in NMO-related ON than MS-related ON (33.6 mm &#x000b1; 15.0 vs. 20.8 mm &#x000b1; 11.6, <italic>p</italic> = 0.024). T2 signal intensity ratio between affected optic nerve segment and unaffected cerebral cortex was significantly higher in NMO-related ON than MS-related ON (1.3 &#x000b1; 0.2 vs. 0.9 &#x000b1; 0.1, <italic>p</italic> = &#x0003c; 0.001). No significant differences were demonstrated in the CSA of affected segment, degree of optic nerve enhancement, and location of optic nerve involvement between MS- and NMO-related ON.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> These findings suggests that the length of affected segment and T2 signal intensity ratio between affected optic nerve and unaffected cerebral cortex may help distinguish between MS-related ON and NMO-related ON. NMO-related ON appears to have more extensive and more inflammatory lesion than MS-related ON.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section327-1352458514547846"><title>P651</title><sec id="section328-1352458514547846"><title>Involvement of cerebral cortex in anti-aquaporin-4 antibody seropositive neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder patients</title><p>SY Kim<sup>1</sup>, <underline>W Kim</underline><sup>1</sup>, S-H Kim<sup>2</sup>, S-Y Huh<sup>3</sup>, J-W Hyun<sup>2</sup>, IH Jeong<sup>2</sup>, M-S Park<sup>4</sup>, JY Cho<sup>5</sup>, HY Shin<sup>6</sup>, SM Kim<sup>6</sup>, J-H Rha<sup>7</sup>, S-H Lee<sup>2</sup>, HJ Kim<sup>2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea, Republic of, <sup>2</sup>Research Institute and Hospital of National Cancer Center, Goyang, Korea, Republic of, <sup>3</sup>Kosin University College of Medicine, Busan, Korea, Republic of, <sup>4</sup>Yeungnam University College of Medicine, Daegu, Korea, Republic of, <sup>5</sup>Inje University Ilsan Paik Hospital, Goyang, Korea, Republic of, <sup>6</sup>Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea, Republic of, <sup>7</sup>Inha University Hospital, Incheon, Korea, Republic of</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Brain lesions with characteristic locations and configurations are helpful in the diagnosis of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD). It was previously reported that cortical lesions were not found in patients with NMO, which was contrast to multiple sclerosis (MS).</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> We aimed to determine whether involvement of cerebral cortex is present on conventional brain MRI in anti-aquaporin-4 antibody positive NMOSD patients and to describe their imaging and clinical characteristics.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> In this study, 215 anti-aquaporin-4 antibody positive NMOSD patients from six referral hospitals were involved. We retrospectively analyzed demographic, clinical, and MRI findings of the enrolled patients. All MRI scans were performed on either a 1.5- or a 3.0-T machine. Abnormal lesions involving cerebral cortex on brain MRIs were identified, by consensus of three experienced observers, a neuroradiologist and two neurologists.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Among 215 enrolled patients, 87% were female. Median age at onset was 33.3 (5-60) years and mean follow-up duration was 123 months. During follow-up, brain MRI was performed in 194 patients, and brain lesions were found in 143 patients (74%). Brain lesions involving cerebral cortex were identified in six patients (3.1%). Five of them (83.3%) were female, and their mean age was 29.5 (16-46) years when the cortical lesions were presented. Interestingly, four of them showed leptomeningeal enhancement in the lesions. The lesions showed heterogeneous signal intensity and blurred margins. The cortical lesions were located most commonly in frontal and occipital lobe, and presented with other previously described brain lesions characteristic of NMOSD. At the presentation of the cortical lesions, three of them were not treated, two were treated with beta-interferon, and one with oral prednisolone. Two patients were presented with encephalopathy, one showed myoclonus of the contralateral arm, and three did not show obvious symptoms correlated with the cortical lesions.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> This study shows that although very rare, cortical involvement occurs in NMOSD patients and is commonly combined with leptomeningeal enhancement. It is speculated that this rare findings may occur only in patients who are not properly treated.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section329-1352458514547846"><title>P652</title><sec id="section330-1352458514547846"><title>NMO and NMOSD: clinical, imaging.

Associations of autoimmune diseases with NF1 have rarely been described. There are 5 case reports of NF1 with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and 6 case reports of NF1 with multiple sclerosis in the medical literature up-to-date. Neuromyelitis optica (NMO) spectrum disorders include a series of syndromes associated with aquaporin-4 seropositivity. NMO with concomitant SLE or high titer antinuclear autoantibodies (ANA) has been described, but association of NMO with NF1 has never been reported.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To report a case of a patient with NF1 and high titer ANA, who developed NMO.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Longitudinal case report.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> We report a case of a 65-year-old African-American female with NF1, who presented with 8 weeks of bilateral leg stiffness, paresthesia up to breast line, urinary retention and bowel incontinence in June 2006. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was negative for oligoclonal bands or malignancy. She had positive ANA, but did not fulfill criteria for SLE. Imaging studies showed normal brain, abnormal T2 hyperintensity from T2-T6, as seen in myelitis and L3-L5 root lesions which were proven to be neurofibromas. She regained urinary control and her gait improved after intravenous corticosteroid treatment. A diagnosis of autoimmune myelitis was made.</p><p>Patient was treated with oral steroids and mycophenolate mofetil (MM) for 4 years and continued to be stable on MM alone for 2 years. In December 2012, after reducing the MM, she had a relapse of her symproms with an incomplete response to intravenous corticosteroid treatment. Her previous dose of MM was restarted. In April 2013 she developed right-sided hemiparesis. Neuroimaging showed worsening of her thoracic spine lesion and a new cervical spine lesion from C3-C6. Patient had seropositive aquaporin-4 antibody and was diagnosed with NMO spectrum disorder.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> This is the first case of an NF1 patient with NMO spectrum disorder described in the literature.

The mean age of the patients was 40.1&#x000b1;14.1 (12-77) years. The disease duration was 4.5&#x000b1;4.5 years. The disease course was relapsing in 70 patients (81%). The first attack was bilateral ON (BON) and TM in 3 patients, ON and TM in 1 patient, ON in 50 patients (bilateral in 6) and TM in 26 patients.

NMO IgG was positive in 12 patients with NMO (55%), 4 patients with LETM (25%), and 8 patients with RON (22%). Oligoclonal band was positive in 15 out of 44 patients (4 each with NMO and ON, two with ON and TM and three with LETM; 34%).

Attacks can be devastating, especially damage by ON is more severe than in multiple sclerosis. Previous studies reported retinal nerve fiber layer thinning in ON eyes of NMO patients but data on cerebral grey and white matter damage are limited.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To investigate whether RNFL (retinal nerve fiber layer) and GCL (ganglion cell layer) thinning in eyes after ON is associated with white or grey matter brain atrophy.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> 24 patients with NMO and NMO spectrum disorders with ON and 21 sex and age matched healthy control subjects were enrolled. All subjects underwent spectral domain OCT examinations with RNFL and GCL analysis and 3T MRI. T1w scans were lesion-corrected before estimating normalized grey and white brain volumes (NGMV, NWMV) with FSL SIENAX and Voxel Based Morphometry (VBM).

Optic neuritis (ON) is a common acute manifestation of MS onset; similarly, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mice, a rodent model of MS, exhibit ON. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) allows for direct visualization and measurement of optic nerve head topography and measurement of layer thickness between retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). Quantification of retinal layers by OCT provides an indirect measure of axonal and neuronal loss in anterior visual pathways. Optic neuropathies and numerous neurologic disorders, including MS, show abnormal retinal layer thickness.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> We investigated the effects of late myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG<sub>35-55</sub>)-induced chronic EAE and therapeutic treatment of chronic EAE mice with the highly selective estrogen receptor &#x003b2; ligand Indazole-Cl (Ind-Cl) on retina and optic nerve health.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Fundus imaging and serial high-resolution spectral domain optical coherence tomography (sdOCT), followed by immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy analysis, were performed on normal animals and chronic EAE mice therapeutically treated with Ind-Cl or vehicle (i.e., after peak clinical disease). Image analysis using template-based marking of retinal layers (RNFL, GCL, nuclear layers, and retinal pigment epithelium-RPE) was performed using Bioptigen software (Durham, NC).</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Significant changes in RNFL, GCL and RPE retinal layers between normal, vehicle-, and Ind-Cl-treated EAE groups were observed. Preliminary immunohistochemical and electron microscopy data indicate increased inflammation in the retina and optic nerve and decreased axon myelination in the optic nerves of EAE mice. As compared to vehicle treatment, therapeutic treatment with Ind-Cl decreased retinal and optic nerve inflammation and improved optic nerve axon myelination.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> These data support OCT and optic nerve analysis as strongly translational in vivo biomarkers with which to assess the efficacies of potential neuroprotective agents for the treatment of inflammatory neurodegenerative diseases. Further, these data support therapeutic Ind-Cl as a treatment capable of improving widespread, quality-of-life-diminishing MS-related retinal and optic nerve pathology.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section344-1352458514547846"><title>P659</title><sec id="section345-1352458514547846"><title>Retrograde axonal and neuronal degeneration of the retina in acute optic neuritis</title><p><underline>EH Mart&#x000ed;nez-Lapiscina</underline><sup>1</sup>, I Gabilondo<sup>1</sup>, E Fraga-Pumar<sup>1</sup>, S Ortiz-Perez<sup>2</sup>, R Torres-Torres<sup>2</sup>, M Andorr&#x000e0;<sup>1</sup>, S Llufriu<sup>1</sup>, A Saiz<sup>3</sup>, B Sanchez-Dalmau<sup>2</sup>, P Villoslada<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>August Pi i Sunyer Biomedical Research Institute (IDIBAPS), Barcelona, Spain, <sup>2</sup>Hospital Clinic of Barcelona, ICOF, Barcelona, Spain, <sup>3</sup>Hospital Clinic of Barcelona, Neurology, Barcelona, Spain</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> A detailed description of the diffusion of retinal damage in acute optic neuritis (ON) and its correlation with visual disability is relevant for the understanding and clinical management of axonal and neuronal degeneration in ON.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To assess the dynamics of retinal damage after ON by Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) and to identify early OCT predictors of visual disability.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> We analyzed 31 consecutive patients with incident acute ON (idiopathic or associated to MS) from clinical onset to month 6. Patients were recruited by their physicians after signing informed consent. We performed retinal OCT (Spectralis) at baseline and every month (7 visits) evaluating thicknesses of peripapilar retinal nerve fiber layer (pRNFLTH) and macular layers with device&#x02019;s software and best-corrected high contrast (HCVA), low contrast (LCVA) and color visual acuity (CVA), and visual field testing (VF) every 2 months from baseline (4 visits). The predictive value of early OCT measures as biomarkers of visual disability was tested by logistic regression.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> After 6 months, ON-eyes decreased 39.6 &#x000b5;m in pRNFLTH and 14.8 &#x000b5;m in macular thickness. Macular atrophy was due to decrease of macular RNFLTH (- 7.4 &#x000b5;m) and ganglion cell layer + inner plexiform layer complex thickness (GCIPTH) (-10.2 &#x000b5;m), while outer layers thickness increased slightly. Most pRNFLTH reduction occurred in first 2 months while macular thickness decreased progressively along 3-6 months. We observed different responses for inner and outer macular layers: while RNFLTH and GCIPTH decreased every month (specially in first 2 months), thickness of outer layers increased in first 2 months (partially compensating RNFL and GCIP thinning), and decreased thereafter by month 3 to 6. Macular atrophy was more severe and homogeneous in internal sectors (parafovea) and dependent on GCIP thinning, and atrophy of external sectors was more related to RNFL thinning in papillomacular bundle.

Injury to the anterior visual pathway is also extremely common in MS. The retino-hypothalamic pathway is important biologically in that it entrains the circadian rhythm. Injury to the anterior visual pathway has not been explored as a contributor to fatigue in patients with MS.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> We examine visual pathway neuronal and axonal loss as predictors of fatigue in two cohorts of MS patients.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL), total macular volume (TMV) and Ganglion cell Layer (GCL) were measured using Optical coherence tomography (OCT) in two independent cohorts. In the first cohort, fatigue was captured by the modified fatigue impact scale (MFIS). Participants scoring &#x02265; 38 were categorized as fatigued.

Forty eight percent of fatigued participants and 45% of non-fatigued participants had a history of optic neuritis (ON). Ninety five percent and 5% of participants in both groups had relapsing remitting MS (RRMS) and secondary progressive MS (SPMS), respectively. GCL but not RNFL thinning predicted the presence of fatigue (OR 1.4, 95% CI 1.04 - 1.87, p=0.028 and OR 1.15, 95% CI 0.98 - 1.35, p=0.079, respectively.</p><p>Among 331 participants in the second cohort, 64% reported fatigue.

Retinal structure injury studies have evolved as investigational outcomes to study disease pathology in MS. Several clinical and MRI studies have shown that African-Americans with MS (AA-MS) experience more aggressive disease course and greater tissue injury in the CNS than Caucasians with MS (CAU-MS). However, no study has been conducted to examine retinal structure injury in AA-MS and compared to CAU-MS.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To examine retinal structure including RNFL and macular volume in AAMS. To compare retinal structure injury in CAU-MS.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Records of all relapsing MS patients who underwent OCT between January 2013 and March 2014 at our MS Center, were examined, after obtaining local IRB approval. Clinical history including EDSS scores were obtained from patient records. Brain MRI and CSF data were also reviewed when available. All patients and healthy controls (HC) underwent Spectral Domain OCT (SD-OCT) with the Heidelberg Spectralis (HRT+OCT). Images were processed by Heidelberg software version 5.4. Segmentation of macular scan was performed by Heidelberg, blinded to study participant clinical status or race.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> 150 MS patients and 55 HC were enrolled. Of the 150 MS patients, 61 were AA-MS (mean age 41.8 years, EDSS 3.8, disease duration 8.1years, DMT exposure 5.2 years) and 89 were CAU-MS (mean age 43.5 years, EDSS 2.3, disease duration 10 years, DMT exposure 5.5 years). Mean RNFL global thickness was 85.2 mm<sup>3</sup> in AA-MS and 89.5 mm<sup>3</sup> in CAU-MS (p=0.06). Mean macular volume was 8.16 mm<sup>3</sup> in AA-MS vs 8.38 mm<sup>3</sup> in CAU-MS (p=0.0004). Mean RNFL volume was 0.77 mm<sup>3</sup> in AA-MS and 0.84 mm<sup>3</sup> in CAU-MS (p=.002). Sub-analysis performed in patients with no history of ON, showed AA-MS had macular volume of 8.19 mm<sup>3</sup> and CAU-MS 8.44 mm<sup>3</sup> (p&#x0003c; 0.0001). Compared to HC, MS patients demonstrated significantly reduced RNFL thickness and macular volume. Preliminary analysis also indicate significant correlation between RNFL and CSF IgG Index. Further analysis is ongoing.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> This is the first study to examine retinal structure injury in AA-MS. Our study demonstrates that AA-MS experience greater RNFL and macular atrophy than CAU-MS. In patients without history of optic neuritis, our results extend previous observations of greater irreversible tissue loss in AA-MS compared to CAU-MS. Collectively, these findings confirm previous clinical and MRI observations suggesting greater tissue injury in the CNS in AA-MS compared to CAU-MS.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section350-1352458514547846"><title>P662</title><sec id="section351-1352458514547846"><title>Impaired color vision as determined by Farnsworth Munsell 100 Hue testing is tightly associated with retinal thinning in multiple sclerosis</title><p><underline>EE Longbrake</underline><sup>1</sup>, S Lancia<sup>1</sup>, N Tutlam<sup>1</sup>, RT Naismith<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Washington University, Neurology, St. Louis, MO, United States</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Color vision abnormalities are common among patients with multiple sclerosis.

The FM-100 is probably the definitive test for impaired color vision, but it is time-consuming to administer and has not been formally assessed in conjunction with retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness as measured by optical coherence tomography (OCT) and other tests of visual function.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> We sought to determine the relationship between the FM-100 and other visual outcome measures in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients who had previously suffered optic neuritis (ON).</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Forty six MS patients with stable ON for at least 3 months were enrolled as part of a clinical trial.

FM-100 scores correlated strongly with other measures of visual function, including HCVA (&#x003c1;=&#x02212;0.68, p&#x0003c; 0.001), LCVA (&#x003c1;=&#x02212;0.671, p&#x0003c; 0.001), RNFL thickness (&#x003c1;=&#x02212;0.574, p&#x0003c; 0.001), and VEP 60-minute amplitudes (&#x003c1;=&#x02212;0.353, p=0.001) but did not correlate with P-100 latencies on VEP testing. FM-100 scores also correlated with visual function quality of life testing (&#x003c1;=&#x02212;0.219, p=0.039). FM-100 scores were reproducible over multiple visits. The magnitude of the correlation between color vision disturbance and average RNFL thickness as determined by the current study was &#x003c1;=&#x02212;0.574,p&#x0003c; 0.001, similar to that previously reported using HRR plates (&#x003c1;=0.594, p&#x0003c; 0.0001) and stronger than that established using LD15 scores (&#x003c1;=&#x02212;0.424, p=0.035).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> FM-100 scores correlate strongly with other quantitative measures of visual function and less strongly with visual quality of life testing.

The utility of GCL measurement as a structural biomarker for ON is unknown.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> We investigated the trajectory of GCL thinning over 6 months in order to determine when most of the loss occurs and how the amount of GCL loss relates to the vision outcome.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Using spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) of the optic nerve head and macula areas we prospectively evaluated 33 patients (age 36&#x000b1;10) with ON within 2 weeks of vision loss, at one month and at 6 months. We used 3D-segmentation to calculate the average GCL plus interplexiform layer thickness (IPL) for each macula image.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The maximum amount of GCL thinning occurred at 1 month with mean loss of 9.33 &#x000b5;m&#x000b1; 5.27. A modest, further thinning of the GCL occurred between 3 and 6 months (2.68 &#x000b5;m and 0.58 &#x000b5;m, respectively). The amount of GCL thinning at 1 month strongly correlated with the amount of GCL loss at 6 months (r=0.837). There was no correlation between the GCL thickness at one month and the mean deviation of the visual field (r=0.033). The RNFL was thickened at presentation and 1 month and did not correlate with mean deviation of the visual field at that time point. The RNFL did not show thinning until the 3 and 6-month time points. GCL thickness at 1 or 6 months did not correlate with the 6 month visual acuity or mean deviation, which had markedly improved in all eyes. Thinning of the RNFL and GCL at 6 months were moderately correlated (r=0.48, p =0.02).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> For acute optic neuritis, the largest proportion of GCL loss has already occurred by one month and suggests that neural preservation or protection therapy must be delivered earlier to significantly prevent loss of retinal ganglion cells. GCL measurement appears to be a reliable biomarker to demonstrate early loss; and as an outcome measure of optic neuritis, it shows residual injury better than the RNFL or perimetry or high contrast visual acuity assessment.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section354-1352458514547846"><title>P664</title><sec id="section355-1352458514547846"><title>Ocular motility: a potential method of quantifying progressive cerebral dysfunction in multiple sclerosis and clinically isolated syndrome</title><p>M Clough<sup>1</sup>, L Mitchell<sup>1</sup>, L Millist<sup>2,3</sup>, O White<sup>1,2,3</sup>, <underline>J Fielding</underline><sup>1,2,3</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Monash University, Clayton, Australia, <sup>2</sup>University of Melbourne, Parkville, Australia, <sup>3</sup>Royal Melbourne Hospital, Department of Neurology, Parkville, Australia</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory disease of the central nervous system. However, emerging evidence suggests that neurodegenerative changes are also an important disease process, occurring at the earliest stages of MS, including clinically isolated syndrome (CIS). These changes often predate explicit lesion formation as evident on standard clinical scans, and affect the connectivity of distributed cerebral networks. With neurodegenerative pathology known to increase with disease duration, often in the absence of increasing lesion pathology, sensitively monitoring these changes from the earliest stages is imperative for the analysis of progression. The ocular motor (OM) network provides a unique opportunity to sensitively quantify both disseminated (neurodegenerative) and discrete (lesions) changes providing a comprehensive measure of cerebral functioning.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> We aimed to determine whether OM assessment sensitively dissociates deficit as a function of disease duration in MS including from initial presentation of the disease (CIS).</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Our study used 5 discrete OM tasks, each implicating cognitive processes commonly affected in MS; visually guided saccades, baseline task; antisaccades, inhibition of an exogenously elicited response; endogenously cued saccades, inhibition of an endogenously elicited response; memory guided saccades, working memory (WM) and inhibition; spatial <italic>n</italic>-back task, WM deficit as a function of increasing WM load. 25 patients with a CIS suggestive of MS, 25 MS patients within 7 years of diagnosis (CDMS early), 25 MS patients greater than 7 years from diagnosis (CDMS late), and 25 healthy controls were compared on all tasks, including neurpsychological tasks.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> All patient groups made a significantly higher proportion of errors across all OM tasks compared with controls.

RRMS patients frequently experience visual loss caused by optic neuritis (ON). In contrast, PPMS patients develop ON much less frequently but often complain of photosensitivity. Despite these clinical differences, very little data compare the anatomic and electrophysiological findings of the afferent visual system for PPMS and RRMS.

Only PPMS and RRMS patients who underwent 103-hexagon multifocal electroretinogram (mfERG) and spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) within a three month span were included. All eyes were divided into four groups: [1] RRMS and [2] PPMS eyes with no history of ON and [3] RRMS and [4] PPMS eyes with a history of ON. Response densities of mfERG amplitudes and latencies were averaged into six concentric rings [R1-R6]. Retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) and macular thicknesses were obtained via SD-OCT.

In eyes without a history of ON, inner ring amplitudes (N1 [R2-R4], P1 [R1-R4], N2 [R1-R5]) were decreased in PPMS compared to RRMS (p&#x0003c; 0.02). N1, P1 and N2 latencies for outer rings [R4-R6] were increased in PPMS patients (p&#x0003c; 0.04).

In the published literature, different approaches for intra-retinal layer thicknes estimation have been used. Previously it was shown that different point estimates can provide comparable data. However, no data exist on the reliability or reproducibility of different point estimates, which is crucial for their future application in clinical studies.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To evaluate the reliability of different point estimates for intra-retinal thickness determination.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> We searched pubmed for articles that have used intra-retinal layer segmentation of OCT data in patients with MS. To analyze the reproducibility of the methods published with the Spectralis OCT (Heidelberg Engineering), we generated a simulation dataset consisting of 15 healthy subjects, each measured 3 times with all scans previously used in published studies. Segmentation was performed automatically with Heidelberg Eye Explorer (version 6.0.0.7) and manually corrected in cases of errors. We simulated each point estimate on the repeated sessions and analyzed reproducibility with intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC).</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> We identified 27 research articles, which presented results for intra-retinal layer analysis of MS patients. 11 of them used Spectralis OCT, 10 Cirrus OCT (Carl Zeiss Meditec), 2 studies used both devices, 2 studies RTVue-100 (Optovue) and one study used 2 research devices. For the Spectralis OCT, 9 different point estimates were used. In the simulation dataset, approaches using the mean thickness of the area around the fovea (6 mm and 3 mm diameter ETDRS area) showed excellent reproducibility (ICC &#x0003e; 0.91) for all retinal layers except for the outer plexiform layer (OPL), which had a different appearance in each repeated session and was not segmented consistently. Point estimates using only single values or limited number of values at pre-defined locations performed generally weaker in the reproducibility analysis.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Point estimates based on ETDRS areas showed good reliability and should be favored when OCT is used in clinical research. On the contrary, point estimates with single layer analysis should be avoided based on their weak reliability. Assessment of the OPL was weak in all investigated point estimates and needs further investigation before OPL thickness can be used as a reliable parameter.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section360-1352458514547846"><title>P667</title><sec id="section361-1352458514547846"><title>Longitudinal correlation of retinal nerve fiber layer and timed 25 foot walk in a large MS cohort</title><p><underline>C Fjeldstad</underline><sup>1</sup>, JP Weir<sup>2</sup>, G Pardo<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation, MS Center of Excellence, Oklahoma City, OK, United States, <sup>2</sup>University of Kansas, Department of Health, Sport, and Exercise Sciences, Lawrence, KS, United States</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> There is a need to identify anatomical biomarkers of disease progression in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) that are practical, inexpensive, and easy to perform.

The timed 25 foot walk (T25FW) is a simple bedside test that has been identified as having a relationship with functional level, gait, and disease progression.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> Identify if RNFL measurement by OCT correlates with T25FW and serves as a surrogate anatomical marker of functional decline in individuals with MS.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> This was a longitudinal study of 299 MS patients with mean age of 48.7 (&#x000b1; .73). The sample consisted of 238 females and 61 males. Each subject had OCT and T25FW measured at two time-points, separated by 1 to 3 years.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> A small but statistically significant negative relationship was found for RNFL and T25FW at first year (Spearman rho = &#x02212;0.13, p = .049). The results were similar at the second time period (Spearman rho = &#x02212;0.16, p = .009). Similar results were found after categorizing T25FW scores using benchmarks reported in the literature as being clinically meaningful, and comparing RNFL scores using ANOVA (p ~ 0.02, omega squared = .02 at both time periods). The mean T25FW delta score was not significantly lower from walk one to walk two (mean delta = 0.20 seconds, 95% CI = &#x02212;0.10 to 0.51), but RNFL delta score was significantly lower on the second test (mean delta = &#x02212;1.7, 95% CI= &#x02212;2.29 to -1.10).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> This study examined the relationship between RNFL and T25FW over a follow of up to three years. Although a significant relationship was found between RNFL and T25FW, the effect was very small making it difficult to infer any clinical relevance from it. Larger cohorts and longer time frames are warranted to be able to establish significant relevance for clinical purpose.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section362-1352458514547846"><title>P668</title><sec id="section363-1352458514547846"><title>Relapsing inflammatory optic neuropathy: clinical description in a serie of 16 patients</title><p><underline>L Navarro</underline><sup>1</sup>, C Alcal&#x000e1;<sup>2</sup>, I Bosc&#x000e1;<sup>2</sup>, F P&#x000e9;rez-Miralles<sup>2</sup>, M Sim&#x000f3;-Castell&#x000f3;<sup>2</sup>, F Coret<sup>3</sup>, D Sola<sup>1</sup>, F Gasc&#x000f3;n<sup>3</sup>, I Cal<sup>2</sup>, A Navarr&#x000e9;<sup>4</sup>, R Gallego<sup>2</sup>, A Saiz<sup>5</sup>, B Casanova<sup>2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Hospital General Universitario de Elche, Elche, Spain, <sup>2</sup>Hospital Universitari i Polit&#x000e8;cnic La Fe, Valencia, Spain, <sup>3</sup>Hospital Cl&#x000ed;nico Universitario de Valencia, Valencia, Spain, <sup>4</sup>Hospital de Sagunto, Sagunto, Spain, <sup>5</sup>Hospital Cl&#x000ed;nic de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Chronic relapsing inflammatory optic neuropathy (CRION), recently described, is characterized by subacute inflammatory optic neuropathy, bilateral often with prominent pain, and a clinical course with recurrences and remissions. The main feature is early response to systemic corticosteroids and recurrence on steroid withdrawal. The diagnosis requires that there not be a evidence of additional neurological deficit, sarcoidosis or systemic autoimmune disease.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To perform a clinical description of CRION by analyzing a serie of patients with recurrent optic neuritis (ON).</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> A transversal study was carried out on patients who were selected for having recurring ON, at least two, after exclusion of demyelination and other autoimmune disorders. Clinical and demographic characteristics of the patients were analysed and described (age, sex, evolution period, number of recurrences, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), oligoclonal bands, AQP4 antibodies, MOG antibodies, antinuclear antibodies (ANA), angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and treatment).</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Out of the 18 patients initially tested, 16 fulfilled the selection criteria. Median age: 32 (13-56) years old, 62.5% were women, the average evolution period was 7.7 years. Median of total number of ON in all patients was 3.5 (2-7). 68.6% had a recurrence on steroid withdrawal. IgG oligoclonal bands were detected in two patients. MRI was normal in 62.5%, MRI that were not normal not meet criteria for multiple sclerosis. ANA positivity was found only in one patient, ACE was normal in all of them. AQP4 antibodies were negative in all patients, and MOG antibodies were positive in 4 patients. At the present time, seven patients of this serie are being treated with immunosuppressive treatment (IS) or Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), four of them had recurrences with another IS therapies before. Most patients received long-term and low dose corticosteroids.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> No specific laboratory or clinical criteria have been described for the diagnosis of CRION. Clinical indicators and relapse on steroid withdrawal is helpful. Anti-MOG antibodies have not been investigated in CRION patients to date, to our knowledge. We assessed the presence of MOG-IgG antibodies in the serum of 16 patients with recurrent ON, and these are detected in 4 of them, suggesting that MOG antibodies test may help identify these patients.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section364-1352458514547846"><title>P669</title><sec id="section365-1352458514547846"><title>Multimodal clinical trial paradigm to assess neuroprotection in optic neuritis: baseline data</title><p><underline>JB Mckee</underline><sup>1</sup>, CL Cottriall<sup>2</sup>, J Elston<sup>2</sup>, L Fugger<sup>3</sup>, C Kennard<sup>1</sup>, N Evangelou<sup>4</sup>, J Palace<sup>1</sup>, M Craner<sup>1</sup>, The ACTION Trial Group</p><p><sup>1</sup>University of Oxford, Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences, Oxford, United Kingdom, <sup>2</sup>Oxford Eye Hospital, Oxford, United Kingdom, <sup>3</sup>University of Oxford, Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, Oxford, United Kingdom, <sup>4</sup>University of Nottingham, Division of Clinical Neurology, Nottingham, United Kingdom</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Recent basic science experiments suggest that acid sensing ion channel blockade by amiloride is neuro- and myelo-protective in models of MS. The Amiloride Clinical Trial in Optic Neuritis (ACTION) has been recruiting since April 2013. The aim is to assess the neuroprotective efficacy of amiloride in acute optic neuritis.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To evaluate structural and electrophysiological correlates of the anterior visual system with clinical visual outcomes in the setting of acute optic neuritis, within a phase II neuroprotection trial.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Patients were recruited with a first episode of optic neuritis, and baseline assessments of vision, retinal nerve fibre layer thickness (RNFL), MRI brain and electrophysioslogy were performed.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> To date, 25 (76% female) participants have been recruited within a mean of 14.6 days from onset of visual symptoms. The presenting letter score visual acuity of the affected eye (mean &#x000b1; SD) was 52.5 &#x000b1; 30.4 letters, snellen equivalent of 20/100. RNFL as measured by scanning laser polarimetry (SLP) and optical coherence tomography (OCT), was significantly increased in the affected eyes (123 &#x000b1; 46.8&#x000b5; OCT, 57.4 &#x000b1; 7.14&#x000b5; SLP) compared to fellow eyes (99 &#x000b1; 10.6&#x000b5; OCT, 55 &#x000b1; 6.3&#x000b5; SLP) in both modalities (p0.01 OCT, p0.02 SLP). In our cohort, SLP thickness appears to have a significant positive correlation with letter score in affected eyes (r=0.537, p&#x0003c; 0.01). No comparable correlation was found in OCT measures.</p><p>All 25 patients had identifiable waveforms in pattern-electroretinogram (PERG). The N95 component was significantly lower (p&#x0003c; 0.01) in the affected eyes (4.1 &#x000b1; 1.5&#x000b5;V) compared to unaffected eyes (5.0 &#x000b1; 1.65&#x000b5;V). Pattern visual evoked potential (PVEP) waveforms were identified in 17/25 affected eyes. PVEP P100 time to peak was significantly (p&#x0003c; 0.01) delayed in the affected eyes (126 &#x000b1; 19ms) compared to the unaffected eyes (103 &#x000b1; 6.4ms). P100 amplitude was significantly lower (p&#x0003c; 0.01) in the affected eyes (8.3 &#x000b1; 5.14&#x000b5;V) compared to unaffected eyes (14.0 &#x000b1; 5.9 &#x000b5;V).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Initial analysis shows that PERG is more consistently recorded than the PVEP in acute optic neuritis. Inclusion of PERG increases electrophysiological data capture at baseline assessment in clinical trials of optic neuritis, and may provide useful structure-function information. SLP derived RNFL thickness, which is less confounded by swelling than OCT in the acute phase of optic neuritis, appears to have a significant correlation with vision in this preliminary analysis of our baseline data.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section366-1352458514547846"><title>P670</title><sec id="section367-1352458514547846"><title>Sector-specific macular volume compromise in relapsing &#x00026; remitting multiple sclerosis as measured by optical coherence tomography</title><p><underline>AS Fjeldstad</underline><sup>1</sup>, JW Rose<sup>1,2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>University of Utah, Neurology, Salt Lake City, UT, United States, <sup>2</sup>Neurovirology Research Lab, VA, Salt Lake City, UT, United States</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a non-invasive imaging technique that can quantify the layers of the retina and subsequent the total macular volume (TMV), which contains all neuronal retinal tissue. OCT has become increasingly popular in ophthalmology and in neurology examining diseases such as Multiple Sclerosis (MS). In addition, OCT is recognized as a potential marker for axonal loss and neurodegeneration.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To examine mean and sector macular volume in Relapsing-Remitting MS (RR-MS) patients with or without prior optic neuritis (ON), and compare the results to healthy controls.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> OCT measures of a total of 622 eyes from 311 subjects were evaluated and partitioned into the following groups; MS ON: 218 eyes from 109 patients with MS and previous ON (46%) (MS affected), 256 eyes from 128 patients with MS and with no previous ON (54%) (MS unaffected), and healthy controls: 148 eyes from 74 healthy controls. MS patients were relapse free for at least 6 months prior to the studies. Using OCT spectral domain and specialized software, TMV as well as inner, outer and center sector volumes can be measured around the macula.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> TMV was significantly higher in control (8.6 &#x000b1; 0.4 mm<sup>3</sup>) eyes relative to MS unaffected (8.4 &#x000b1; 0.4 mm<sup>3</sup>) and MS affected eyes (8.1 &#x000b1; 0.5 mm<sup>3</sup>) (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001). Inner macular volume was significantly higher in the control group (2.2 &#x000b1; 0.1 mm<sup>3</sup>) compared to MS unaffected (2.1 &#x000b1; 0.1 mm<sup>3</sup>) and MS affected groups (2.0 &#x000b1; 0.1 mm<sup>3</sup>) (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001). Similarly, the outer macular volume was significantly higher in the control eyes (6.3 &#x000b1; 0.3 mm<sup>3</sup>) relative to MS unaffected (6.1 &#x000b1; 0.3 mm<sup>3</sup>) and MS affected eyes (5.9 &#x000b1; 0.3 mm<sup>3</sup>) (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001). Controls were compared to MS unaffected and MS affected eyes, all eight sector volumes were significantly lower (<italic>p</italic> &#x02264; 0.013 and <italic>p</italic> &#x02264; 0.0001 respectively) in the MS groups. In addition, all individual sector volumes in the MS affected eyes versus the MS unaffected eyes (<italic>p</italic> &#x02264; 0.003) reached significance.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> TMV and all the sector volumes are reduced in RR-MS eyes compared to controls, and more so in the MS patients with prior history of ON. In addition, ON findings are consistent with a uniform neurodegeneration in the perimacular retina. Future OCT studies may focus on the TMV as well as the individual sector volumes as sensitive measures of neurodegeneration in MS and ON.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section368-1352458514547846"><title>P671</title><sec id="section369-1352458514547846"><title>The utility of optical coherence tomography in acute monocular visual loss: is it optic nerve or retina?</title><p><underline>RC Nolan</underline><sup>1</sup>, SC Beh<sup>1</sup>, LJ Balcer<sup>1</sup>, SL Galetta<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>NYU Langone Medical Center, Neurology, New York, NY, United States</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Acute monocular visual loss is common in multiple sclerosis (MS). Differential diagnoses include optic neuritis (ON), arteritic or non-arteritic ischemic optic neuropathy (AION/NAION), and central or branch retinal artery occlusion (CRAO/BRAO). Distinguishing ON from BRAO may be challenging because acute retinal whitening can be subtle and transient and optic atrophy may develop chronically from retrograde axonal degeneration.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> We present two patients referred to our center for optic neuropathy where spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) provided vital clues to help make the diagnosis of BRAO.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Exam, fundoscopy and vision testing were performed by a neuro-ophthalmologist. Visual fields (VF) and SD-OCT were performed by a trained technician. Careful evaluation of RNFL thickness, macular volume and retinal layer thickness using manually corrected automated segmentation algorithms was performed.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold></p><p><bold>Case 1:</bold> A 52 year old man with type I Gaucher&#x02019;s disease and acute monocular visual loss in his left eye was referred with a diagnosis of optic neuritis. Examination revealed reduced visual acuity, color impairment, a paracentral VF defect and a normal appearing optic nerve. Static perimetry showed superior paracentral scotoma. SD-OCT imaging (Cirrus; Zeiss) showed temporal inferior macular elevation consistent with acute BRAO. MRI of the brain and orbits revealed a left internal carotid dissection.</p><p><bold>Case 2:</bold> A 55-year old man with a diagnosis of NAION and history of a thoracic dissecting aortic aneurysm 2 years prior was referred for evaluation of optic disc atrophy and a superior nasal defect in the left eye. Exam revealed normal acuity with a left afferent pupillary defect and segmental atrophy of the lower part of the left optic nerve. SD-OCT(Spectralis; Heidelberg) showed marked thinning of the inferior temporal macula and inner layer architecture disruption. Using proprietary segmentation software, severe loss of ganglion cell, inner plexiform, and bipolar cell layers in the inferior temporal macula was observed. Strikingly, the photoreceptor layer thickness was intact. These findings on OCT were most consistent with left BRAO, not NAION.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> OCT imaging of macular layers can help distinguish optic neuropathy, a common finding in MS, from a primary retinal process for which the treatment and patient management are drastically different. It is important to obtain images of both the RNFL of MS patients and the macula to rule out retinal causes of acute vision loss.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section370-1352458514547846"><title>P672</title><sec id="section371-1352458514547846"><title>Vogt Koyanagi Harada disease, our experience</title><p><underline>V Nogueira Fern&#x000e1;ndez</underline><sup>1</sup>, L &#x000c1;lvarez Fern&#x000e1;ndez<sup>1</sup>, C Da Silva Fran&#x000e7;a<sup>1</sup>, L Ramos R&#x000fa;a<sup>1</sup>, M Rodr&#x000ed;guez Rodr&#x000ed;guez<sup>1</sup>, M Alberte Woodward<sup>1</sup>, J Gonz&#x000e1;lez Ardura<sup>1</sup>, R Pego Reigosa<sup>1</sup>, F Bra&#x000f1;as Fern&#x000e1;ndez<sup>1</sup>, M Guijarro Del Amo<sup>1</sup>, JA Cort&#x000e9;s La&#x000ed;&#x000f1;o<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Hospital Universitario Lucus Augusti, Lugo, Spain</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Vogt Koyanagi Harada disease (VKHD) is a rare autoinmune disease in which the main target are melanocytes, mainly ones in the uvea and the central nervous system (CNS). The clinical presentation is characterized by uveitis, aseptic meningitis, hearing loss and sometimes vitiligo and poliosis. It has no specific markers and white matter lesions are found in neuroimaging.

In any patient with aseptic meningitis, white matter lesions and hearing loss or vertigo, VKHD should be suspected.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section372-1352458514547846"><title>P673</title><sec id="section373-1352458514547846"><title>Comparing two and three way receiver operating characterization (ROC) analyses for optic neuritis transfer function characterization</title><p>SH Choudhury<sup>1</sup>, B Goodyear<sup>1</sup>, <underline>F Costello</underline><sup>2,3,4</sup>, F Cortese<sup>5</sup>, MR Smith<sup>1</sup>, Calgary Optic Neuritis Study Group (CORE)</p><p><sup>1</sup>University of Calgary, Electrical and Computer Engineering, Calgary, AB, Canada, <sup>2</sup>University of Calgary, Clinical Neurosciences, Calgary, AB, Canada, <sup>3</sup>Hotchkiss Brain Institute, Calgary, AB, Canada, <sup>4</sup>University of Calgary, Surgery, Calgary, AB, Canada, <sup>5</sup>University of Calgary, Radiology, Calgary, AB, Canada</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Optic neuritis (ON) represents a single-lesion model to explore multiple sclerosis (MS). Functional magnetic resonance imaging transfer function (fMRI-TF) measures the resting state (no-activity) gain between different brain regions that are correlated in visual activity. fMRI-TF offers a route to generate useful markers for identifying the cortical contribution to recovery from ON.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To evaluate the predictive capability of fMRI-TF markers applied in (1) a two analysis to distinguish between healthy persons and ON patients; and (2) a three way analysis to distinguish between healthy persons, ON patients with relapsing remitting MS (RRMS) and ON patients with a clinically isolated syndrome (CIS).</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> In this prospective cohort study, resting state fMRI data was collected from 21 patients (11 CIS; 10 RRMS) and 12 age-matched healthy volunteers using T2*-weighted echo planar fMRI images. A feed-forward propagation of visual information was assumed, between the lateral geniculate nuclei (LGN) and the primary visual cortex (V1) so that fMRI-TF = DFT(V1) / DFT(LGN) where DFT is the discrete Fourier transform. Power spectral ratios were calculated for several frequency bands.

Power transfer was highest in healthy subjects, followed by patients with MS and then patients with CIS in the three way ROC analysis for LGN to V1 propagation in the 0-0.1Hz region. However the three way ROC differentiates patient groups a predictive level of <italic>VUS</italic> = 0.46, less than the two-way.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Both two way and three way ROC results suggest that ON TF analysis has potential in identifying ON presence. Methods, such as artificial neural networks, are needed to combine fMRI-TF results from multiple visual pathways, to boost transfer function metric accuracy. Bootstrap analysis approaches are being used to provide reliability estimates. The current base-line results are to be compared to 6 month results to determine if fMRI-TF measures can track ON recovery.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section374-1352458514547846"><title>P674</title><sec id="section375-1352458514547846"><title>25-hydroxyvitamin D levels in acute optic neuritis.

Optic neuritis is a common first symptom of MS and only few studies have so far investigated vitamin D at this early stage of the disease.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To examine 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25HVITD) levels in patients in the acute phase of optic neuritis (ON) with comparisons to a general MS population and to determine whether 25HVITD levels in acute ON are associated with paraclinical findings (MRI and CSF findings) suggestive of MS and with risk of RRMS.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> A cross-sectional study of 25HVITD levels in ON (n=165) and MS (n=948) with retrospective follow-up of the ON patients. Mean 25HVITD differences and differences in prevalence of 25HVITD deficiency (&#x0003c; 50nmol/L) between ON and MS (two-sample t-test, chi-square test) were examined. Associations between 25HVITD levels, paraclinical findings and demographic characteristics in ON patients (logistic regression) and hazards of MS development (cox regression analysis) were assessed. In all analysis deseasonalized 25HVITD levels were employed and adjustment was made for possible confounders.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Mean levels were 47.7 (ON) and 63.9 (MS) nmol/L (p&#x0003c; 0.0001) and a significantly higher prevalence of 25HVITD deficiency in ON (56 % vs. 35%)(p&#x0003c; 0.0001), most pronounced in females, was shown. In the acute ON 25HVITD levels were associated with increased odds of paraclinical findings suggestive of MS i.e. MS-type lesions on MRI (OR: 0.984 [95 % CI: 0.970-0.998], p:0.037) and presence of elevated igG index in CSF (OR: 0.979 [0.961-0.997], p:0.018) although not significant with regards to presence of oligoclonal bands (OR:0.990 [0.976-1.005], p:0.208). 23 ON patients developed MS during the study. Univariate and multivariate survival analysis showed a trend towards decreased hazard of MS with increasing 25HVITD levels albeit insignificant (HR: 0.987 [0.968;1.006], p:0.202 and HR: 0.988 [0.969;1.007], p:0.217 respectively).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The present study shows for the first time in patients in the acute phase of ON an association between vitamin D levels and paraclinical findings suggestive of MS.

No significant association between 25HVITD levels and risk of MS was shown in acute ON.

Whereas MS is thought to be a T cell mediated disease against myelin, NMO&#x02019;s pathophysiologic hallmark are antibodies against aquaporin-4, an astrocytic water channel. Within the retinal nerve fiber layer astrocytes are mainly concentrated in the optic nerve head (ONH), which lead us to hypothesize that the optic nerve head volume and the peripheral retinal nerve fiber layer might be differentially affected in both diseases.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To compare ONH volume and RNFL thickness as markers for optic neurodegeneration in eyes with a history of optic neuritis in NMO and relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS).</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Seventy-one patients with a history of optic neuritis (49 RRMS and 22 NMO) and 39 healthy controls underwent retinal optical coherence tomography. RNFL was measured with a standard peripapillary ring scan. ONH volume (ONHV) and ONH excavation volume (ECV) were determined from 3D ONH volume scans with a custom protocol (145 B-scans, scanning angle of 15&#x000b0;x15&#x000b0;, 384 A-scans per B-scan) and a custom built algorithm. Statistical analysis was performed with Generalized Estimating Equation models (GEE) and linear regression models (LR).</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> ONHV was significantly reduced in patients&#x02019; eyes with a history of optic neuritis in comparison to patients&#x02019; eyes without in MS (B=0.295, p&#x0003c; 0.001, GEE) and NMO (B=0.700, p&#x0003c; 0.001, GEE). Similarly, ECV was significantly increased. ONHV was significantly stronger affected in ON eyes from NMO patients than in MS (B=0.278, p=0.030, GEE). ONHV correlated well with RNFL in MS (r=0.601, p&#x0003c; 0.001, LR) and NMO (r=0.623, p&#x0003c; 0.001, LR). Neither association differed significantly in offset or slope. However, in NMO three eyes showed a higher ONHV in comparison to RNFL than would have been expected from the models.

However, multiple episodes of optic neuritis (ON) result in cumulative severe reduction of RNFLT, making differentiation of these two diseases difficult.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> In this study, we compared the visual functions and retinal thickness measure by OCT in the eyes with single episode of ON in NMO or MS to discriminate the diseases in early phase.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Total 111 subjects (73 patients with NMO and 38 patients with MS) without recent ON events within 3 months underwent neuro-ophthalmic evaluation, including best corrective high contrast visual acuity (HCVA), low contrast visual acuity (LCVA), RNFLT, and total macular volume (MV) by optical coherence tomography (OCT).</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> There were 60 eyes of NMO and 33 eyes of MS with single episode of ON among 101 affected eyes of NMO and 38 affected eyes of MS. With single episode of ON, HCVA and RNFLT were decreased significantly more in NMO than MS (p &#x0003c; 0.001). However, when NMO eyes with single episode of ON and MS eyes with multiple episodes of ON were compared, HCVA and RNFLT were not significantly different. In a patient after first episode of ON, RNFLT of less than 78.9 &#x000b5;m suggests the possibility of NMO with 93.9% specificity, and RNFLT of less than 78.9 &#x000b5;m with HCVA of less than 0.35 decimal were 100% specific for NMO.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Evaluation of eyes with single episode of ON has an advantage on detecting the differences of insult on optic nerves by NMO or MS because multiple episodes of ON obscure the disease specific changes. There was significantly more severe axonal injury in optic nerves caused by NMO than MS after the first episode of ON, which could establish cutoff value. This study suggests that peripapillary RNFLT value and HCVA after first episode of ON can help us to differentiate ON of NMO from MS in early phase.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section382-1352458514547846"><title>P678</title><sec id="section383-1352458514547846"><title>Longitudinal time-domain optic coherence study of retinal nerve fiber layer of IFN&#x003b2;-treated and untreated MS patients</title><p><underline>R Pul</underline><sup>1</sup>, M Sadat<sup>2</sup>, F Morbiducci<sup>1</sup>, T Skripuletz<sup>1</sup>, &#x000dc; Pul<sup>3</sup>, D Brockmann<sup>4</sup>, K-W S&#x000fc;hs<sup>1</sup>, M Stangel<sup>1</sup>, C Trebst<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Medical School Hannover, Department of Neurology, Hannover, Germany, <sup>2</sup>Medical School Hannover, Department of Neuroradiology, Hannover, Germany, <sup>3</sup>University Hospital Essen, Department of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery, Essen, Germany, <sup>4</sup>Medical School Hannover, Department of Ophthalmology, Hannover, Germany</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Quantification of the retinal nerve fiber layer by optical coherence tomography (OCT) is proposed to provide an indirect appraisal for retinal axonal loss.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> This prospective longitudinal OCT study was aimed to find evidence whether interferon beta (IFN&#x003b2;) treatment impedes retinal axonal loss.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> We enrolled a total of 96 eyes from 48 patients with multiple sclerosis (48 IFN&#x003b2;-1b-treated and 48 untreated eyes) and 24 eyes from 12 healthy controls.

Recent studies of cortical pathology in secondary progressive MS (SPMS) have shown that a more severe clinical course and the presence of extensive subpial GM lesions (GMLs) with significant neuronal/glia loss and microglial activation are associated with diffuse inflammation and lymphoid-like structures in the subarachnoid space.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> We investigated the hypothesis that inflammatory/cytotoxic molecules diffusing from the meninges lead to pathological changes in signalling pathways within the underlying GM that could explain the extensive pathology.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> By using Illumina HumanRef8 Beadchip arrays, we defined differentially expressed genes/pathways in subpial GMLs and normal appearing GM (NAGM) of the motor cortex from 20 post-mortem MS brains with and without meningeal inflammation and 10 non-neurological controls, previously characterised for cellular pathology (Magliozzi et al, Ann. Neurol. 2010). Real time RT-PCR was used to verify changes in gene expression, while Western-blot analysis and immunohistochemical techniques (IHC/IFC) were performed to validate the expression and cell source of molecules of interest.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Gene expression profiling of GMLs and NAGM not only confirmed the substantial GM pathological cell changes, but also demonstrated the upregulation of multiple genes/pathways associated with the inflammatory response. In particular, genes involved in TNF mediated apoptosis/survival signalling were found to be significantly deregulated in MS cases compared to controls. In particular, increased meningeal inflammation was associated with a shift in the balance of TNF signalling away from the TNFR2 and NFkB anti-apoptotic pathway towards TNFR1 mediated RIP1/RIP3 dependent pro-apoptotic and necroptotic signalling. Western blot analysis confirmed the differential protein expression of TNFR1/TNFR2 in the GM of SPMS linked to meningeal inflammation. Furthermore, IHC/IFC showed the expression of TNFR1 predominantly by oligodendrocytes and neurons and of TNFR2 mainly by astrocytes in the same GM areas and MS cases.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> These results support the hypothesis that the inflammatory milieu, generated in the subarachnoid space by leptomeningeal immune cell infiltration, has a fundamental role in the genesis of subpial GM pathology in progressive MS and that TNF may be a key mediator of cortical tissue damage.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section389-1352458514547846"><title>P681</title><sec id="section390-1352458514547846"><title>The relationship between axonal loss and demyelination in the MS spinal cord</title><p><underline>D Carassiti</underline><sup>1</sup>, N Petrova<sup>1</sup>, S Al-Zawawi<sup>1</sup>, F Scaravilli<sup>1</sup>, K Schmierer<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Queen Mary University London, Experimental Medicine, Neuroscience and Trauma, London, United Kingdom</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory and neurodegenerative disease affecting the whole central nervous system (CNS). Limb dysfunction due to damage and loss of cortico-spinal tracts (CSTs) axons is common among people with MS (pwMS). The relationship between demyelination and CST axon remains unclear, possibly due to variation in sampling techniques.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To accurately quantify the loss of CST axons in the MS spinal cord and assess its relationship with demyelination.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Formalin fixed spinal cords of nine people with secondary progressive MS (5 women and 4 men, age = 62 &#x000b1; 3 years, disease duration= 24 &#x000b1; 3 years) and three reference cases (2 women and 1 man, age= 84 &#x000b1; 8 years) with no known neurological disease were studied. Spinal cords were dissected into &#x02248;0.5 cm thick axial tissue blocks across the entire length (total no. of blocks = 294). Sequential 10&#x000b5;m-thick sections were stained for myelin basic protein (MBP) to identify demyelinated areas and SMI-31 to identify axons using established protocols. Images of axons in four microscopic fields (40x), randomly cast on each lateral CST area, were acquired and then quantified using ImageJ software. The density of axons in each CST was estimated bilaterally as the density of axons inside the counting fields multiplied by the corresponding cross-sectional CST area in mm<sup>2</sup>.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Reduction in CST axonal density in pwMS was 62% (p &#x0003c; 0.0001), 49% (p &#x0003c; 0.0001), and 50% (p = 0.0018) at cervical, thoracic and lumbar level respectively. The percentage of demyelinated grey matter (GM) was significantly higher than in white matter (WM): 26% and 11% (p = 0.012), 47% and 12% (p &#x0003c; 0.0001), 13% and 3% (p = 0.032) at cervical, thoracic and lumbar level, respectively. A moderate negative correlation was detected between the density of axons and the extent of demyelination at cervical level only (r= &#x02212;0.2456, p= 0.05).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Comprehensive sampling is required to draw more definitive conclusions about the relationship between major components of pathology in the MS spinal cord. We observed axonal loss of at least 49% throughout the spinal cord, however only at the cervical level was with loss - moderately - associated with demyelination. Wallerian or tract specific degeneration may explain lack of association at lower cord levels. Further work is underway to explore these mechanisms and to correlate these findings in the spinal cord with cortical demyelination and neuronal loss in the brain.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section391-1352458514547846"><title>P682</title><sec id="section392-1352458514547846"><title>Astrocytes upregulate interleukin-17 receptor expression in white matter lesions in multiple sclerosis</title><p><underline>J Raffel</underline><sup>1</sup>, R Nicholas<sup>1</sup>, F Roncaroli<sup>1</sup>, R Reynolds<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Imperial College, London, United Kingdom</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Interleukin-17 (IL17) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine, produced by T helper 17 cells, that has recently attracted attention for its putative role in disease pathogenesis in multiple sclerosis (MS). In humans, post-mortem tissue studies in MS have shown expression of IL17 in areas of active demyelination. However, the target cells of IL17 in the brain in MS have not yet been identified.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To identify the cells that express IL17 receptor A (IL17RA) and IL17 receptor B (IL17RB), and to study their distribution, in post-mortem brain tissue in MS and non-MS controls.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> 52 post-mortem brain tissue blocks from 21 patients with MS and 5 non-MS controls were studied using immunohistochemistry. The phenotype of IL17R+ cells was determined using double immunofluorescence; using primary antibodies against IL17RA, IL17RB, MOG, Iba-1, GFAP, S100B, Olig-2, CD8, CD20, CD3, NeuN, and NF-L. The density of IL17-R+ cells was then compared between active demyelinating lesions, chronic-active demyelinating lesions, inactive demyelinating lesions, normal appearing white matter, grey matter lesions, and normal appearing grey matter.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Abundant IL17R+ cells were found in MS white matter, but not in non-MS controls (p&#x0003c; 0.01). The vast majority of these cells were S100B/GFAP+ astrocytes. The distribution of IL17R+ astrocytes matched exactly the distribution of white matter lesions. The number of IL17R+ astrocytes was greatest in active demyelinating lesions, followed by chronic-active lesions, followed by inactive lesions, with very few found in normal appearing white matter (p&#x0003c; 0.01). IL17R+ astrocytes were not present in grey matter lesions, or in normal appearing grey matter. Surprisingly, IL17R+ staining was also observed in occasional axons in the most actively demyelinating white matter lesions. IL17R+ neuronal cell bodies were present in both grey matter lesions and normal appearing grey matter, in both MS cases, and non-MS controls.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> This study provides evidence that astrocytes are the main target cells for IL17 in the MS white matter lesion. Moreover, the distribution of IL17R+ astrocytes appears closely related to the demyelinating and inflammatory activity, suggesting a role in the pathophysiology. In addition, this study provides evidence of IL17R staining on neurons. The precise function of IL17 signalling in the MS white matter lesion requires further study in order to determine the potential effects of anti-IL17 therapeutics.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section393-1352458514547846"><title>P683</title><sec id="section394-1352458514547846"><title>Induction of ion channel and transporter transcripts in normal appearing grey matter of chronic multiple sclerosis patients</title><p><underline>R Klaver</underline><sup>1</sup>, P Nijland<sup>2</sup>, GJ Schenk<sup>1</sup>, P Van der Valk<sup>3</sup>, J Van Horssen<sup>2</sup>, HE De Vries<sup>2</sup>, JJG Geurts<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>VU University Medical Center, Anatomy &#x00026; Neuroscience, Amsterdam, Netherlands, <sup>2</sup>VU University Medical Center, Molecular Cell Biology &#x00026; Immunology, Amsterdam, Netherlands, <sup>3</sup>VU University Medical Center, Pathology, Amsterdam, Netherlands</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Although grey matter (GM) pathology correlates with the progression of multiple sclerosis (MS), the question remains how does GM pathology arise?

Based on anti-proteolipid protein (PLP) immunohistochemistry, frozen normally myelinated NAGM cingulate cortex from 5 chronic MS cases and 5 controls cases were selected for real time quantitative PCR arrays. Three RT<sup>2</sup> profiler PCR arrays (Qiagen) were used to examine mRNA levels of genes involved in ion channels &#x00026; transporters, neurotrophins &#x00026; receptors and synaptic plasticity. Data was normalized with housekeepings genes with the most consistent expression in all samples and significant differences in gene expression were investigated using Student&#x02019;s t-test.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Expression of genes coding for ion channels and transporters were markedly increased.

PRKG1, also known as cGMP dependent protein kinase type 1 has been shown to promote long-term potentiation (LTP) via CREB phosphorylation, probably by increasing intracellular Ca2+. Interestingly, neurotrophins and neurotrophin receptors were not differently regulated in MS cortex compared to controls.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> So far, the qPCR array results suggest a downregulation of genes involved in synaptic plasticity and an upregulation of genes encoding ion channels and transporters in NAGM.

Stimulation of these cells <italic>in vitro</italic> with CLEC-2 promoted proliferation and a shift away from a Th17 phenotype. We have previously shown that salt promotes Th17 induction and may represent a risk factor for MS.

Moreover, CLEC-2 signaling through PDPN enhances T cell proliferation and decreases Th17 differentiation. Thus, in inflamed CNS, CLEC-2 and galectin-8 may signal through PDPN to regulate Th17-associated inflammation. Our work suggests a dual mechanism for PDPN that could be exploited therapeutically for the treatment of MS patients.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section397-1352458514547846"><title>P685</title><sec id="section398-1352458514547846"><title>Epigenetic changes control memory function following demyelination in multiple sclerosis</title><p>A Chomyk<sup>1</sup>, S Deckhard<sup>1</sup>, RJ Fox<sup>2</sup>, BD Trapp<sup>1</sup>, <underline>R Dutta</underline><sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Cleveland Clinic, Neuroscience, Cleveland, OH, United States, <sup>2</sup>Cleveland Clinic, Mellen Center for MS Research, Cleveland, OH, United States</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is an immune-mediated demyelinating disease of the human central nervous system.

In this study we examined epsilon toxin binding and toxicity in primary CNS cultures and in organotypic cerebellar slice explants.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> In primary cultures of enriched mouse oligodendrocytes, astrocytes or microglia, specific binding of epsilon toxin only occurs with oligodendrocytes. Similarly, epsilon toxin is a potent inducer of oligodendrocyte cell death in a dose dependent fashion but has no effect on astrocytes or microglia. The effects of epsilon toxin on the oligodendrocyte lineage are dependent on maturation as epsilon toxin neither binds nor is toxic to oligodendrocyte progenitor cells. Cerebellar slice explants maintain the normal cytoarchitecture of the CNS including spatial and temporal patterns of myelination. Fully myelinated cerebellar explants treated with epsilon toxin show dose and time dependent specific death of oligodendrocytes and demyelination with preservation of neurons, astrocytes and microglia. Neutralizing antibodies to epsilon toxin protect against toxin mediated oligodendrocyte death and demyelination.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> In the CNS <italic>Clostridium perfringens</italic> epsilon toxin specifically targets oligodendrocytes and myelin leading to demyelination with preservation of other neural elements. In conjunction with its specificity for CNS endothelial cells, the actions of epsilon toxin are fully compatible with the know targets identified in newly forming lesions: blood-brain barrier and oligodendrocytes. Since epsilon toxin enters the CNS from the blood stream this pathophysiologic step is consistent with the vasocentric concept of new lesion formation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section401-1352458514547846"><title>P687</title><sec id="section402-1352458514547846"><title>Postmortem MRI to guide pathological localization: individualized, 3D-printed cutting boxes for fixed brains</title><p><underline>M Absinta</underline><sup>1,2</sup>, N Govind<sup>1</sup>, M Filippi<sup>2</sup>, A Ray-Chaudhury<sup>3</sup>, MI Reyes-Mantilla<sup>4</sup>, CA Pardo<sup>4</sup>, DS Reich<sup>1,4</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Translational Neuroradiology Unit, National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Bethesda, MD, United States, <sup>2</sup>Neuroimaging Research Unit, Institute of Experimental Neurology, Division of Neuroscience, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Vita-Salute San Raffaele University, Milan, Italy, <sup>3</sup>Surgical Neurology Branch, National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Bethesda, MD, United States, <sup>4</sup>Department of Neurology, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, United States</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Interfacing MRI and pathology is critically important to understand the pathological basis of MRI signal changes in vivo and for clinicopathological correlation. Postmortem MRI is an intermediate step in this process, but unfortunately relating the data to standard hand-cut pathological sections, which are relatively thick and often non-parallel, is both time-consuming and insufficiently accurate. This represents a major limitation in performing radiology-pathology correlational studies.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To develop technology to integrate postmortem, high-resolution, whole-brain MRI into the planning and execution of the pathological analysis through precise localization of the target and coordinates of cut.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> We built customized, 3D-printed cutting boxes for formalin-fixed whole-brains. According to specific findings of interest, the position, orientation, and thickness of each slab were determined a priori and designed using 7tesla postmortem MRI images. Three brains were donated for research purposes (two patients affected by multiple sclerosis and one by anti-NMDA-r encephalitis): two were sectioned using customized cutting boxes (Pat1 and 3) and, for comparison, one brain underwent the standard pathological sectioning (Pat2).</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> There was a marked improvement in uniformity of thickness (6mm vs.~1cm) and skewness of the slabs obtained with the cutting box compared to the traditional sectioning method: the match with the MRI was judged to be not accurate, respectively, in ~25% (Pat1 and 3) vs. 86% slab surfaces (Pat2). Outstanding results were achieved with a cutting box customized for the brainstem-cerebellum (Pat1). MRI targets of interest were correctly localized after the cutting box-guided sectioning and characterized histologically for further research purposes (demyelinated lesions in Pat1 and hippocampi in Pat3).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Compared to standard pathological sectioning, the use of individualized, 3D-printed cutting boxes, designed based on postmortem MRI of fixed whole-brains, improves the speed, quality, and accuracy of radio-pathological correlation, and specifically the histopathological localization of imaging findings. This technology is easily implemented and applicable to any brain disorder. From the point of view of the pathologist, this technique can improve localization of small abnormalities, whereas from the point of view of the radiologist, it has the potential to improve understanding of MRI signal changes observed in disease.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section403-1352458514547846"><title>P688</title><sec id="section404-1352458514547846"><title>S100B levels are increased in multiple sclerosis and modulates demyelination, glial reactivity and inflammation</title><p>A Barateiro<sup>1</sup>, V Afonso<sup>1</sup>, S Gisela<sup>1</sup>, JJ Cerqueira<sup>2</sup>, D Brites<sup>1,3</sup>, J van Horssen<sup>4</sup>, <underline>A Fernandes</underline><sup>1,3</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Research Institute for Medicines, Lisboa, Portugal, <sup>2</sup>University of Minho, School of Health Sciences, Life and Health Sciences Research Institute (ICVS), Braga, Portugal, <sup>3</sup>Faculdade de Farm&#x000e1;cia, Universidade de Lisboa, Biochemistry and Human Biology, Lisboa, Portugal, <sup>4</sup>VU University Medical Center, Department of Molecular Cell Biology and Immunology, Amsterdam, Netherlands</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> S100B was identified in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and post-mortem brain tissue of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients and correlated with glia reactivity upon demyelination. Although S100B is seen as an astrogliosis marker it is also expressed by maturing oligodendrocytes and is necessary for their differentiation into myelinating cells. Interestingly, S100B has neurotrophic properties at low levels, but its increase upon injury may induce glial reactivity and tissue damage.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> We aimed to unravel the role of S100B as a biomarker and therapeutic target in MS.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> S100B levels were detected in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of MS patients by ELISA and S100B and its receptor RAGE expression were analyzed in post-mortem samples of MS patients by immunohistochemistry. We induced demyelination in cerebellar organotypic slice cultures (COSC) using lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) and evaluated the release of S100B by ELISA. S100B action was inhibited by anti-S100B, the extent of demyelination and glial reactivity were assayed by immunohistochemistry and expression of inflammatory mediators HMGB1 and IL-18 by qRT-PCR.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> S100B was significantly elevated in CSF samples from MS patients at diagnosis (&#x0003e;1.6-fold, p&#x0003c; 0.05, Mann-Whitney test). Active MS lesions showed increased S100B and RAGE expressions, while chronic lesions displayed S100B expression in demyelinated areas with a much lower expression of RAGE in the rim. Interestingly, reactive astrocytes were identified as the predominant cellular source of S100B, whereas RAGE was mainly expressed by activated microglia/macrophages in active lesions. Treatment of COSC with LPC induced a marked elevation of S100B (~5-fold, p&#x0003c; 0.01), which co-localized mostly with astrocytes. Inhibition of S100B action reduced LPC-induced demyelination by more than 20% (p&#x0003c; 0.01), prevented astrocyte reactivity and promoted microglia migration to demyelination areas. In parallel, anti-S100B abrogated the expression of HMGB1 and IL-18 (p&#x0003c; 0.01) to control levels.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our data suggest that S100B may be a potential new biomarker for MS diagnosis given its high production during disease episodes and its presence in active MS lesions. Moreover, S100B may also be a potential therapeutic target to reduce damage during the course of MS, based on the beneficial outcome of its inhibition in COSC studies.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section405-1352458514547846"><title>P689</title><sec id="section406-1352458514547846"><title>Enrichment of retroviral sequences in brain tissue from patients with progressive multiple sclerosis</title><p><underline>JD Kriesel</underline><sup>1</sup>, PJ Bhetariya<sup>1</sup>, BK Chan<sup>1,2</sup>, TA Wilson<sup>3</sup>, KF Fischer<sup>3</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>University of Utah, Internal Medicine, Salt Lake City, UT, United States, <sup>2</sup>Yale University, Biology, New Haven, CT, United States, <sup>3</sup>University of Utah, Pathology, Salt Lake City, UT, United States</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Our group has used deep sequencing to identify viral RNA signatures in frozen human brain specimens.

Deep sequencing of total RNA extracted from 12 primary progressive MS, 2 neuromyelitis optica, and 14 normal control frozen brain specimens was performed using the Illumina HiSeq 2000 instrument.

Sequence comparisons revealed numerous significant HR differences for several HERV domains and retroelements. Clustered average HRs of retroviral domains (i.e. GAG, ENV, RT, etc.) discriminated MS from control specimens (P=0.009). Based on overexpression in the MS samples, 16 different MS candidate GAG and ENV domains have been selected for follow up investigation.

The disability was evaluated using the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) and the disease activity was evaluated using the resonance magnetic imaging (RMI). Cytokines were measured by a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; hydroperoxide (CL-LOOH) was evaluated by chemiluminescence; Advanced Oxidation Protein Products (AOPP) was determined using the semi-automated method; carbonyl protein was measured as an estimate of protein oxidative injury; sulfhydryl groups of proteins were evaluated by a spectrophotometric assay; nitric oxide metabolites (NOx) levels were assessed by nitrite and nitrate concentration, and total radical-trapping antioxidant parameter (TRAP) was determined by chemiluminescence.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Progressive MS patients differed from RRMS patients in disease duration, EDSS, and increased disease activity (p&#x0003c; 0.0001). Progressive MS patients presented increased levels of IL-1B (p=0.0168) and IFNG (p=0.0374), and low levels of IL-12 (p=0.0006) than RRMS patients; and predominance of cytokines with Th1 profile on Th2 profile (IFNG/IL4, p=0.0033; IFNG/IL-10:p&#x0003c; 0.0001). The multivariate analysis showed that IFNG was independently associated with the progressive clinical forms (p=0.0105). Regarding the oxidative stress markers, patients with progressive clinical forms presented increased levels of hydroperoxide (p=0.0408), NOx (p=0.0327), AOPP (p=0.0141), and carbonyl protein (p=0.0195). Regarding the antioxidant defense, they presented decrease TRAP (p=0.0489).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> This study revealed a complex cytokine network and redox state imbalance among patients, that was correlated with a progressive clinical course. Oxidative stress may be able to initiate a cascade of reactions affecting the function of several proteins that progressively become impaired and eventually culminate in relapse outburst. At this level, severe disability and inflammatory events occur and oxidative damage seems to affect inflammatory pathways. Given the central role of oxidative damage in the pathogenesis of MS, this mechanism might represent key targets for future neuroprotective therapies in patients with the disease.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section409-1352458514547846"><title>P691</title><sec id="section410-1352458514547846"><title>Neuropathological study of glucose and monocarboxylate transporters in multiple sclerosis</title><p><underline>K Masaki</underline><sup>1</sup>, SO Suzuki<sup>2</sup>, M Watanabe<sup>1</sup>, S Sato<sup>1</sup>, T Matsushita<sup>1</sup>, M Suzuki<sup>3</sup>, T Iwaki<sup>2</sup>, J-I Kira<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Kyushu University, Neurology, Fukuoka, Japan, <sup>2</sup>Kyushu University, Neuropathology, Fukuoka, Japan, <sup>3</sup>Hamamatsu University School of Medicine, Hamamatsu, Japan</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Recently, energy supply to axons via glial cells has received a lot of attention in the world. Nutritional substances such as glucose and lactate are transferred from blood vessel to axons via connexins (Cxs) gap junction or glucose transporters (GLUTs) and monocarboxylate transporter (MCTs). We previously reported extensive loss of astrocytic and oligodendrocytic Cxs in active lesions of multiple sclerosis (MS), neuromyelitis optica (NMO) and Bal&#x000f3;&#x02019;s disease (BD), suggesting early disruption of Cxs may cause the extensive energy failure and contribute to the pathogenesis in demyelinating disorders.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To get more understanding of metabolic condition in demyelinating disorders, we studied the expression of GLUTs and MCTs in MS lesion.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> We pathologically evaluated GLUT1, 3, 4, 5 and MCT1, 2, 4 expression relative to expressions of Cx43, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), extent of demyelination determined by MAG, MBP, MOG, and Nogo-A (oligodendrocyte marker) immunoreactivities, neurofilament and amyloid precursor protein (APP) (axonal markers), and lesion staging with CD68 staining for macrophages in six autopsied cases with MS including one case of Marburg&#x02019;s type and 20 with other neurological diseases.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> In myasthenia gravis case, GLUT1 and MCT1 were abundantly expressed in the microvascular endothelial cells and glial cells. GLUT3 and MCT2 were mainly expressed in axons. GLUT5 was specifically expressed in resting microglia. MCT4 was expressed in astrocytes and perivascular foot processes. In the active demyelinating lesion of MS, in spite of massive perivascular lymphocytic cuffing, endothelial MCT1 and GLUT1 were relatively preserved. On the other hand, immunoreactivity for MCT4 was diminished in the perivascular foot processes in active lesion. Microglial GLUT5 was up-regulated in activated microglia and foamy macrophages in active lesion. Immunoreactivity for APP was found in damaged axons and terminal axonal ovoids. Similar to APP, immunoreactivity for GLUT3 was also emphasized in damaged axons.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our findings indicate that altered expression of GLUTs and MCTs could be seen in active MS lesion and may cause energy failure in early stage of MS. Especially, loss of MCT4 in astrocytic foot process may cause impaired transportation of energy to axons via glial cells. GLUT3 was accumulated in damaged axons of active MS lesions and immunostaining for GLUT3 may be useful as a novel potential marker for damaged axons.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section411-1352458514547846"><title>P692</title><sec id="section412-1352458514547846"><title>Is inflammation atherogenic in neurological diseases?

Due to its specific pathology, it is suggested that the use of brain connectivity based metrics to assess cognitive impairment may be highly beneficial.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> The aim of this research is to detect cognitive impairment in an MS population based on the trial averaged EEG response to the infrequent (target) stimuli and to assess the informative value provided by different connectivity metrics.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Cognitive impairment was defined as failing 2 or more tests included in the Neuropsychological Screening Battery for MS (NSBMS). Failing one test was defined as failing the 5<sup>th</sup> percentile of a normal population. A total of 167 patients resulted as cognitively preserved, 104 patients were cognitively intact.</p><p>The EEG signals were recorded on 21 electrodes following the standard 10/20-system. The infrequent stimuli evoke a large positive wave at about 300 ms after the stimuli (the P300). Two sets of features were selected, the first one included the more traditional P300 features like amplitude and latency of the P300 peak. The other set considered connectivity metrics.</p><p>Every connectivity metric results in a network in which the nodes are the electrodes and the edges are e.g. given by the correlation between every pair of electrodes. The information included in several frequently used connectivity measures (correlation, coherence, phase-lag-index, partial correlation, the imaginary part of coherency) is compared by entering all edges as input features of a support vector machine (SVM).</p><p>This SVM is subsequently optimized in a tenfold cross-validation scheme. A null-distribution of the accuracy is obtained by repeating this procedure 100 times with randomly reshuffled cognition labels.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> We show that correlation, correlation in the frequency domain and delta and theta-coherence bear significant information on a patient&#x02019;s cognitive status (p&#x0003c; 0.01). The obtained accuracies (around 70 %) are comparable to those found using the more traditional features and are not sufficient for clinical applications.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> These result support the recent suggestion that cognitive impairment in MS might be caused by cerebral disconnection. Especially cerebral connectivity in theta and delta frequency bands seems to be implicated.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section422-1352458514547846"><title>P697</title><sec id="section423-1352458514547846"><title>Visual and auditory evoked potentials as related to fatigue in multiple sclerosis</title><p>A Pokryszko-Dragan<sup>1</sup>, M Bilinska<sup>1</sup>, E Gruszka<sup>1</sup>, E Kusinska<sup>1</sup>, <underline>R Podemski</underline><sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Department of Neurology, Medical University of Wroclaw, Wroclaw, Poland</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> The origin of fatigue in multiple sclerosis remains unclear.

Duration of MS and degree of disability (Expanded Disability Status Scale - EDSS score) were determined. Fatigue was assessed using the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS/FSS-5).

The results of EP were compared between non-fatigued, moderately and severely fatigued MS patients and controls, and referred to disease-related variables.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> P100 latency was increased and amplitude decreased in moderately and severely fatigued MS subjects. The latency of the V component of BAEP and interlatencies I-III-V were increased in severely fatigued patients. The amplitude of the V component was lowered in fatigued patients.

A standard neurological examination was carried out and the individual degree of disability was established employing the Expanded Disability Status Score (EDSS). At EDSS patients scored from 1.5 to 6.5, mean 4.6 &#x000b1;1.9 SD. Tremor was rated according to the Fahn-Tolosa Marin Rating Scale. rTMS was delivered at 1 Hz frequency, along ten subsequent, separate sessions lasting ten minutes each one (i.e. 600 pulses). All subjects were aware about the aim of the study and fulfilled a formal consent. They were free to interrupt the study at any time. Before the first session, at the fifth day and at the last day of stimulation, kinematics of upper limb movements were recorded. Patients were asked to perform a continuous pointing, moving back and forth, as fast as possible, their right index finger between two black spots depicted on a working table, placed 15 cm apart. Task lasted six minutes divided in six parts, lasting one minute each one, divided by a resting period of 30 sec. Movements were recorded by means of a optoelectronic device (ELITE system) working at the sampling rate of 100 Hz. At the end of the last session a new clinical assessment was carried out.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Movement time, peak of velocity and acceleration and deceleration were analysed. Number of peaks of deceleration during the targeting phase was considered as the key marker of the tremor. Results of kinematics showed an overall improvement of symptoms including a decrease of time of movement execution and time of the deceleration phase as consequence of the reduction of number of peak of deceleration (i.e. tremor).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Reduction of tremor became apparent at the clinical evaluation. Moreover, tremor was effectively influenced by rTMS and patients reported a subjective improvement of their symptoms.

All the patients underwent HUTT and from all of them brain MRI was obtained, while spinal cord MRI was obtained from 76 patients. Blood samples in supine and upright position during HUTT were collected from 74 patients, while from one patient only the sample during supine position was obtained.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Proportion of CIS patients with proven autonomic dysfunction was 65,9%. The most common type of HUTT result was vasovagal syncope (N=22, 25%), followed by POTS (N=16, 18%) and orthostatic hypotension (N=15, 17%), while two or more HUTT pathologies were found in 5 patients (6%). EDSS did not correlate with HUTT findings, while there was a statistically significant correlation between normal clinical findings concerning brainstem (bEDSS=0) and normal HUTT result (p=0,032). MRI findings did not show correlation with HUTT results, but significantly bigger difference between serum noradrenaline levels in supine and upright position were found in patients who had midbrain lesions evident on MRI (p=0,017). Serum levels of adrenaline in the upright position correlated with the type of CIS (p=0,013). When considering latter result highest levels of adrenaline in upright position were measured in patients with spinal cord syndromes and brainstem/cerebellar syndromes. Other adrenaline and noradrenaline values did not correlate with either HUTT results or type of CIS.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Autonomic dysfunction is common in patients with CIS. Since EDSS and bEDSS did not correlate with autonomic dysfunction in patients with CIS, adding new criteria for evaluation of autonomic nervous system, thus leading to better patient follow-up, should be considered.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section432-1352458514547846"><title>P703</title><sec id="section433-1352458514547846"><title>Measurement of visual evoked potentials (VEPs) from awake rats before and after introduction of gliotoxins into the optic chiasm</title><p><underline>BJ Farley</underline><sup>1</sup>, E Morozova<sup>1</sup>, A Worley<sup>1</sup>, J Archbold<sup>1</sup>, T Haynes<sup>1</sup>, M Wittmann<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Biogen Idec, Neurology Research, Cambridge, MA, United States</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Visual evoked potentials (VEPs) are a biomarker used to track visual system function in MS and optic neuritis patients. Understanding how VEP measures relate to underlying pathology would benefit from a pre-clinical animal model, where VEP changes can be tracked over time following a controlled demyelinating lesion, and where histological analyses can be performed at defined time points.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> We aimed to develop an assay to measure VEPs chronically from awake non-behaving rats, before and after the introduction of demyelinating lesions into the optic chiasm.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Animals were chronically implanted with LED lights which independently stimulated the left and right eyes, and with electrodes measuring the electroencephalogram (EEG) signal from the left and right visual cortex. We additionally implanted a guide cannula targeting the optic chiasm. After obtaining baseline awake VEP recordings, we briefly anesthetized the animals and injected a gliotoxin (lysolecithin or ethidium bromide) into the optic chiasm via a needle inserted through the implanted cannula. Additional VEP recordings were then obtained in awake animals in the days and weeks following injections.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> We found that VEPs could be repeatedly recorded on successive days for more than 2 months from individual animals, and that in non-injected animals the latency of the N1 component of the rat VEP was highly stable over this time period. VEP amplitudes were more variable, but such variability was largely accounted for by trial-to-trial changes in the spontaneous EEG state of the animal, and thus could be reduced by sorting trials based on this metric. We found that injections of gliotoxins could be specifically administered into the optic chiasm of implanted animals. Successful targeting of injections into the optic pathway white matter was verified in individual cases by including lidocaine (a reversible sodium channel blocker) in the injection solution and demonstrating a reversible blockade of VEPs during the procedure.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> We demonstrate the possibility of measuring VEPs over days and weeks in individual awake animals following gliotoxin injections into the optic chiasm. This methodology will allow for dynamically tracking VEP measures in response to a controlled demyelinating lesion, and subsequently relating key physiological changes to histological observations.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section434-1352458514547846"><title>P704</title><sec id="section435-1352458514547846"><title>Visual evoked potentials and optic coherence tomography in monitoring involvement of visual pathways in multiple sclerosis</title><p><underline>L Leocani</underline><sup>1</sup>, S Guerrieri<sup>1</sup>, G Di Maggio<sup>1</sup>, R Santangelo<sup>1</sup>, L Ferrari<sup>1</sup>, S Medaglini<sup>1</sup>, M Rodegher<sup>1</sup>, B Colombo<sup>1</sup>, L Moiola<sup>1</sup>, U Del Carro<sup>1</sup>, V Martinelli<sup>1</sup>, G Comi<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>San Raffaele Hospital, Institute of Experimental Neurology (INSPE), Milan, Italy</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> In the assessment the involvement of visual pathways in Multiple Sclerosis-MS, optical coherence tomography-OCT and visual evoked potentials-VEPs are the most common methods</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To investigate their value in longitudinal monitoring of visual pathways involvement.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Eighty people with MS (13 clinically isolated syndrome-CIS, 55 relapsing-remitting-RR, 9 secondary progressive-SP, 3 primary progressive-PP) underwent neurological and neurophysiological evaluation with OCT and VEPs, with repeated clinical assessment after a mean follow-up of one year, when 50 patients also repeated OCT-VEPs.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> VEPs were more sensitive vs OCT in eyes with recent (&#x0003c; 3 months) optic neuritis-ON at baseline (80.0% vs 6.7%, p=0.001), the two sensitivities were similar in chronic ON eyes (78.4 %).

Resolution of inflammation and remyelination contribute to clinical recovery. High b-value q-space imaging (QSI) is a model free diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) technique which reflects change in axonal structure and myelin in animal models of dysmyelination and may be useful for studying repair in MS.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> We aimed to determine whether QSI indices reflect the tissue repair associated with clinical recovery following spinal cord (SC) relapse in MS.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> 20 RRMS patients (14F; mean age 41years; baseline EDSS 4.5 (range 2.5-6.5); mean disease duration 8.3 years) presenting within 4 weeks of upper cervical SC relapse were recruited and assessed with the Expanded Disability Severity Scale (EDSS) at baseline, 1, 3 and 6 months. Patients and 22 healthy controls (17F; mean age 44years) underwent cervical SC imaging at baseline, 1, 3 and 6 months with a cardiac gated QSI protocol. 30 DWI volumes, covering 60mm of SC, centred on C2/3 were acquired in two directions perpendicular (x and y) and in one parallel (z) to the axis of the SC. The diffusion probability density function (dPDF) was computed and voxel-wise maps of the full width at half maximum (FWHM) (which represents the width of the dPDF) and zero displacement probability (P0) (representing the height of the dPDF), were derived for xy and z. A region of interest analysis was performed for the cervical SC at each time point. Patients were classed as &#x0201c;improvers&#x0201d; (EDSS change of &#x02264; -0.5 over 6 months), or &#x0201c;non-improvers&#x0201d; (no improvement on EDSS). Differences in QSI indices (FWHM and P0) at each time point between improvers and healthy controls as well as non-improvers and healthy controls were evaluated using multiple regression analyses, adjusting for age and gender.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Ten (50%) patients clinically improved by 6 month follow up. After correcting for age and gender, perpendicular (xy) diffusivity was significantly higher at baseline in improvers (P&#x0003c; 0.001) and non-improvers (P&#x0003c; 0.001), compared to controls. By 1 month there was no statistical difference in perpendicular diffusivity between improvers and controls, however in non-improvers, perpendicular diffusivity remained significantly elevated at 6 months (P &#x0003c; 0.001).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> We propose that normalisation of perpendicular diffusivity in patients who recover following SC relapse may reflect remyelination and that QSI may therefore be a potentially useful biomarker of repair in MS.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section445-1352458514547846"><title>P709</title><sec id="section446-1352458514547846"><title>NMDA receptor blockade is neuroprotective in experimental autoimmune optic neuritis</title><p><underline>K-W S&#x000fc;hs</underline><sup>1</sup>, R Fairless<sup>2</sup>, SK Williams<sup>2</sup>, K Heine<sup>3</sup>, A Cavali&#x000e9;<sup>4</sup>, R Diem<sup>2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Medical School Hannover, Neurology, Hannover, Germany, <sup>2</sup>University Clinic Heidelberg, Neuro-Oncology, Heidelberg, Germany, <sup>3</sup>University of the Saarland, Neurology, Homburg, Germany, <sup>4</sup>University of the Saarland, Pharmacology and Toxicology, Homburg, Germany</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Optic neuritis can result in persistent visual impairment due to degeneration of optic nerve (ON) axons and apoptosis of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs).

RGCs were retrogradly labelled and quantified. ON histopathology was performed including Luxol-fast blue (LFB), Bielschowsky&#x02019;s silver impregnation, CD3 and ED1. Furthermore calcium imaging of RGCs and oligodendrocytes was performed.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Disease severity was significantly lower in memantine treated groups. By immunohistochemistry demyelination (LFB: vehicle, 84.7%; M20 mg/kg, 41.4%; M60 mg/kg, 4.9% p &#x0003c; 0.0001), axonal damage (Bielschowsky: vehicle 70.4%; M 20, 33.9%; M60, 6.7%, p &#x0003c; 0.0001) and immune cell infiltration was reduced in the treated groups compared to vehicle (CD3-positive cells/mm2: vehicle, 41.9; M20, 21.1; M60, 5.5; p&#x0003c; 0.05).</p><p>In retinas of shamimmunised rats, mean RGC density was 2046 &#x000b1; 120.2 cells/mm2.

In retinas from day 7 after immunization, a timepoint preceding histopathological changes in the ON, higher RGC densities were found in M20 (1415/mm2) and MK-801-treated animals (1364 /mm2) compared to vehicle (1064/mm2; p &#x0003c; 0.002).</p><p>Upon adding 200 &#x000b5;M glutamate to isolated RGCs and oligodendrocytes, intracellular calcium rose rapidly in both cell types. However preincubation with 12 &#x000b5;M memantine significantly reduced the calcium response only in RGCs, confirmed by dose-response experiments to memantine. Conversely, oligodendrocytes were more responsive to blockade of AMPA and kainate receptors.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The results suggest that NMDAr blockade protects RGCs directly independent of an effect on oligodendrocytes and of an anti-inflammatory effect. This indicates an important pathophysiological role of NMDAr mediated glutamate toxicity, highlighting a potentially valid target for therapeutic neuroprotective strategies.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section447-1352458514547846"><title>P710</title><sec id="section448-1352458514547846"><title>NDC-1308, a gain of function estradiol analog for inducing remyelination in multiple sclerosis patients</title><p><underline>SH Nye</underline><sup>1</sup>, S Medicetty<sup>2</sup>, BD Trapp<sup>3</sup>, JG Yarger<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>ENDECE Neural, LLC, Mequon, WI, United States, <sup>2</sup>Renovo Neural Inc, Cleveland, OH, United States, <sup>3</sup>Cleveland Clinic, Neurosciences, Cleveland, OH, United States</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Several estrogens have advanced to clinical trials, yet they impact only the neuroprotective aspects of multiple sclerosis (MS), rather than the elusive remyelination activity needed to repair the damaged myelin sheath. We previously reported that NDC-1308, a proprietary analog of 17-beta-estradiol (E2), activates known intracellular pathways for oligodendrocyte progenitor cell (OPC) differentiation. Unlike E2, NDC-1308 induces mouse OPCs to differentiate into mature oligodendrocytes <italic>in vitro</italic>.

Intended outcomes also include: i) an initial benefit-risk assessment for NDC-1308, ii) determining the dosing parameters for non-clinical IND-enabling studies, and iii) design of the Phase 1 clinical study. As such, NDC-1308 was formulated for injection and assessed for its ability to induce remyelination in the cuprizone mouse model of demyelination.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> NDC-1308 was stably formulated for injection using an SBE-beta-cyclodextrin. Male mice were treated for 12-weeks with cuprizone and rapamycin to cause demyelination of white and gray matter regions of the brain. The demyelinated mice were administered NDC-1308 by intraperitoneal (60 mg/Kg, q.d) or subcutaneous (15-60 mg/Kg, b.i.d.) injections for 3 or 6 weeks. Blood was collected at termination for clinical chemistry analysis, along with reproductive tracts for pathology, and brain regions for assessing the level of NDC-1308 remyelination.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> A 3-week NDC-1308 treatment in cuprizone demyelinated mice resulted in greater than 20% (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c; 0.005) and 16% (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c; 0.05) remyelination of cortical and hippocampal regions, respectively. At 6 weeks of NDC-1308 treatment, remyelination in hippocampal regions increased to 30% (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c; 0.0001). E2 did not induce remyelination. All animals tolerated the chronic NDC-1308 treatments well. Observed animal behavior and clinical chemistries were normal, and there was no evidence of aberrant mammary tissue.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> These results suggest there may be a significant benefit for MS patients by using NDC-1308 to induce remyelination.

Diffuse damage underlies complex degenerative processes, including neuronal and axonal loss, and can be indirectly quantifiable via MRI-derived measures of global brain volume (BV). Focal damage may result from inflammation and manifest as MRI brain lesions and clinical relapses. In Phase 3 clinical trials, fingolimod showed significant reductions in both focal lesions and rate of BV loss in RRMS patients vs. placebo (pbo) and an active comparator.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To investigate if the effects of fingolimod 0.5 mg on BV loss are mediated through its effects on focal damage or if fingolimod also acts independently in reducing diffuse damage.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> In a pooled post-hoc analysis of the phase 3, 24-month (M), double-blind, randomized, FREEDOMS (N=1272) and FREEDOMS II (N=1083) studies, we assessed the percent brain volume change (PBVC, measured by the Structural Image Evaluation using Normalization of Atrophy, SIENA) at M12 and 24, in patients with no evidence of focal disease activity, namely, absence of both new active lesions (Gd+ T1 lesions and/or new/enlarging T2 lesions) and clinical relapses. A regression analysis was performed in the pooled intent-to-treat (ITT) population to quantify whether the extent of treatment effect seen with fingolimod vs. pbo in the overall population (unadjusted model), would be maintained after adjusting for new active lesions and on-study relapses (adjusted model).</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Of the 1383 patients included in this pooled analysis, 808 patients (pbo=142; fingolimod=666) had at M12 and 573 patients (pbo=79; fingolimod=494) at M24 showed no focal activity. Fingolimod significantly reduced PBVC by 52% vs. pbo over 12 M (-0.22 vs -0.46, p=0.002) and by 42% over 24 M (-0.50 vs -0.86, p=0.006). In pooled ITT population, an absolute difference in PBVC of -0.49% (&#x0003c; 0.001) in favor of fingolimod vs pbo over 24 M was observed and was still evident when adjusting for new active lesions and on-study relapse activity (-0.28%, p&#x0003c; 0.001). The regression model suggests that 57% (-0.28%/-0.49%) of the effects of fingolimod on PBVC are independent of its effects on focal damage.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The effect of fingolimod on diffuse damage is partly independent of its treatment effect on focal damage.

SEMA4D signaling through PLXNB1 has been shown to modulate glial cell activation, inhibit differentiation and migration of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs), disrupt CNS endothelial tight junctions, and induce neuronal process collapse. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic neuroinflammatory disease characterized by CNS immune cell infiltration, blood-brain barrier (BBB) breakdown, myelin destruction, and neuronal degeneration. Antibody neutralization of SEMA4D could, therefore, ameliorate multiple sclerosis through multiple mechanisms.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> Blocking SEMA4D could promote differentiation of oligodendrocyte precursors and remyelination. In addition, preventing SEMA4D-mediated breakdown of the blood brain barrier (BBB) may suppress immune cell infiltration into the CNS and reduce inflammation and secondary immune responses to CNS antigens.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> We generated a monoclonal antibody that binds with high affinity to mouse, rat, monkey, and human SEMA4D and blocks the binding of Sema4D to its cognate receptors.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold>
<italic>In vitro</italic>, anti-SEMA4D reverses the inhibitory effects of recombinant SEMA4D on OPC survival and differentiation. <italic>In vivo</italic>, anti-SEMA4D significantly attenuates experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in multiple rodent models by preserving BBB integrity and axonal myelination and can be shown to promote remyelination following chemically-induced demyelination.

ACTH 1-39, a member of the melanocortin family, stimulates production of CS by the adrenals, but melanocortin receptors are also found in the central nervous system (CNS) and on immune cells. ACTH is produced within the CNS and may have direct protective effects on glia and neurons independent of CS. Neurons are the most vulnerable cells in the CNS. They are terminally differentiated, and sensitive to inflammatory and excitotoxic insults. We previously found that ACTH 1-39 protected oligodendroglia and their progenitors from a panel of excitotoxic and inflammation-related agents (Benjamins et al., 2013). For therapeutic protection of gray matter in MS, it is important to extend these studies to the effects of ACTH on neurons.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To investigate protective effects of ACTH 1-39 on neurons <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Cultures highly enriched in neurons were isolated from 2-3 day old rat brain (Eide and McMurray, 2005), with the addition of 1 &#x000b5;g/ml nerve growth factor (NGF) (Lisak et al., 2011). Neurons, immunostained for NeuN or neurofilament- H (NF-H), represented 85-90% of the cells, with less than 10% astrocytes and 4% microglia, as determined by double label immunofluorescence. Cultures were treated for 1 day with selected toxic agents with or without ACTH. Neuronal death was assessed by trypan blue uptake; apoptosis was measured by Apoptag staining.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> ACTH (200 nM) protected neurons from death induced by 20 nM staurosporine, a classic inducer of apoptosis, by a mechanism including generation of reactive oxygen species. Neuronal death was 12% in untreated control cultures; by 24 hours, staurosporine caused 80% neuronal death, which was reduced to 55% by ACTH (p&#x0003c; 0.01). Apoptag staining also demonstrated protection by ACTH from staurosporine. Immunostaining for NF-H showed that ACTH preserved neuronal processes in the presence of staurosporine.

The optic nerve can serve as a model of the central nervous system, allowing for evaluation of inflammation and degeneration using optical coherence tomography (OCT) to measure retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness and other afferent pathway markers. Vitamin D insufficiency is a risk factor for multiple sclerosis while vitamin D ameliorates inflammation. Assessment of vitamin D status in optic neuritis may support a neuroprotective role as well.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> We hypothesize that vitamin D sufficiency (25(OH)D &#x0003e; 80 nmol/L) is associated with better OCT outcomes and axonal preservation/recovery after optic neuritis. Outcomes include RNFL thickness, ganglion cell layer (GCL) thickness and inter-eye difference (IED) in both at 6 months and baseline between vitamin D sufficient and insufficient groups.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> In this prospective cohort study, a total target of 50 patients with acute optic neuritis undergo OCT to assess RNFL GCL, macular volume (MV) and serum 25(OH)D testing at baseline and month 6.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Fifty-four patients were screened and 50 enrolled, although that number dropped to 49 with a change in diagnosis. Of the 49 patients studied, 68% were vitamin D insufficient at baseline, which was associated with greater baseline edema in RNFL (131 vs. 106 &#x000b5;m, p=0.14) and MV (10.2 vs. 9.8 mm<sup>3</sup>, p=0.036). At month 6, while RNFL edema persisted and the higher RNFL IED in vitamin D insufficient patients did not reach statistical significance (12 vs. 8 &#x000b5;m), the higher GCL IED in insufficient versus sufficient patients (14 vs. 6 &#x000b5;m, p=0.067) was a more robust finding. This is presumably related to the absence of edema in the GCL. Regardless of baseline RNFL or vitamin D status, men had significantly lower 6-month RNFL (70 vs. 81 &#x000b5;m, p=0.018), lower 6-month GCL (60 vs 67 &#x000b5;m, p=0.040) and greater IED in both the RNFL and GCL (21 vs. 7 &#x000b5;m, p=0.003 and 21 vs. 8 &#x000b5;m, p=0.003 respectively) versus women.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Not surprisingly, vitamin D insufficiency at optic neuritis onset is associated with greater baseline edema. At 6 months, there is also evidence that vitamin D insufficiency is associated with possible neuronal/axonal loss in the optic nerve. Furthermore, we have shown that male gender is an independent risk factor for poorer OCT outcomes at 6 months. Thus, despite residual edema at 6 months, OCT data suggests vitamin D and female gender may confer neuroprotection and/or improved recovery of the optic nerve after optic neuritis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section461-1352458514547846"><title>P717</title><sec id="section462-1352458514547846"><title>Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) influences recovery after white matter damage by acting on astrocytes and oligodendrocyte progenitors</title><p>C Leonetti<sup>1</sup>, J Bronsard<sup>1</sup>, D Vivien<sup>1</sup>, F Docagne<sup>1</sup>, <underline>R Macrez</underline><sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Inserm U 919, University of Caen, Caen, France</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic disease of the central nervous system (CNS) characterized by successive cycles of demyelination and remyelinisation.

GPR17 is expressed early in OPCs, is needed to start differentiation but is turned down before cells reach functional maturation. Of note, GPR17 is upregulated <italic>in vivo</italic> under demyelinating conditions like focal cerebral ischemia or lysolecithin-induced demyelination, suggesting that its alterations may contribute to myelin dysfunction.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> Here, we aimed at (i) analysing GPR17 expression in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) MS rodent model, and (ii) assessing the functional consequences of persistent GPR17 up-regulation in cultured OPCs.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> EAE was induced on C57BL/6 female mice and immunohistochemical analysis performed 21 days after immunization. Cultured OPCs were transfected with a fluorescent reporter plasmid in which GPR17 coding sequence had been fused with Green Fluorescence Protein (GPR17-GFP). As a control, the same GFP empty vector was used. Cells taking up these plasmids become green and their final destiny can be traced by fluorescence microscopy.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> In EAE spinal cord, increased numbers of GPR17<sup>+</sup> OPCs accumulated around areas of tissue infiltration by blood-derived cells.

We also propose that pharmacological agents reverting GPR17 upregulation may induce OPCs to overcome this maturation block and to resume myelination. In this respect, we are currently developing new diverse chemical entities acting as selective GPR17 ligands.

Since demyelinated axons are vulnerable to atrophy, remyelination might protect against progressive axonal damage and thus long-term disability in MS patients. Still, therapeutic approaches to increase myelin repair are not available.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> We analyzed the effects of cytidine-5&#x02019;-diphospho (CDP)-choline on CNS remyelination in mice after cuprizone induced demyelination.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> To induce demyelination C57BL/6 male mice were fed with 0.2% cuprizone for up to 5 weeks. Animals received CDP-choline, beginning on the day of cuprizone feeding, for the subsequent days until the animals were killed. Mice were sacrificed at different time points to analyze the effects of CDP-choline on de- and remyelination (for demyelination weeks 4, 4.5 and 5; for remyelination weeks 5.5 and 6).

During remyelination CDP-choline effectively increased myelin repair. Mice treated with CDP-choline presented high densities of new myelin proteins throughout the complete corpus callosum and increased numbers of myelinated axons as shown by electronmicroscopy. The increased remyelination arose from an increase in the numbers of proliferating oligodendrocyte precursor cells and oligodendrocytes. <italic>In vitro</italic> studies suggest that this process is regulated by protein kinase C.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> We have identified CDP-choline as a new substance to enhance CNS remyelination.

Recent animal studies have shown that the most effective way to protect axons is restoration of myelin. Although there are plenty of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) within MS lesions, the efficiency of spontaneous generation of OL declines dramatically with every episode of demyelination. Therapeutic intervention to stimulate differentiation of OL and remyelination has the potential to reverse function decline in MS patients.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To identify new small molecule compounds that stimulate differentiation of OL, using a highly pure population of mouse primary OPCs and high-content screening system in a medium throughput 96-well plate format.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> OPCs were derived from E14.5 mouse embryos expressing <italic>PLP</italic>-EGFP. Small molecules were used at 10 &#x000b5;M and media was changed once at 48 hrs. Cells were fixed and stained with nuclear dye Hoechst.

Using this system, we identified 45 hits with EC50 lower than 1uM after screening a library containing 20,000 small molecules. The effect of these hits was confirmed in secondary screening using oligodendrocyte markers O4 and MBP. These hits belong to at least six distinct chemical structural groups, with a EC50 of ~0.02uM for the lead compound. Western blotting analysis further confirmed that protein expression levels of oligodendrocyte differentiation markers, including PLP, CNPase, and MBP, were stimulated as early as 24hr at levels similar to or higher than our positive control T3. These compounds do not contain obvious toxicophores and have low toxicity, as revealed by MTT assay. The molecular pathways stimulated by these compounds are being investigated.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Using our optimized high-content screening system, we have identified several small molecule leads that can induce differentiation of oligodendrocytes with high efficacy and low toxicity.

Recombination was induced with 4-HT at week 2. Mice were sacrificed weekly, beginning 2 weeks after recombination. The fate of the OPCs was determined imunohistochemically via colocalization of eYFP with multiple cellular makers including PDGF&#x003b1;R (OPCs), CC1 (oligodendrocytes), GFAP (astrocytes), and NeuN (neurons).</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> At 4 weeks the density of YFP<sup>+</sup> PDGF&#x003b1;R<sup>+</sup> cells (OPCs) was 3 fold higher in the corpus callosum of cuprizone treated animals as opposed to controls, while the density of YFP<sup>+</sup>CC1<sup>+</sup> cells (mature oligodendrocytes) was low in both groups. This was followed by a 6 fold increase in the density of YFP<sup>+</sup>CC1<sup>+</sup> cells at the 6 week time point and a return of YFP<sup>+</sup> PDGF&#x003b1;R<sup>+</sup> cell density to control levels. Interestingly, the kinetics of OPC differentiation and maturation in gray matter areas appeared to be quite different with much less expression of recombined cells at these time points.

Differentiation of oligodendroglial precursor cells (OPCs) to myelinating oligodendrocytes is often impaired, resulting in limited remyelination, especially in chronic MS lesions. Multiple pathways, among them the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling cascade has been implicated to contribute to remyelination failure in MS. In earlier studies we could show that a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) is able to promote significantly the differentiation of murine oligodendrocytes.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> Aim of our study was 1. to determine whether the NSAID promotes also the differentiation of human oligodendrocytes 2. to study the remyelination promoting capacity of the NSAID and 3. to dissect the mechanisms by which the NSAID promotes oligodendroglial differentiation.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Human and murine oligodendroglial cell culture, qRT-PCR, reporter assays, Western blots, cuprizone model, immunohistochemistry, EM</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> We observed a significantly increased number of mature oligodendrocytes after addition of the compound to human oligodendroglial cell cultures. In the cuprizone model daily injections of the NSAID during the remyelinating phase resulted in higher numbers of mature oligodendrocytes, increased expression levels of myelin associated genes and accelerated remyelination using immunohistochemistry, qRT-PCR and electron microscopic studies. Exposure of murine oligodendrocytes to the compound increased phosphorylation of beta-catenin at serines 33, 35 und 37 as shown in Western blots. The positive effect of the NSAID on oligodendroglial differentiation was abrogated using inhibitors of glycogen synthetase 3 beta (GSK3b) that is part of the beta-catenin degradation complex. Transfection of a murine oligodendroglial cell line with a reporter assay confirmed the downregulation of the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway after addition of the NSAID. Furthermore, in genetically modified oligodendrocytes in which beta-catenin cannot be phosphorylated and degraded, no effect of the NSAID on differentiation was observed.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The NSAID promotes differentiation of murine and human oligodendrocytes <italic>in vitro</italic> and enhances remyelination; furthermore our results suggest that these effects are at least partly mediated by activation of GSK3beta and increased degradation of beta-catenin.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section479-1352458514547846"><title>P726</title><sec id="section480-1352458514547846"><title>The effects of GSK239512 on lesion remyelination in a relapsing remitting MS population: design of a phase 2a imaging study</title><p><underline>C Schwartzbach</underline><sup>1</sup>, R Grove<sup>2</sup>, P Thompson<sup>3</sup>, O Graff<sup>1</sup>, MA Peykamian<sup>1</sup>, K Harding<sup>1</sup>, J Hilpert<sup>4</sup>, R Brown<sup>5</sup>, D Arnold<sup>5</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>GlaxoSmithKline, Research Triangle Park, NC, United States, <sup>2</sup>GlaxoSmithKline, Stockley Park, United Kingdom, <sup>3</sup>GlaxoSmithKline, Stevenage, United Kingdom, <sup>4</sup>GlaxoSmithKline, Shanghai, China, <sup>5</sup>NeuroRx Research, Montreal, QC, Canada</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> GSK239512 is a potent, selective, orally bioavailable and brain penetrant histamine 3 receptor (H3R) antagonist/inverse agonist.

The underlying mechanisms remain elusive, but there is accumulating evidence that oxidative stress may play a key role. Dimethylfumarate (DMF) is a novel oral therapeutic, which reduces disease activity and progression in patients with relapsing-remitting MS. These effects are presumed to originate from a combination of immunomodulatory and neuroprotective effects.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> In this work, we determined time- and concentration-dependant effects of DMF on viability in a model of endogenous neuronal oxidative stress.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> By measuring the intracellular gluthathion content as well as its recycling, the nuclear translocation of transcription factors and the expression of cyto-protective genes we were able to show the protective effect of dimethylfumarate.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Previous work from our laboratory demonstrated that DMF protects from oxidative stress by enhancing glutathione (GSH) synthesis and recycling. Recycling is mediated by glutathione reductase (GSR), a homodimeric flavoprotein that catalyzes GSSG reduction to GSH by using NADPH as a reducing cofactor. Protection was still present after inhibition of GSH synthesis in medium lacking cystine, the limiting amino acid of the tripeptide GSH. Protective concentrations of DMF induced GSR at the protein level. Knock down of GSR by siRNA abolished the protective effect of DMF in conditions with inhibited glutathione synthesis.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> We conclude that DMF enhances glutathione recycling by increased expression and function of glutathione reductase.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section483-1352458514547846"><title>P728</title><sec id="section484-1352458514547846"><title>A high throughput flow cytometry based approach to assess the differentiation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells into mature oligodendrocytes</title><p><underline>C Hollins</underline><sup>1</sup>, H Sandig<sup>1</sup>, C Glover<sup>1</sup>, C Jones<sup>1</sup>, M Sleeman<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>MedImmune, RIA, Cambridge, United Kingdom</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Oligodendrocytes are specialised cells in the brain responsible for myelinating neurons. In multiple sclerosis (MS), myelin becomes damaged, and over time, repair of demyelinated lesions fails. Oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) are present in MS brain, but appear trapped in an immature form, unable to differentiate and remyelinate lesions. Thus, promoting the differentiation of OPC&#x02019;s into mature, myelinating oligodendrocytes is an attractive regenerative strategy with potential therapeutic efficacy. The maturation of OPCs is immunocytochemically well characterised and is typically quantified by manual counting and applying a scoring system based on the percentage of cells that have a mature phenotype compared to total cells. Such a method is labour intensive and time consuming.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> The aim of our work was to apply flow cytometry to develop a sensitive, high throughput assay to detect subtle changes in OPC differentiation by investigating multiple cellular markers simultaneously.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Flow cytometry was used to investigate OPC differentiation in cells obtained from P2 Wistar rat brains. Mixed glial cell preparations were grown for 10 days, shaken at 200rpm to obtain OPCs and pre-plated to remove microglia before seeding. Cells were treated with fibroblast growth factor (FGF)/platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) for 3 days and then maintained in differentiation conditions for a further 3 days. Expression of GLAST and CD11b were used to exclude astrocytes and microglia respectively and oligodendrocyte markers A2B5, O4 and O1 were used to assess and quantify differentiation.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Astrocytes and microglia represented approximately 10-15% of total cells. OPCs maintained in FGF/PDGF remained in an immature state with no O1 expression. O1 expression was induced by growth factor withdrawal and by triiodothyronine (T3). Other, previously described, promoters of differentiation such as 9-cis retinoic acid also induced O1 expression. Simultaneous analysis of A2B5 and O4 showed de-differentiation of the OPCs 1 day post FGF/PDGF treatment compared with OPCs stained directly post shake off.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Flow cytometry is a robust, reproducible, data rich and a novel platform to investigate and quantify OPC maturation on a high throughput scale.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section485-1352458514547846"><title>P729</title><sec id="section486-1352458514547846"><title>Serial individual lesion MTR follow-up for studies of potentially remyelinating therapies in MS</title><p><underline>S Mallik</underline><sup>1</sup>, DR Altmann<sup>1,2</sup>, DJ Tozer<sup>1</sup>, JWL Brown<sup>3</sup>, P Connick<sup>4</sup>, M Kolappan<sup>1</sup>, S Chandran<sup>5</sup>, D Miller<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>UCL Institute of Neurology, NMR Research Unit, Queen Square MS Centre, London, United Kingdom, <sup>2</sup>London School of Hygeine and Tropical Medicine, Medical Statistics Department, London, United Kingdom, <sup>3</sup>University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom, <sup>4</sup>University of Cambridge, Department of Clinical Neurosciences, Cambridge, United Kingdom, <sup>5</sup>University of Edinburgh, Centre of Clinical Brain Science, Edinburgh, United Kingdom</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Magnetisation Transfer Ratio (MTR) decreases with demyelination, and increases with remyelination. A trial of autosomal mesenchymal stem cells in secondary progressive MS analysed mean MTR of all lesions serially to calculate rate of change of MTR before and after intervention and showed a non-significant trend for MTR increase during the post-treatment phase. This technique, however, is not sensitive to changes within individual lesions.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To develop a lesion analysis pathway allowing individual lesion MTR to be measured serially, investigating lesion myelination before and after a treatment intervention.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> 10 patients had 3 MRI scans prior to infusion (6, 3, 0 months before), and 2 scans post infusion (3, 6 months after). Lesions were marked on T2<sub>w</sub> and T1<sub>w</sub> scans obtained at baseline, and follow-up scans were registered to the baseline. Baseline lesion masks were registered to the baseline scan, then divided into individual lesion masks. Registrations were visually checked by two assessors. Individual lesion masks were applied to the MTR maps, to calculate the MTR of each T2<sub>w</sub> and T1<sub>w</sub> lesion at each time-point. A piecewise linear mixed model was used to model the MTR gradients of individual lesions before and after infusion; a similar model was used in the previous analysis of average lesion MTR level gradients.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> All results are in percent units per month. For mean T2<sub>w</sub> lesion MTR, rate of MTR change was -0.1738 before infusion, and +0.3859 after infusion. The difference in rate of change after infusion was +0.5597 (p=0.186, 95% CI -0.2703, +1.3896). For individual lesion MTR, rate of change of T2w lesions was -0.052 before infusion, and +0.045 after infusion. The difference in rate of change after infusion was +0.097 (p&#x0003c; 0.001, 95% CI +0.071, +0.124).

AON slows nerve conduction velocity (NCV) and compromises visual function. LINGO-1 is a CNS-specific cell surface glycoprotein that may suppress remyelination and axonal regeneration in CNS diseases. In rodent models of optic nerve injury, LINGO-1 blockade leads to axonal protection and improved retinal ganglion cell survival. An anti-LINGO-1 monoclonal antibody, BIIB033, blocks LINGO-1 and was well tolerated in Phase I studies in healthy volunteers and MS subjects.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To evaluate efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of BIIB033 in a Phase II study of subjects with AON (RENEW) based on positive findings from preclinical and Phase I studies.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> RENEW is being conducted in 11 countries in subjects with a first, unilateral episode of AON.

The primary efficacy endpoint is change in optic NCV at Week 24 for the affected eye from the baseline value for the unaffected eye, using full-field visual evoked potentials. Secondary endpoints include change in thickness of the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) and retinal ganglion cell layer/inner plexiform layer (RGCL/IPL), using spectral domain optical coherence tomography and change in low-contrast letter acuity (LCLA) and high-contrast visual acuity (HCVA) using Sloan charts.

Furthermore, a survival analysis with five-year follow-up was performed among the 4,571 MS patients not on disability pension in 2005 with psychiatric diagnoses and medication as risk factors, and disability pension as the outcome.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Among MS patients, 35% had been prescribed psychiatric medication compared to 10% of non-MS individuals, adjusted OR 3.72 (95% CI 3.57 to 3.88). Ten percent of MS patients had received a psychiatric diagnosis, compared to 5.7% of non-MS individuals, OR 1.82 (95% CI 1.71 to 1.94). Serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs, 17%), were the most commonly prescribed drugs (17%) among MS patients, while depression (4.8%) was the most common psychiatric diagnosis. In the survival analysis, MS patients with any psychiatric diagnosis had a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.83 (95% CI 1.53 to 2.18) for disability pension compared to other MS patients. MS patients with any psychiatric drug prescription had a HR for disability pension of 2.09 (95% CI 1.84 to 2.33).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Psychiatric diagnoses and medication are common among MS patients and adversely affect risk for disability pension. This highlights the importance of correct diagnosis and management of psychiatric comorbidity, in a clinical as well as in a societal perspective.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section500-1352458514547846"><title>P736</title><sec id="section501-1352458514547846"><title>Depression and multiple sclerosis in the CombiRx study</title><p><underline>L Stone</underline><sup>1</sup>, SS Cofield<sup>2</sup>, T Gustafson<sup>3</sup>, GR Cutter<sup>2</sup>, JS Wolinsky<sup>4</sup>, FD Lublin<sup>3</sup>, The CombiRx Investigators</p><p><sup>1</sup>Mellen Center for MS Treatment and Research, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, United States, <sup>2</sup>UAB School of Public Health, Biostatistics, Birmingham, AL, United States, <sup>3</sup>Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, Corinne Goldsmith Dickinson Center for MS, New York, NY, United States, <sup>4</sup>University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, Department of Neurology, Houston, TX, United States</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Depression is common in persons with multiple sclerosis (MS). Severity can change overtime and be related to worsening outcomes. Understanding these issues is important for improving the quality of life of MS patients.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To assess prevalence and severity of depression in relapsing remitting MS and the association with the EDSS, self-report Mental Health Inventory (MHI) and Depression Subscale (MHD) - part of the MSQLI.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> The CombiRx trial was a multi-center, double-blind, three-arm trial that randomized 1008 participants to combination therapy [interferon (IFN) and glatiramer acetate (GA)] versus each agent alone plus placebo. The core study was 3 years with up to 7 years of follow up in the extension phase. History of depression (HD) was assessed at baseline using medical history or report of feeling depressed within 4 weeks prior to enrollment. The EDSS was measured quarterly, the MSQLI annually. Study Exclusion criteria included history of suicidal ideation or an episode of severe depression within 12 weeks prior to randomization.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> HD was reported by 720 (71.4%) of participants, with no differences by age, race, gender, diagnosis criteria, duration of disease, or treatment arm. HD was more prevalent in single persons (p=0.005), those with more relapses in the prior 12 months (p=0.034) and higher among those with an EDSS &#x0003e; 2 (p=0.003). When adjusted for BL EDSS score, follow up time, and treatment, HD saw more EDSS worsening over time (0.3 vs 0.05, p=0.008), with no difference in the likelihood of relapses. There was no difference in core study completion by HD at baseline (p=0.09) but when adjusting for treatment, those reporting more severe depression by both the MHI (p=0.003) and MDH (p=0.005) at baseline were more likely to terminate prior to 3 years.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Those with a history of depression prior to enrollment saw increase worsening in both clinical and patient reported outcomes.

Patients may experience bowel symptoms or abdominal distress when they become anxious. Bowel dysfunction can negatively affect patients&#x02019; quality of life (QoL). Additionally, symptoms may be under-reported to their healthcare providers due to embarrassment. A determinant of QoL is illness intrusiveness, in which the disease and related treatments interfere in aspects of patients&#x02019; lives, such as intimacy, instrumental activities of daily living, and relationships. Previously, we showed a trend with depression (<italic>p</italic> = .0514), as measured by the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), moderating the relationship between bowel dysfunction and illness intrusiveness.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To examine the relationship between anxiety and bowel dysfunction, and how that relationship contributes to perceived illness intrusiveness.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Participants (<italic>N</italic> = 208) were MS patients at an outpatient clinic at Holy Name Medical Center in Teaneck, NJ who signed research consent forms. Bowel dysfunction was measured by the Incapacity Status Scale (ISS). Moderation analyses were run with bowel dysfunction as the predictor, anxiety as measured by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) as the moderator, and Illness Intrusiveness Rating Scale (IIRS) Total Score as the outcome measure.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Bowel dysfunction ranged from severe (4) to none (0), with the majority having mild to none.

Although generalised anxiety disorder is known to be common in multiple sclerosis (MS), chronic worry has not been extensively studied in this population. In other conditions, chronic worry has been associated with features which are also common in MS such as chronic pain, poor sleep, and fatigue.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> We aimed to validate the Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ) in an MS population by testing it for fit against the Rasch model.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> The scale was completed by 254 MS patients (68.6% female, mean age 50.4y, sd 12.1y). The Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale and several other measures were included as part of the Trajectories of Outcomes in Neurological Conditions (TONiC) study investigating quality of life in chronic neurological disease. Respondents had a wide range of disabilities (37.8% EDSS 0-4, 47.6% EDSS 4.5-6.5, 14.2% EDSS&#x0003e;7.0), disease durations (mean 13.2y, sd 9.6y) and disease subtypes (48.0% relapsing-remitting MS; 25.4% secondary progressive MS; 15.5% rapidly evolving MS and 11.1% primary progressive MS). Data were analysed in an iterative procedure using RUMM 2030 software.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The original scale showed excellent reliability (&#x003b1;=0.92) but did not fit the Rasch model (p&#x0003c; 0.000) due to significant misfit of 7 of the 16 items. The scale breached the assumptions of the model due to evidence of widespread local dependency and multidimensionality (t-test=22.5%). Combining dependent items into testlets eliminated local dependency and multidimensionality (t-test lower confidence interval=0.045) but did not improve fit to the model (p&#x0003c; 0.000) due to significant under discrimination of the testlet incorporating items 1, 3, 8 and 11. Removing these 4 items along with item 10 provided a reliable solution which met the assumptions and fitted the Rasch model (&#x003b1;=0.94 p=0.144, t-test=1.98%). The modified version of the scale showed only moderate correlation with the HADS-anxiety scale (Pearson Correlation=0.585).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The modified PSWQ is a reliable, valid and unidimensional measure of worry in MS and can be used to study this construct across a broad range of disabilities in all disease subtypes.

In addition, the availability of new disease-modifying drugs may have changed the perception of disease by caregivers and patients, and thus it is important to investigate their satisfaction with current treatments.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> The main objective of the study is to evaluate the burden of distress in caregivers and patients suffering from RRMS, and to describe their satisfaction with their current treatment.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> The MS-Feeling is a multicenter, observational, cross-sectional study which will include approximately 200 patients (and their informal caregivers) aged&#x02265;18 years with RRMS, treated with a disease-modifying drug for at least 1 year. The primary endpoint will be the caregiver burden, assessed by the Zarit Caregiver Burden Interview. Secondary endpoints will include: family stress perceived by caregivers and patients (Family adaptation, partnership, growth, affection, resolve -AGPAR- Questionnaire); degree of social support perceived by caregivers (Duke-University of North Carolina Functional Social Support Questionnaire); depressive symptoms in caregivers and patients (Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, short form); and satisfaction of caregivers (Caregiver Satisfaction with Treatment of Multiple Sclerosis Questionnaire) and patients (Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication) with treatment.

Six months after diagnosis parents were asked to complete the PedsQL multidimensional fatigue scale (lower scores represent worse fatigue; 0-100) and the Profile of Neuropsychiatric Symptoms (PONS), a scale measuring frequency and impact of neuropsychiatric symptoms (33 items). Results were analysed (SPSS version 22) using statistical tests appropriate to distribution of data.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Data from 33 patients (19 male, median age 8; range 1-16) with ADEM (n=11); ON (n=7); TM (n=8); NMO (n=2); MS (n=5) was ascertained. All data given as median (range) and/or [mean (SD)]. Patients were followed up for 3.9 years (1.3-4.3). Six months after disease onset, multidimensional fatigue scores were general 66 (17-100) [68 (26)], sleep 83 (33-100) [75 (20)], cognitive 70 (4-100) [66 (29)] and total fatigue score 73 (24-100) [70 (23)]. Scores for general fatigue and sleep fatigue were lower in the MS/NMO/TM group compared to the ADEM/ON group (p&#x0003c; 0.05). Median PONS scores for all patients revealed the most frequently reported symptoms as: sleep problems, inattention, eating problems, worries, low mood, oppositionality, explosive rage and fears; with trends (p=0.059) towards higher scores in the MS/TM/NMO group 62 (2-186) compared to the ADEM/ON group 35(9-127). The multivariate linear regression model revealed the following as strong predictors for fatigue: memory problems; low mood; sleep problems; hyperactivity; and impulsivity (r square 0.82).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> At 6 months after onset of ADS there is significant impact of fatigue which is greater for patients with MS/NMO/TM compared to patients with ADEM/ON.

We used Cox proportional hazards (PH) to determine risk of MS and time to MS diagnosis as a function of serum 25(OH)D levels at ADS onset and in the following year, accounting for potential confounders such as age, body mass index (BMI), sex, season, and HLA-DRB1*15 status. We used multivariable regression models to evaluate factors influencing 25(OH)D levels at ADS onset.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Of 225 eligible participants, 47 children (20.9%) were diagnosed with MS a median of 105 days (IQR 94-222 days) from ADS onset. Higher 25(OH)D levels at ADS onset were associated with a lower risk of MS (adjusted HR/10 nmol/L increase: 0.86; 95% CI: 0.77-0.97), but 25(OH)D levels in serial samples post-ADS were not (HR/10 nmol/L increase: 1.00; 95% CI: 0.89-1.12). Among children with MS, higher 25(OH)D levels at enrollment were associated with a lower hazard of a second clinical attack (adjusted HR per 10 nmol/L increase: 0.82; 95% CI: 0.67-0.99); that is, a longer time to a second attack. In multivariable analyses, higher 25(OH)D levels at ADS onset were associated with summer season, younger age at ADS onset, and intake of supplements containing vitamin D.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Higher serum 25(OH)D at pediatric ADS onset but not during the year thereafter is associated with a lower likelihood of MS outcome and longer time to second attack, suggesting that vitamin D contributes to the inciting biology of MS. Vitamin D supplement intake is a modifiable factor associated with higher 25(OH)D levels, indicating that vitamin D supplementation represents a strategy to improve vitamin D status and possibly reduce risk of MS.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section525-1352458514547846"><title>P748</title><sec id="section526-1352458514547846"><title>Puberty onset and pediatric multiple sclerosis course</title><p><underline>S Lulu</underline><sup>1</sup>, J Graves<sup>1</sup>, E Waubant<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>University of California, Neurology, San Francisco, CA, United States</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Pregnancy is a major disease modifier for MS course. Another dramatic hormonal change is puberty. While pre-pubertal MS onset is rare, it affects males and females equally in contrast with the higher ratio of females in post-pubertal patients. How puberty influences clinical features and disease course in pediatric MS patients is unknown.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To determine association of puberty with age of onset of pediatric MS and differences in clinical features of pre- versus post-pubertal MS in girls.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> This is a longitudinal retrospective study using prospectively collected data from the University of California San Francisco Regional Pediatric MS Center database that includes 300 patients of which 100 are females with MS. Pediatric MS was defined as disease onset before the age of 18. As puberty onset is poorly defined, we used the year of menarches in female patients as a reliable proxy for puberty. Post-pubertal females with missing menarche data were not included. Poisson regression models were used for relapse analysis. Analyses were adjusted for ethnicity and body mass index (bmi).</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Preliminary results are available from girls of which 20 had pre-pubertal and 37 had post-pubertal disease onset. Of those with pre-pubertal disease onset, 5 have not yet reached menarche. Forty -six percent were Hispanic, and 44% non-white. Median age at disease onset was 14.1 years (IQ range 4.3 - 17.9). Duration of follow-up since disease onset was 4.7 &#x000b1; 2.9 years (mean &#x000b1; SD). For those who reached menarche, median disease onset was 2.2 years (IQ range -4.1 - 5.8) after menarches. Females with pre-pubertal disease onset had lower incidence of relapses (incidence rate ratio 0.14, 95% CI 0.1- 0.3, p&#x0003c; 0.001) compared to those with post-pubertal disease onset adjusting for ethnicity and bmi. Further analyses are in process to determine associations of pubertal status and anatomic localization and disease progression.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Pubertal status may influence MS course at least in female patients. Understanding how puberty influences MS clinical features may offer new insights in important factors regulating disease processes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section527-1352458514547846"><title>P749</title><sec id="section528-1352458514547846"><title>Recurrent optic neuritis in children</title><p><underline>L Benson</underline><sup>1</sup>, G Heidary<sup>1</sup>, J Graves<sup>2</sup>, T Chitnis<sup>3</sup>, Y Harris<sup>4</sup>, J Ness<sup>4</sup>, J Rose<sup>5</sup>, A Belman<sup>6</sup>, M Rodriguez<sup>7</sup>, J-M Tillema<sup>7</sup>, E Waubant<sup>2</sup>, B Weinstock-Guttman<sup>8</sup>, M Gorman<sup>9</sup>, US Network of Pediatric Multiple Sclerosis Centers</p><p><sup>1</sup>Children&#x02019;s Hospital Boston, Boston, MA, United States, <sup>2</sup>University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, United States, <sup>3</sup>Mass General Hospital for Children, Boston, MA, United States, <sup>4</sup>University of Alabama, Birmingham, AL, United States, <sup>5</sup>University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, United States, <sup>6</sup>Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY, United States, <sup>7</sup>Mayo Medical Center, Rochester, MN, United States, <sup>8</sup>Buffalo University, Buffalo, NY, United States, <sup>9</sup>Boston Children&#x02019;s Hospital, Boston, MA, United States</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Recurrent optic neuritis (ON) occurs in children without MS or NMO, yet is underreported in the literature.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> Our goal was to investigate the clinical characteristics of this patient subgroup.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data from May 2011 to April 2014 on all patients in the US Network of Pediatric MS Centers database presenting with their first demyelinating attack before their 18<sup>th</sup> birthday who had more than one attack of ON but did not meet criteria for MS or NMO.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> 20 patients (8 girls, 12 boys) met inclusion criteria and were followed for a mean duration of 7 months. Mean age at first attack was 9.2 years (range 4.3-15.3). A total of 52 attacks of ON occurred in the cohort. The mean number of episodes of ON was 2.6 (range 2-4) and the median duration between attacks was 9 months (range 1-172 months). 9 patients had only idiopathic attacks of ON without other neurologic symptoms whereas 8 presented with ADEM followed by recurrent ON (ADEM-ON). 2 patients did not fit well in either group. 14 (27%) of attacks were preceded by prodromal symptoms including GI infection, respiratory illness and fever. Although, 31 (60%) of attacks were unilateral, over the follow-up period, 15 (75%) had an attack of bilateral ON. The median lowest recorded visual acuity from the most affected eye was between 20/70 and 20/200. At last follow-up, 14 (70%) recovered 20/20 vision and optic disc pallor was present in 11 (55%) of patients. 14 (70%) had lesions on brain MRI (5 idiopathic recurrent ON, 8 ADEM-ON) and 4 (20%) within the spinal cord (1 recurrent ON, 2 ADEM-ON). Oligoclonal bands were present in 1 idiopathic recurrent ON patient and 1 ADEM-ON patient. IgG index was elevated in one patient. No patient was positive for NMO IgG. 8 patients had evidence of infection with EBV (prior or current infection). Treatments used in at least 2 patients included methylprednisolone, prednisone, and InterferonB-1a. 4 patients on treatment and 10 patients off treatment had been attack free for over 6 months at most recent follow up.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Of children with recurrent ON who do not meet diagnostic criteria for MS or NMO, most have a disease course consistent with idiopathic recurrent ON (45%) or ADEM-ON (40%). Some children with idiopathic recurrent ON may have Chronic Relapsing Inflammatory Optic Neuropathy (CRION), as described in adults. Increased awareness of this disease in children is necessary to facilitate better recognition, understanding and treatment of the disease.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section529-1352458514547846"><title>P750</title><sec id="section530-1352458514547846"><title>Behavioral ratings in pediatric multiple sclerosis (MS)</title><p><underline>MW Porter</underline><sup>1,2</sup>, LE Charvet<sup>1,2</sup>, D Serafin<sup>3</sup>, N Difiore<sup>1,2</sup>, AL Belman<sup>1,2</sup>, LB Krupp<sup>1,2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Stony Brook University, Department of Neurology, Stony Brook, NY, United States, <sup>2</sup>Lourie Center for Pediatric MS, Stony Brook, NY, United States, <sup>3</sup>Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA, United States</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> The behavioral correlates of pediatric MS remain unclear.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To measure behavioral areas most frequently of clinical concern in pediatric MS.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> A total of 129 outpatients consecutively evaluated at the Lourie Center for Pediatric MS were administered the Behavioral Assessment System for Children, second edition (BASC-2), self- and parent-report forms as part of their routine clinical visit which included a neuropsychological evaluation.

About 29.3% of patients experienced clinical relapse (17.1% motor impairment) and 36.6% of patients developed seizures. Behavioral problems were reported in the following percentages of patients: 37% aggression, 22% impulsivity, 4.9% anxiety, 22% depression, 29.3% irritability, 24.4% behavioral regression. The proportion of patients receiving interventions are as follows: IEP (68.3%), PT (78%), OT (80.5%), and ST (29.3%).

Information on age at puberty (pubertal onset define as the age at menarche in females and age at voice change and growing of pubic hair in males), lifestyles, environmental exposures, and past medical history was obtained from standard designed questionnaire by phone interview or during clinical surveillance.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The age of puberty onset was significantly lower in Ped-MS group and there was approximately 4-fold increase risk of MS with decreasing age at puberty (odds ratio (OR): 4.072, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.57-10.52).

However, longitudinal MRI studies in the pediatric population with demyelinating diseases are scarce.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To investigate the accumulation of new/enlarging lesions and changes in brain volume in a cohort of pediatric patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), clinical isolated syndromes (CIS), acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), and other neurological disorders (OND).</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> In this observational study, 62 patients (16 MS, 8 CIS, 19 ADEM and 19 OND) were enrolled and followed with clinical and 1.5T MRI examinations over 3 years. The OND group included 10 headache, 6 seizure and 3 CNS vasculitis patients. MRI was performed at baseline, with 2 and 3 years of follow-up. MRI analyses included estimation of T2, T1 and gadolinium (Gd) lesion outcomes and brain volume changes.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The CIS and MS patients were slightly older compared to ADEM and OND patients (p=0.004), and the average age at baseline was 11.3 years in all study groups. No differences between the groups was found in disease duration, with an average of 1.9 years since disease onset. At baseline, there were significant differences in T2 and T1 lesion number and volume (LVs) between the 4 groups, with MS patients presenting the greatest lesion number and LVs (p&#x0003c; 0.05). No significant baseline differences between the groups were found for normalized volumetric measures of whole brain, lateral ventricle (LVV) and thalamus. Over 3 years, MS patients developed an average of 8.6 new/enlarging cumulative T2 lesions, compared to 1.8 in OND and 0 in CIS and ADEM groups (p=0.002). Among the brain volume changes, there was a significantly greater enlargement of LVV over 3 years in MS (+21.6%) and CIS (+11.2%) patients, compared to OND (+4.5%) or ADEM (-8.4%) (p=0.016 between all groups).

In children, motor performance and physical activity are related. We hypothesize, that fatigue and physical disability lead to poor physical activity and subsequently to reduced exercise capacity and poor motor development.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> We aimed to evaluate extent of disability, fatigue, motor performance and exercise capacity in children with MS and post-ADEM.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Sixteen children (MS n=9, post-ADEM n=7), aged 4-17 years attending our pediatric MS centre, were retrospectively studied. Extent of disability was measured with Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), fatigue with Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory-Multidimensional Fatigue Scale (PedsQL MFS), motor performance with Movement-Assessment-Battery for Children second edition (MABCII), and exercise capacity with the Bruce protocol.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold></p><p><underline>EDSS</underline>: mean(SD) extent of disability in the total group is: 0.66(0.83); 0.61(0.74) in children with MS and 0.71(0.99) in children post-ADEM.</p><p><underline>PedsQL MFS</underline>: mean(SD) SDS total fatigue score was significantly below normal in the total group: -1.31(1.14); p&#x0003c; 0.001.

This makes it difficult to predict future disability. Consistent with the brain reserve hypothesis for cognitive decline, we show for the first time in a separate abstract that larger maximal lifetime brain growth (MLBG, estimated with intracranial volume) protects against physical disability measured with the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS).</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> We examined whether larger MLBG also protects against functional disability measured with the Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite (MSFC), which has gained prominence as a primary measure of functional outcome in MS research, including clinical trials.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Seventy-two women with relapse-onset MS (independent from our EDSS abstract) were assessed with the MSFC, which evaluates gait (25-Foot-Walk; Ambulation Index) and fine motor dexterity (Nine Hole Peg Test), as well as cognitive status (Symbol Digit Modalities Test). MRI measured MLBG (estimated with intracranial volume) and disease burden (normalized volumes of gray, white, total brain, deep gray matter). Stepwise regression predicted MSFC with demographics, disease burden (above), and MLBG. We then investigated whether MLBG was related to each separate component of the MSFC (e.g., gait).</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Better MSFC performance was predicted by larger normalized deep gray matter volume (less atrophy; R<sup>2</sup>&#x00394;=.072, p=.023) and larger MLBG (R<sup>2</sup>&#x00394;=.143, p=.001). Controlling for normalized deep gray matter volume, larger MLBG was associated with better gait (Ambulation Index, r<sub>p</sub> = .263, p = .027), better fine motor dexterity (r<sub>p</sub> = .331, p = .005), and better cognitive status (r<sub>p</sub> = .392, p = .001). In addition to Ambulation Index scores, larger MLBG was also linked to faster walking speed.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> We show that larger MLBG protects against impairments in gait, fine motor dexterity, and cognitive status measured with the MSFC. Together with our finding that larger MLBG protects against disability on the EDSS (separate abstract), these results provide the first evidence in any population that larger MLBG protects against physical disability (extending the brain reserve hypothesis from cognitive to physical function). Consideration of a patient&#x02019;s MLBG (easily estimated with intracranial volume) may improve prediction of physical disability, with implications for research and clinical practice.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section548-1352458514547846"><title>P759</title><sec id="section549-1352458514547846"><title>Factors that determine disease course: the symptomatic lesion matters. 1000 CIS subgroup analysis</title><p><underline>M Tintor&#x000e9;</underline><sup>1</sup>, &#x000c1; Rovira<sup>2</sup>, J R&#x000ed;o<sup>1</sup>, S Otero-Romero<sup>1,3</sup>, G Arrambide<sup>1</sup>, C Tur<sup>1</sup>, M Comabella<sup>1</sup>, C Nos<sup>1</sup>, M-J Ar&#x000e9;valo<sup>1</sup>, L Negrotto<sup>1</sup>, I Gal&#x000e1;n<sup>1</sup>, &#x000c0; Vidal-Jordana<sup>1</sup>, J Castill&#x000f3;<sup>1</sup>, F Palavra<sup>1</sup>, E Sim&#x000f3;n<sup>1</sup>, R Mitjana<sup>2</sup>, C Auger<sup>2</sup>, J Sastre-Garriga<sup>1</sup>, X Montalban<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Vall Hebron University Hospital, Multiple Sclerosis Centre of Catalonia, Neuroimmunology Department, Barcelona, Spain, <sup>2</sup>Vall Hebron University Hospital, Magnetic Resonance Unit, Neuroradiology Department, Barcelona, Spain, <sup>3</sup>Vall Hebron University Hospital, Preventive Medicine and Epidemiology Department, Barcelona, Spain</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> According to the 2010 McDonald criteria, &#x0201c;if a subject has a brainstem or spinal cord syndrome, the symptomatic lesions are excluded from the Criteria and do not contribute to lesion count&#x0201d;.

Patients were divided in three groups: patients with a normal brain MRI (0 brain lesions, n=261), patients with a brainstem syndrome and one single MRI lesion in the brainstem or cerebellum (n=20) and patients with an abnormal brain MRI (&#x02265; 1 lesion, n=673). For each group, we have studied the risk for developing clinically definite MS (CDMS), 2005 McDonald MS and disability accumulation using uni (hazard ratio-HR) and multi (adjusted HR-aHR) cox regression models adjusted by age, gender, oligoclonal bands (OB), and disease modifying treatment (DMT).

The role of MRI in the prediction of outcome in children with MS has been less well studied. Early predictors of outcome in children with multiple sclerosis have implications for clinical care and for identifying eligible children for clinical trials.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To determine MRI predictors of disability and time to second attack at first attack in children with MS.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Children younger than 16 years of age with an acute demyelinating syndrome (ADS) were enrolled at 23 sites into a national prospective study. Standardized clinical and MRI data were acquired at onset, 3, 6, and 12 months and annually after onset for 9 years. Children were diagnosed with MS according to McDonald criteria. Age at ADS onset, gender, date of second attack, Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score at most recent visit, and relapse count were extracted from the database. Baseline and serial MRI scans were evaluated using a standardized scoring tool. Clinical and MRI parameters that predict time to second attack and EDSS score were evaluated using Cox proportional hazards and linear regression models. Locally weighted scatterplot smoothing (LOWESS) was used to estimate best-fitting curves.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Of 358 children enrolled, 72 (20%) have been diagnosed with MS (mean observation: 4.0&#x000b1;2.2 years, range: 0.04-8.1 years; 26 (65%) female). Of 72 children with MS, 51 (71%) had a second attack. Mean annualized relapse rate was 0.85&#x000b1;0.94 (mean total relapses: 2.0&#x000b1; 1.0). The presence of &#x02265;1 persisting T1-hypointense lesion and &#x02265;1 periventricular lesion at onset predicted time to second attack (HR 2.32, 95% confidence interval 1.04-5.18). Two of &#x02265;1 periventricular lesion, &#x02265;1 intracallosal lesion, and &#x02265;1 T1-hypointense lesion predicted time to second attack (HR 2.49, 95% CI 0.99-6.31). In children followed &#x02265;4 years, the presence of brainstem lesions (R=0.39, 95% CI 0.07-0.71) and new T2 lesion count over the first 12-months following the first attack (R=0.36, 95% CI 0.03-0.69) were associated with EDSS score at most recent visit.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Specific MRI parameters present at onset are associated with time to second attack. Early involvement of clinically eloquent brain regions (brainstem), as well as early MRI indices of disease activity (new T2 lesions) are associated with increased disability in children with MS.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section552-1352458514547846"><title>P761</title><sec id="section553-1352458514547846"><title>Clinical and molecular markers that predict severity of relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) disease outcomes</title><p><underline>J Goyal</underline><sup>1</sup>, J Bienkowska<sup>1</sup>, R Hosur<sup>1</sup>, M Yang<sup>1</sup>, S Feng<sup>1</sup>, V Viglietta<sup>1</sup>, D Mikol<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Biogen Idec, Cambridge, MA, United States</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Despite extensive research efforts exploring predictors of MS disease course, there has been no systematic investigation of demographic, clinical, radiographic and laboratory data, which is possible through post-hoc analysis of clinical trials where such data was collected across the study population.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To identify markers associated with on-study relapses and/or disability progression over 2-years, using data derived from the placebo arms of two large contemporaneous phase III studies (DEFINE and CONFIRM).</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> We investigated the association of baseline demographic, disease and molecular variables with clinical outcomes of 771 placebo-treated RRMS subjects.

The current analysis will be expanded in the future with the addition of data from placebo subjects from other controlled trials, the scope of outcomes will be broadened using additional clinical and MRI data. Validation of these findings might enable stratification of patients according to disease severity and may eventually inform individualized treatment decisions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section554-1352458514547846"><title>P762</title><sec id="section555-1352458514547846"><title>Possible prognostic factors for visual function after optic neuritis</title><p><underline>GH Dale</underline><sup>1</sup>, K Bacher Svendsen<sup>1</sup>, T Bek<sup>1</sup>, T Petersen<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Acute optic neuritis (ON) may lead to permanent visual impairment, but suitable markers for the visual prognosis are lacking.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To investigate whether contrast sensitivity, Rayleigh match anomaloscopy or retinal nerve fiber layer thickness (RNFLT) can be used as prognostic factors for visual function after acute ON.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Twenty-nine patients (18 female, 11 male) with acute ON were examined.

However, BCVA was still significantly worse in the group with worst baseline SR, compared to the MAN-group (mean -0,037 vs -0,18, p=0,012).</p><p>For RNFLT, there was no significant difference in BCVA between the two groups, neither at baseline (p = 0,53) nor at 6 months (p=0,16).

NEDA was defined by the absence of relapses, sustained EDSS progression, and new T2 or T1 gadolinium-enhancing lesions at annual intervals. Patients were analyzed independent of disease modifying therapy. There were 219 subjects with yearly brain MRI and biannual clinical visits. Spinal cord imaging was available for 162 (74%) and T25FW data for 145 (66%). The positive and negative predictive values (PPV, NPV) of NEDA for EDSS change&#x02264; 0.5 and no significant T25FW change at 7 years were calculated annually. Significant change in T25FW was defined by an increase of at least 20% in the walk time relative to the baseline measurement.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> 46.5% met criteria for NEDA at year 1 and 27.0% at year 2, but only 7.9% maintained NEDA at 7 years. None of the subjects&#x02019; baseline characteristics, including gender, race, age, disease duration and EDSS, significantly predicted NEDA at 2 and 7 years. For each year, assessment of spinal cord activity led to additional losses of 7-11% in the share of subjects free from MRI activity. The PPV of NEDA was 71.7% at year 1, and 79.3% at year 2 for EDSS change&#x02264; 0.5 at 7 years; it was 82.3% at year 1 and 74.3% at year 2 for change in T25FW. The NPV of NEDA was 43.0% at year 1 and 43.3% at year 2 for EDSS change&#x02264;0.5 at 7 years; it was 27.8% at year 1 and 22.2% at year 2 for change in T25FW.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> It is difficult to maintain NEDA long-term, but even when assessed during the first 2 years NEDA has good predictive power for long-term freedom from progression. However, loss of NEDA does not strongly predict a poor prognosis and thus should not be used to guide clinical decision making in favor of aggressive treatment. In this analysis, EDSS was a more stable measure of long-term disability status than T25FW changes. Further work is necessary to validate these findings using longitudinal cohort data with extended follow-up, ideally of &#x0003e;15 years.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section558-1352458514547846"><title>P764</title><sec id="section559-1352458514547846"><title>Early brain volume loss on interferon predicts disability progression after 4 years</title><p><underline>F P&#x000e9;rez-Miralles</underline><sup>1</sup>, J Sastre-Garriga<sup>1</sup>, &#x000c0; Vidal-Jordana<sup>1</sup>, D Pareto<sup>2</sup>, J R&#x000ed;o<sup>1</sup>, M Tintor&#x000e9;<sup>1</sup>, C Auger<sup>2</sup>, &#x000c1; Rovira<sup>2</sup>, X Montalban<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Vall Hebron University Hospital, Multiple Sclerosis Centre of Catalonia, Neuroimmunology Department, Barcelona, Spain, <sup>2</sup>Vall Hebron University Hospital, Magnetic Resonance Unit, Neuroradiology Department, Barcelona, Spain</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> At a trial level, the effect of MS therapies on brain volume loss, in addition to new lesion accrual, has been correlated with their effect on disability progression.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To investigate the association between global and regional (gray and white matter) brain volume loss during the first year of interferon treatment and clinical outcome at 2 and 4 years.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> We selected 105 na&#x000ef;ve MS patients started on interferon-&#x003b2; (brain MRI scans performed in the 3 months prior and 12 months after therapy onset), and followed-up for at least 48 months.

Demographic (age), clinical (Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite-MSFC, Expanded Disability Status Scale-EDSS) and neuropsychological (French adaptation of the Brief Repeatable Battery-BRB) variables were recorded.

However, not all patients with CIS will go on to develop multiple sclerosis (MS). The uncertainty about whether or not a CIS patient will develop MS is problematic both for the wellbeing of patients and for the decision to start treatment early in the course of the disease. With the most recent revisions to the diagnostic criteria for MS, the diagnosis of MS can already be made after one attack in a subgroup of patients with specific abnormalities on the brain MRI scan. However, this subgroup includes only a minority of CIS patients, leaving most patients still in the dark.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To create a simple and reliable prediction model for MS in patients with CIS.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> 431 CIS patients were included within 6 months after symptom onset. Potential predictors were chosen a priori based on existing literature and clinical experience. The outcome measure was clinically definite MS (CDMS) as defined by Poser and colleagues. A multivariate Cox regression model was created after univariate screening of candidate predictors and then further simplified using stepwise backward selection. A simple scoring system was then constructed giving equal weight to all predictors.

The main outcome was an increase EDSS&#x02265;1.5 (progressive) or not (non-progressive) at up to five years after baseline visit. Classification models used baseline features only or additional longitudinal clinical and brain MRI data. We used the machine learning technique, support vector machines (SVM), to build prediction models classifying MS patients into those with or without progression during the follow-up period. Bagging and undersampling of the larger non-progressive class and cost misclassification to reduce false negatives in the progressive group, were applied. Subgroups of patients, based on baseline EDSS were evaluated.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Using baseline data alone, SVM models performed no better than random. In patients with baseline EDSS&#x0003c; 4, additional clinical observation for one year improved overall accuracy in predicting non-progressive cases (65-74%).

With further clinical follow-up over 2 years, the accuracy of predicting non-progressive MS improved (77-79%), with no benefit of adding MRI information (74-76%). Demographic features of race, ethnicity and family history of MS ranked highly as predictors of non-progressive MS.

All the CIS patients who entered the study showed &#x02265;2 oligoclonal bands in cerebrospinal fluid and &#x02265;2 hyperintense T2 lesions at disease onset. Multivariate Cox proportional hazard models were used to analyze predictors of CDMS and SDP (confirmed after 6 months) between months 6 and 48.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Greater T2 lesion volume (HR 1.81; p =.005) and presence of contrast-enhanced (CE) lesions (HR 2.13; p &#x0003c; .001) at baseline were significantly associated with increased cumulative risk of conversion to CDMS over 48 months. Greater atrophy of the corpus callosum (CC) area (HR 2.74; p =.001) and greater increase of lateral ventricle volume (HR 2.43; p =.002) at 6 months relative to baseline were associated with increased cumulative risk of conversion to CDMS between months 6 and 48.

Enlargement of the lateral ventricles was also associated with SDP.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section572-1352458514547846"><title>P771</title><sec id="section573-1352458514547846"><title>Predictors of disability accrual in multiple sclerosis patients on first-line therapy</title><p><underline>T Spelman</underline><sup>1</sup>, V Jokubaitis<sup>1</sup>, G Izquierdo<sup>2</sup>, P Duquette<sup>3</sup>, F Grand&#x02019;Maison<sup>4</sup>, P Grammond<sup>5</sup>, R Hupperts<sup>6</sup>, E Havrdova<sup>7</sup>, C Oreja-Guevara<sup>8</sup>, R Alroughani<sup>9</sup>, T Petersen<sup>10</sup>, J Lechner-Scott<sup>11</sup>, C Boz<sup>12</sup>, H Butzkueven<sup>1</sup>, A Lugaresi<sup>13</sup>, M Trojano<sup>14</sup>, for the MSBase Study Group</p><p><sup>1</sup>University of Melbourne, Melbourne Brain Centre, Parkville, Australia, <sup>2</sup>Hospital Universitario Virgen Macarena, Sevilla, Spain, <sup>3</sup>H&#x000f4;pital Notre Dame, Montreal, QC, Canada, <sup>4</sup>Neuro Rive-Sud, H&#x000f4;pital Charles LeMoyne, Greenfield Park, QC, Canada, <sup>5</sup>Center de R&#x000e9;adaptation D&#x000e9;ficience Physique Chaudi&#x000e8;re-Appalache, Levis, QC, Canada, <sup>6</sup>Orbis Medical Centre, Sittard-Geleen, Netherlands, <sup>7</sup>General University Hospital and Charles University, Department of Neurology and Center of Clinical Neuroscience, Prague, Czech Republic, <sup>8</sup>University Hospital San Carlos, Madrid, Spain, <sup>9</sup>Amiri Hospital, Kuwait, Kuwait, <sup>10</sup>Kommunehospitalet, Arhus C, Denmark, <sup>11</sup>John Hunter Hospital, Newcastle, Australia, <sup>12</sup>Karadeniz Technical University, Trabzon, Turkey, <sup>13</sup>University &#x02018;G. d&#x02019;Annunzio&#x02019;, MS Center, Department of Neuroscience and Imaging, Chieti, Italy, <sup>14</sup>University of Bari, Department of Basic Medical Sciences, Neuroscience and Sense Organs, Bari, Italy</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> A principal objective when managing the clinical care of people with multiple sclerosis (MS) is to prevent the irreversible accumulation of neurological disability. Clinical trials provide evidence for clinical efficacy of disease modifying therapies (DMT) in reducing disease burden, however, the results of clinical trials are based on well-controlled environments, rigorous patient review, and do not necessarily reflect real-world patient characteristics or behaviours. Predictors of long-term EDSS score change in a cohort of patients treated with first-line disease modifying therapies in a real-world clinical setting is not known.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To identify predictors of expanded disability status scale (EDSS) change in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) treated with any interferon-beta (IFN&#x003b2;) preparation or glatiramer acetate (GA) as a first therapy.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Data were extracted from the MSBase Registry. Median EDSS changes over 5 year (n=3367) and 8-year (n=1870) periods were determined. Predictors of EDSS change were analysed using adjusted quantile median regression. Continuation on first-line therapy was not a condition for remaining in the analysis.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> High relapse activity was the principal driver of 5 and 8-year post-baseline disability score increases. Duration of use of first-line DMTs was associated with decreased accrual of disability over the long-term. Annualised relapse rate (ARR) was highly predictive of increases in median EDSS score over both 5-year (coefficient (<italic>coeff</italic>) 0.63, p&#x0003c; 0.000) and 8-year (<italic>coeff</italic> 0.47, p&#x0003c; 0.000) periods. Additionally, on unadjusted analysis, on-treatment relapses in the first 5 years (<italic>coeff</italic> 0.53, p&#x0003c; 0.000), but not 8 years were predictive of an EDSS increase. Increasing proportion of the observation period on DMT therapy was associated with a significant decrease in EDSS change at 5 and 8 years (<italic>coeff</italic> -0.67, p&#x0003c; 0.000; -0.32, p=0.012), respectively. Additionally, pregnancy was shown to correlate with a decrease in EDSS score within the first 5 years of observation (p=0.001).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> In this real-world cohort of patients observed for 5 and 8 years after first DMT initiation, high ARR, particularly early on-treatment relapse activity, is a poor prognostic indicator. Pregnancy and the use of first-line disease modifying therapy, however, are associated with a protective effect against 5 and 8 year EDSS increase.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="section574-1352458514547846"><title>PROs and QOL</title><sec id="section575-1352458514547846"><title>P772</title><sec id="section576-1352458514547846"><title>Psychosocial factors affecting quality of life in multiple sclerosis - a review of the current evidence base</title><p><underline>CA Young</underline><sup>1,2</sup>, R Edwards<sup>2</sup>, TONiC Study Group</p><p><sup>1</sup>The Walton Centre Foundation Trust, Liverpool, United Kingdom, <sup>2</sup>University of Liverpool, Liverpool, United Kingdom</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Multiple sclerosis (MS) may have a significant impact on a patient&#x02019;s quality of life (QOL), those with MS report having a poorer quality of life than the general population. Several psychosocial factors may be possible contributors to the observed deterioration of QOL in MS.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> The aim was to analyse the current literature on the contribution of various psychosocial factors on QOL in MS.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Literature searches were conducted in Medline, Science Direct and Psych Info for articles on MS, quality of life, psychosocial factors and a series of psychosocial factors identified from the literature search. All primary studies published in English were eligible. Each database was searched up to 1 April 2014. Exclusion criteria included reviews, duplicate publications and papers on measurement of psychosocial factors or QOL, as opposed to the relationship <italic>per se</italic>.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> 137 papers yielded 30 studies on the potential influence of psychosocial factors on QOL in MS. Assessment of the relative importance of the factors is impaired because several factors are little studied, such as coping and self efficacy. The factors most frequently examined for effect on QOL were depression, employment status and cognitive impairment. Contributory factors ranked in order of number of papers examining the topic and finding a relationship to QOL were depression (15 out of 15 studies), employment (10 out of 11 studies), cognitive function (9 out of 10 studies), education (6 out of 7 studies), and fatigue (5 out of 5 studies). In addition, some factors may contribute to QOL in MS but appear to have been under-researched. These included anxiety (4 out of 4 studies) and obsessive compulsiveness disorders (1 study). Gender, age and marital status did not appear to influence QOL.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Current research determining factors affecting QOL in MS shows strong evidence in support of depression having a detrimental impact upon QOL in this population. However it is also evident that the literature focuses on a limited number of psychosocial factors. Future research needs to consider a wider range of psychosocial factors in order to gain a more holistic picture of what contributes to QOL in MS and hence determine possible ways in which this can be improved.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section577-1352458514547846"><title>P773</title><sec id="section578-1352458514547846"><title>Personality traits predict the perceived health-related quality of life in persons with multiple sclerosis</title><p><underline>IR Zarbo</underline><sup>1,2</sup>, S Demontis<sup>3</sup>, G Carpentras<sup>3</sup>, M Pugliatti<sup>2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>University of Sassari, Department of Biomedical Sciences, Sassari, Italy, <sup>2</sup>University of Sassari, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Sassari, Italy, <sup>3</sup>AOU Sassari, Unit of Psychology, Sassari, Italy</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Neuropsychiatric disorders have been reported in persons with MS (PwMS) and found in association with brain morphostructural changes. Personality traits (eg., neuroticism) can affect the health related quality of life (HRQoL) in different disorders. Personality as defined by Eysenck is the sum of the actual or potential behavior patterns of the organism, as determined by heredity and environment, developing through the interaction of cognitive, conative, affective and somatic sectors. In MS, personality traits can determine patients&#x02019; willingness to take on more risky treatment options, predispose to neuropsychiatric symptoms and affect coping strategies</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> We aimed to investigate the role of personality traits as possible predictors of HRQoL in a large cohort of PwMS.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> PwMS (Poser Committee criteria), consecutively recruited at the MS Center, Sassari University Hospital between January 1st 2004 and April 30th 2004, were asked consent to study participation. Raven Colored Progressive Matrices (RCPM) test and the STAI-X1 were used to screen for major intellectual deficits and state anxiety. PwMS&#x02019; self-perceived mental and physical health status was measured with the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36). The personality profile was assessed with the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (EPQ-R) yielding scores for extraversion/introversion, neuroticism, psychoticism and lie. The correlation between HSQoL and personality traits was investigated by means of analysis of variance, with the SF-36 aggregated mental (MCS) and physical (PCS) scores as dependent variables and the EPQ-R subscales scores as independent variables, adjusting for possible confounders or effect modifiers (gender, age, trait anxiety, depression, degree of disability, education).

Several factors have known associations with HRQoL in MS (e.g. sex, age, disability status). While comorbid medical conditions are common in MS little is known about their impact on quality of life.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> We investigated relationships among factors known to affect HRQoL in MS, and the presence of comorbid illnesses.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> From July 2010 through March 2011, 949 consecutive adult patients with definite MS attending routine visits were recruited at 4 participating provincial MS Clinics across Canada (British Columbia, Alberta, Manitoba and Nova Scotia). The Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score was recorded on the day of recruitment; all participants completed the Health Utilities Index Mark III (HUI) as a generic utility measure of HRQoL, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), the Daily Fatigue Impact Scale (D-FIS), and a previously validated questionnaire documenting lifetime diagnoses of 21 comorbidities.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> 75.2% of the sample was female and 72.4% had relapsing-remitting MS. The mean (SD) age was 48.6 (11.4) years, mean MS duration was 15.4 (10.2) years and median (IQR) EDSS was 2.5 (1.5-5.0). 56% reported at least1 physical comorbidity. The mean (SD) HUI score was 0.54 (0.32) with 63% of the sample falling into the category of severe disability (&#x0003c; 0.70). Mean (SD) HADS-Depression and HADS-Anxiety scores were 4.72 (3.57) and 6.56 (4.06); mean (SD) D-FIS score was 12.5 (8.24). Regression analyses showed that number of comorbidities, EDSS, self-rated anxiety, depression and fatigue were each associated with HUI scores. A multiple regression model including these factors as well as sex and age accounted for a large proportion of variance in HUI scores (F=145.44, p&#x0003c; .0001, adjusted R<sup>2</sup>=0.62).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Neurologic disability, mental health symptoms, fatigue, and comorbidity were all associated with HRQoL in this representative clinic-attending sample of persons with MS. Together, these factors account for a large proportion of variance in self-rated HRQoL. Comorbid illnesses and symptoms of anxiety, depression and fatigue all represent potentially modifiable factors that may provide targets for improving HRQoL in persons with MS. A better understanding of both direct and indirect effects of these factors on HRQoL will help prioritize strategies for improving MS care.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section581-1352458514547846"><title>P775</title><sec id="section582-1352458514547846"><title>Validity of the Neuro-QOL lower extremity and upper-extremity scales in persons with MS with a range of cognitive disability as measured by the SDMT</title><p><underline>DM Miller</underline><sup>1</sup>, B Mamone<sup>1</sup>, L Mourany<sup>2</sup>, SM Rao<sup>2</sup>, RA Rudick<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Cleveland Clinic, Mellen Center/Neurology, Cleveland, OH, United States, <sup>2</sup>Cleveland Clinic, Center for Brain Health/Neurology, Cleveland, OH, United States</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Neuro-QOL is a set of self-reported measures that assess health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of adults and children with neurological disorders. The measures have undergone extensive psychometric testing but their performance in persons with multiple sclerosis (MS) with a range of cognitive impairment has not been fully assessed in 2 of the 13 Neuro-QOL measures, Upper Extremity Function (UEF) and Lower Extremity Function (LEF). These 2Neuro-QOL measures were included in a study to validate iPad analogs of the Timed-25-Foot Walk (T-25-FW), 9-Hole Peg Test (9-HPT), and Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT). Non-computerized versions of the T-25FW, 9-HPT and SDMT were also administered and their results were used in the current analysis.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To assess the relationships of the UEF and 9-HPT and the LEF and T-25-FW while controlling for cognitive processing speed as measured by the SDMT in this iPad validation sample. There were no cognitive exclusion or inclusion criteria for study entry but subjects, according to the MSFC protocol, had to complete the T-25-FW in 180 seconds and the 9-HPT in 300 seconds.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Descriptive statistics were analyzed. Pearson correlations were calculated for the UEF and 9-HPT and for the LEF and T-25-FW followed by partial correlations controlling for the SDMT.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Data were available for 50 subjects. Most were female (80%), Caucasian (86%), with relapsing remitting disease (68%). Mean age=45.8 yrs (SD=10.1), mean education=15.0 yrs (SD=2.3) and mean disease duration=12.21 yrs (SD=9.1). Mean T-25-FW=7.1 (range 3.20-27.0), mean 9-HPT=23.0 sec. (range 13.8- 43.3), mean SDMT=54.3 (range 32- 78). Mean UEF raw score=37.6 (T-score=41.2), mean LEF raw score=34.0 (T-score=42.8). The 9-PHT and UEF correlation was r=&#x02212; 0.43, p=0.002, while the partial correlation correcting for SDMT was r=&#x02212;0.38, p=0.008. For the T-25-FW and LEF correlation was r=&#x02212; 0.55, p&#x0003c; 0.0001, while the partial was r=&#x02212;0.518, p&#x0003c; 0.0001. There were no statistical differences between the r and partial r correlations for either set of comparisons.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The association between self-reported UEF and 9-HPT and self-reported LEF and T-25-FW are highly correlated and not affected by cognitive processing speed as measured by the SDMT.

The mean (SD) age for these patients was 44.43 (11.18) and 73.57% were female. The PRO battery included The Center of for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D, 20 items), MOS Modified Social Support Survey (MSSS, 18 items), Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS, 21 items) and Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life - 54 (MSQOL-54, 54 items). Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) was used to identify latent constructs within the battery. We utilized the promax oblique rotation because the hypothetical constructs of the items were believed to be inter-related. Kaiser-Guttman&#x02019;s &#x0003e; 1.0 eigenvalue rule, proportion of common variance, and scree test were used to determine the ideal final factor model.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The EFA yielded a 10-factor solution, and this accounted for 84.1% of the total variance in our data. Items from the MSSS loaded (&#x0003e;.8) on a single factor, without any items from other scales. Items on the MFIS did not load on a single factor, rather the items measuring cognitive fatigue loaded together with the cognitive functioning items from the MSQOL-54. The items measuring physical and psychosocial fatigue loaded together with the physical functioning items of the MSQOL-54. The five items from the Mental Health subscale of MSQOL-54 were found to have strong association to items in the CES-D scale. The remaining MSQOL-54 items loaded on separate factors as expected. Finally, all items from the Tangible Support subscale of MSSS also loaded (&#x0003e;.5) on a distinct factor.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> These findings demonstrate that the PROs given to MS patients participating in CLIMB are interrelated and could be assessed utilizing a smaller number of items.

The primary endpoint is a composite of the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), Timed 25-Foot Walk (T25FW), and Nine-Hole Peg Test. In addition to EDSS and T25FW, another objective measure of ambulatory impairment in ASCEND is the 6-Minute Walk Test (6MWT). The MSWS-12 is also assessed to measure the impact of MS on walking from the patient&#x02019;s perspective (range: 0-100; higher score=more impairment). Patients with SPMS for &#x02265;2 years, EDSS score 3.0-6.5, Multiple Sclerosis Severity Score &#x02265;4.0, and documented evidence of disease progression independent of relapse within the prior year were eligible to enroll.

The battery includesthe Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Rating Scale (CES-D) and Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS). The MFIS was added to the PRO battery in 2006. For inclusion in this study, subjects were required to have completed PRO questionnaires for four consecutive years after the MFIS was added to the battery (n=351 for CES-D and n=343 for MFIS). The baseline mean (SD) of age of the subjects was 45.4 (10.7), the baseline mean (SD) disease duration was 12.3 (8.2) years, and 25.4% of the subjects were male. For the CES-D and MFIS, the sum of all available items was used for analysis. Longitudinal changes in the mean CES-D and MFIS scores were assessed using a linear mixed effects regression model with a categorical effect of time and random intercept to account for the within patient correlation.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The estimated mean CES-D score at baseline was 29.6 (where the minimum CES-D score is 20). The estimated mean CES-D score decreased significantly after baseline (p&#x0003c; 0.05 for comparison of each time point to baseline). After baseline, the CES-D score remained generally constant (28.8 at year 1, 28.6 at year 2, 28.8 at year 3, and 28.4 at year 4). For the MFIS, the estimated mean at baseline was 26.4, and a significant decrease in the mean score between baseline and the subsequent time points was observed (p&#x0003c; 0.05 for comparison of each time point to baseline). As with the CES-D, the estimated mean MFIS remained constant after baseline (24.4 at year 1, 24.7 at year 2, 25.0 at year 3, 24.8 at year 4).

Fatigue may occur with any severity in up to 90% of MS patients. Both cognitive impairment and fatigue can have a serious negative impact on patients&#x02019; lives. Subcutaneous (SC) interferon (IFN) beta-1a can slow disability progression, and has also been reported to stabilize or delay cognitive impairment in most patients with mild relapsing MS.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To evaluate cognitive function in patients with relapsing-remitting MS treated with SC IFN beta-1a, and its relationship to fatigue and neurological disability status.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> This was an observational, prospective, multicenter study. Patients aged 18-65 years treated by SC IFN beta-1a were followed at 13 MS centers in the Czech Republic. Cognition was evaluated using the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT), fatigue by the Fatigue Descriptive Scale (FDS), and neurological disability by the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), all at baseline (BL) and Months 6, 12, and 24. Data were evaluated using descriptive statistics, and a relationship among the PASAT, FDS, and EDSS scores was assessed using Spearman&#x02019;s correlation coefficient.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> A total number of 300 patients entered the study; 272 completed 2-years&#x02019; follow-up. The proportion of patients with increased or stable PASAT score (no decline in cognition) versus BL was 61% at Month 24. The mean (standard deviation; SD) PASAT score was 48.49 (9.02) at BL and 49.98 (8.00) at Month 24. The proportion of patients with decreased or stable FDS score (no increase in fatigue) versus BL was 64% at Month 24. The mean (SD) FDS score was 3.58 (3.66) at BL and 3.68 (3.82) at Month 24. The proportion of patients with decreased and stable EDSS at Month 24 compared to BL was 31% and 33%, respectively. Using Spearman&#x02019;s correlation coefficient, no very high, high, or moderate correlation was found among EDSS, PASAT and FDS scores and its changes.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> This study suggests stable or improved cognition, fatigue, and disability in the majority of patients treated with SC IFN beta-1a throughout 2 years&#x02019; follow-up, with about 30% of patients experiencing EDSS improvement.

Herewith we report design and first results of a test study on patient-reported outcomes (PRO) that was developed to address one of the four EUReMS missions, namely the &#x0201c;assessment of PwMS&#x02019; quality of life (QoL), burden of symptoms and socio-economic aspects from the patient&#x02019;s perspective&#x0201d;.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To show whether it is feasible to collect PRO data in a considerable number of PwMS on a European level, and to identify differences in QoL and employment between participating countries.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> After identifying the existing registers in Europe, questionnaires and semi-structured interviews were conducted in order to assess the register&#x02019;s heterogeneity and their ability to participate. Based on these results, four registers (Germany, Poland, Sweden and UK) were identified to participate in the first stage of this study. A set of variables was identified in close cooperation between the registers and the Department of Medical Informatics at the University Medical Center in G&#x000f6;ttingen, Germany, which represents the required information on demographics, basic disease characteristics, PRO data (i. e. EQ5d, MSIS-29), and data on employment.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> A EUReMS database was set up, and import frameworks were developed providing information on specifications and definitions for data items, guidance on data anonymization and data transfer, and supported export formats. Standard routines were developed to harmonize the heterogeneous datasets from different registers by mapping the national register data to the EUReMS PRO dataset and according metadata. Data transfer is being performed by a file transfer service. To refine procedures for data harmonization and data analyses, the registers were asked to transmit test data. The statistical models for comparing the register data between European countries were defined according to the hypotheses that have been formulated by the EUReMS group. Data are now analysed, first results will be presented during the meeting.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The test phase of this EUReMS study will enable the consortium to (1) improve processes and tools for the integration and comprehensive analyses of PRO data from different sources across Europe, (2) show whether it is feasible to collect PRO data in a considerable number of PwMS on a European level, and (3) compare QoL and employment of PwMS in selected European countries.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section595-1352458514547846"><title>P782</title><sec id="section596-1352458514547846"><title>How do lower urinary tract symptoms affect quality of life in multiple sclerosis: a systematic review of the literature</title><p><underline>CA Young</underline><sup>1,2</sup>, HL Watson<sup>2</sup>, TONiC Study Group</p><p><sup>1</sup>The Walton Centre Foundation Trust, Liverpool, United Kingdom, <sup>2</sup>University of Liverpool, Liverpool, United Kingdom</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> 70-80% of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) will experience some lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) during the course of the disease. In light of this, there has been research interest over recent years regarding how LUTS in MS affect health related quality of life.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> We conducted a systematic literature review to determine how LUTS impact on quality of life (QoL) in MS patients, in preparation for the Trajectories of Outcome in Neurological Conditions (TONiC) study, a British multicentre study of QOL in MS.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Literature searches were conducted in Medline, Web of Science, Scopus, CINAHL and PsycInfo to identify studies, published from 1900 to March 2014 inclusive, primarily assessing how LUTS affect QoL in MS patients. In addition to this, the references sections of selected studies were reviewed to identify any further articles of value. Studies were excluded from analysis if their primary aim was to evaluate the effect of a therapy on QoL or to validate the use of a specific measure to evaluate QoL.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> 23 potential studies were identified; of these, 20 met exclusion criteria (reviews, case studies, diseases other than MS, outcomes other than QOL, not published in English). This left three studies meeting the eligibility criteria. Four additional articles were identified from references. These 7 studies examined the effect of LUTS on QOL in a total of 1459 MS patients. Six studies suggested that the presence of LUTS in MS patients significantly adversely affects QoL, all showed that the three domains most commonly affected were physical functioning, vitality/fatigue and social activity limitation. One study found no relation between LUTs and QOL, despite using the Short Form 36 (SF-36) which had shown a relation between LUTS and QOL in 3 other studies. The discrepancy may be due to under-estimation of the range of LUTS, as the negative study only assessed one urinary symptom (self-reported degree of incontinence).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Comparison of studies was challenging due to heterogeneity in study design and outcome measures, but there is preliminary evidence that LUTS do adversely impact on QoL for people with MS. Further studies are warranted to confirm findings and identify QoL domains most affected. These would be improved by utilising an MS-specific urinary symptom measure, such as the SF-Qualiveen, in order to sensitively assess the broad range of urinary symptoms encountered in this population.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section597-1352458514547846"><title>P783</title><sec id="section598-1352458514547846"><title>Identifying an important change threshold for the Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale-12 (MSWS-12)</title><p><underline>L Mehta</underline><sup>1</sup>, M McNeill<sup>2</sup>, J Hobart<sup>3</sup>, K Wyrwich<sup>4</sup>, JL Poon<sup>4</sup>, P Auguste<sup>4</sup>, ZJ Zhong<sup>1</sup>, J Elkins<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Biogen Idec, Cambridge, MA, United States, <sup>2</sup>Biogen Idec, Maidenhead, United Kingdom, <sup>3</sup>Plymouth University Peninsula Schools of Medicine and Dentistry, Plymouth, United Kingdom, <sup>4</sup>Evidera, Bethesda, MD, United States</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> The 12-item Multiple Sclerosis (MS) Walking Scale (MSWS-12) is currently the only patient-reported outcome measure specifically assessing the impact of MS on walking. Estimating the magnitude of what is often referred to as the minimum clinically important difference (MCID) on the MSWS-12 is important for the appropriate interpretation of MSWS-12 results. More recently, the term responder definition (RD) is often applied to describe the individual patient score change over a predetermined time period that should be interpreted as a treatment benefit.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> Pre-specified summed score analyses estimated the MCID/RD threshold for interpreting individual change over time on the MSWS-12 in MS patients with walking impairment (defined as having as Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score of 4-7) participating in the 24-week double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized MOBILE trial of fampridine-PR.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Both anchor- and distribution-based approaches were used to estimate the MCID/RD using the data collected at Week 2 and at subsequent monthly administrations of the MSWS-12 and other walking-related endpoints in MOBILE. Relevant improvements on: 1) the Patient Global Impression of Change and 2) the EuroQol-5D-5L mobility question were selected as anchors for estimating the MCID/RD of the MSWS-12. The distribution-based estimate of the MCID/RD was the standard error of measurement (SEM). Iterative comparisons (triangulation) of the anchor- and distribution-based estimates with observed breaks in blinded change score data from the MOBILE trial allowed for the estimation of a single best value for the MCID/RD.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The anchor-based methods yielded median changes/reductions between 5.2 and 9.7 points on the MSWS-12 for small but important changes in walking ability. The distribution-based MCID/RD estimate was 6.8 points (one SEM). Through the triangulation process, a reduction of 8 points on the MSWS-12 was selected as the best estimate of the MCID/RD in these patients.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> These findings indicate that an 8-point reduction on the MSWS-12 provides a reasonable threshold for estimating whether an MS subject with walking impairment (defined as having an EDSS between 4 and 7) enrolled in the MOBILE trial had experienced a meaningful improvement in their self-reported ability to walk over 24 weeks. The generalizability of this finding to other MS patients, such as those with milder walking disability, and other studies, deserves future investigation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section599-1352458514547846"><title>P784</title><sec id="section600-1352458514547846"><title>Psychometric testing of the early mobility impairment questionnaire for multiple sclerosis</title><p><underline>T Ziemssen</underline><sup>1</sup>, A Mathias<sup>2</sup>, C Coon<sup>2</sup>, S Agarwal<sup>3</sup>, R Shah<sup>4</sup>, G Phillips<sup>3</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Center of Clinical Neuroscience, Dresden, Germany, <sup>2</sup>Adelphi Values, Boston, MA, United States, <sup>3</sup>Biogen Idec, Cambridge, MA, United States, <sup>4</sup>University of Mississippi, University, MS, United States</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Nearly all subjects (93%) with multiple sclerosis (MS) experience some degree of mobility impairment&#x02014;over half (58%) in the first year following diagnosis&#x02014;which can significantly diminish health-related quality of life. Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) is one measure but detects and quantifies late stage mobility impairment. A sizeable proportion of subjects (~40%) with MS &#x0201c;rarely or never&#x0201d; discuss walking difficulties with their healthcare providers (HCP). To facilitate discussion between subjects with MS and their HCPs, and improve identification of early mobility limitations, the Early Mobility Impairment Questionnaire (EMIQ) was developed based on qualitative research in patients with MS and in collaboration with key opinion leaders.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To evaluate the psychometric properties of the 15-item EMIQ, including derivation of a scoring algorithm as well as clinical thresholds for subject screening.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> The instrument&#x02019;s psychometric performance was evaluated in a multi-center, prospective, non-interventional observational study. Subjects with MS who were 18-65 years of age, spoke English, and had an EDSS score of 2.0 to 6.0 were eligible to participate. Subjects completed a series of questionnaires over two study visits one week apart. In addition to an item-level analysis and subsequent item reduction using discriminant validity, factor analysis, and item response theory, a scoring algorithm was developed and the instrument&#x02019;s psychometric properties were evaluated.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> In total, 124 subjects were included in the study [males = 23%; age (mean) = 52 years; and EDSS score (mean) = 4.2].

The Multiple Sclerosis Knowledge Questionnaire (MSKQ) is a 25-item self-assessed instrument first developed and validated in Italian to test patient knowledge and understanding of MS. Further psychometric validation of the MSKQ in other populations is needed.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To assess the psychometric properties of the French version of MSKQ in a large cohort of patients with MS, using data from patients enrolled in the ADOPTE study.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> ADOPTE was an observational, prospective, longitudinal, multicenter study conducted in France by 99 neurologists. A total of 389 adult patients with MS initiating a treatment with intramuscular interferon beta-1a were enrolled. Psychometric properties of the MSKQ, including quality of completion, construct validity and internal consistency were assessed on 233 patients who completed the MSKQ at 6-month visit. MSKQ score is obtained by summing the number of correct answers (range: 0-25).</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Mean age of patients who completed the MSKQ was 39.2 (+/-10.1) years and 80.2% were female. Median time between MS diagnosis and MSKQ completion was 1.4 years (Min-Max: 0.5-35.0). Median Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score was 1.0 (Min-Max: 0.0-6.5). The number of missing responses per questionnaire ranged from 0 to 8, and 13.3% of MSKQ collected had &#x02265;1 missing responses. For each of the 25 items, the percentage of correct answers ranged from 22.5% to 100.0%. Mean MSKQ score was 15.7 (+/-3.9, Min-Max: 3-24). Overall, 8 items had good discriminating properties (percentage of correct answers between 30-80% and correlation Item - Total score &#x0003e;=0.3). Internal consistency was acceptable (Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha: 0.74). The unidimensionality of the MSKQ, evaluated by principal component analysis, was not confirmed (only 15.8% of variance explained by the 1<sup>st</sup> axis). MSKQ score was significantly higher in women, in patients with higher educational levels and in patients with higher socio-professional categories.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Analyses of psychometric properties of the French version of the MSKQ showed satisfactory results. However, several items were poorly discriminant. Some of them were kept by MSKQ authors for their clinical and educational interest, others may be removed from the questionnaire.

Furthermore, there are concerns regarding the validity and reliability of the most widely used measure for spasticity - the Ashworth scale. The Leeds Spasticity Scale (LSS) is an 8 item patient-reported, interval-level scale, which was developed in a population with post-stroke spasticity. It has not been previously validated in MS.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To examine the construct validity of the LSS in an MS population using Rasch analysis.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> The LSS was given to 401 patients with MS across three neuroscience centres in the UK. Three subscales (muscle stiffness, pain and muscle spasms) from the MS Spasticity Scale-88 (MSSS-88) and a numerical rating scale (NRS) for spasticity were co-administered.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> 213 records were available for analysis (53.1% response). 37.7% had progressive type of MS and 14.6% had EDSS&#x0003e;6.5. 56.1% had moderate (NRS 4-6) or severe (NRS 7-10) spasticity There was good fit to the Rasch model of the unmodified scale although low levels of item dependency were found between items 1 and 2, and 5, 6 and 7. This was remedied by testlet structuring of those item sets. The final scale had ordered category response thresholds, non-significant chi-square fit, a person separation index of 0.85 (meaning suitable for individual use) and was unidimensional according to post-hoc t-test. The scale was free from differential item functioning for a variety of important person factors (age, sex, Extended Disability Status Score, MS type).

Ruck et al., 2013 found a positive effect on fatigue (MFSC) after 14 days of treatment, which lasts 9 and 12 months. Prugger et.al, 2013 shows an effect on fatigue (FSS) only at 6 months. The effect on spasticity has been studied by Goodman et al., 2010 without significant treatment effect on the Ashworth score at 14 days.</p><p>Improvement in nerve conduction in demyelinated axons associated with decrease in conduction blocks may partially explain the improvement in fatigue and spasticity.

However, there have been limited studies on evaluation of HRQoL in NMOSD.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> The purpose of this study was to evaluate HRQoL in NMOSD and to compare HRQoL in NMOSD with in MS.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Patients with NMOSD were recruited from June 2009 and February 2010 at the National Cancer Center in Korea. Patients were evaluated at the study entry via Korean validated self-questionnaires on HRQoL (MSIS-29, MusiQoL). Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS-9) and the depression Questionnaire (PHQ-9), expanded disability status scale (EDSS) and social characteristics were also implemented. We assessed the relationship of these parameters with age, gender, education level, disability and disease duration and also compared fifty-six patients with MS derived from our previous study.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> In total, 96 patients (female 89.6 %) with NMOSD were studied. The median age was 40.3&#x000b1;10.3 years, mean disease duration was 7.1&#x000b1;4.4 years and median EDSS score was 3&#x000b1;2. Twenty-six patients with NMOSD (27%) had depression and 50 (52%) had fatigue. EDSS were strongly associated with physical domain of MSIS-29 and MusiQoL (r=0.64~0.73, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c; 0.001). PHQ-9 was significantly correlated with psychologic domain of MSIS-29 and MusiQoL (r=0.72~0.84, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c; 0.001), followed by physical domain (r=0.57~0.59, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c; 0.001). FSS-9 was moderately correlated with Symptom and Global index of MusiQoL (r=0.51~0.54, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c; 0.001). Dimensions of MSIS-29 and MusiQoL were most impacted by financially dependence, followed by employment and education state. Marital and religion status did not influence, except for Sentimental and sexual life of MusiQoL. The comparison of demographic characteristics between MS and NMOSD demonstrated that age, EDSS score and ratio of female were significantly higher in NMOSD than in MS (<italic>p</italic>=0.037, <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c; 0.001, <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c; 0.001). No significant difference was noted between patients with NMOSD and MS for dimensions of HRQoL instruments, except for HRQOL related to physical disability (<italic>P</italic> =0.009~0.016) which was lower in NMOSD than in MS.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> This study indicated that physical disability, depression are the main factors influencing HRQoL in NMOSD.

Symptom clusters were identified through hierarchical cluster analysis, and the relationship between clusters and outcomes was assessed through regression modelling incorporating the clusters along with age, length of MS diagnosis, sex, race, household income, cigarette smoking, alcohol use, and comorbidities.

After removal of these items fit improved and an 18 items unidimensional scale emerged which satisfied Rasch model expectations (Chi-Square 99.7 (df 72); p=0.02; mean item fit residual -0.247; SD 1.39). Reliability (PSI) was high at 0.89 (alpha 0.92). No evidence of significant DIF was observed across all contextual factors.</p><p>The new scale correlated at 0.69 with the Herth Hope Index. A strong association between hopefulness and disease type was observed (Kruskall- Wallis p&#x0003c; 0.001) as with a subjective report of quality of life (Kruskall- Wallis p&#x0003c; 0.001). Thus those with progressive types of disease had a lower Hope Index, and those with higher self perceived quality of life reported a more hopeful disposition.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> A simple self-completed Hope Index for those with MS, built from the patient experience and satisfying Rasch measurement model standards, provides a disease-specific scale for this important mediating construct. The scale is free for use in all not-for-profit settings.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section625-1352458514547846"><title>P797</title><sec id="section626-1352458514547846"><title>Final results of the Swiss post marketing surveillance monitoring quality of life and treatment satisfaction in patients with RR-MS (SWISSASCENT)</title><p><underline>A Czaplinski</underline><sup>1</sup>, F Lieder<sup>2</sup>, P Stellmes<sup>3</sup>, S Ramseier<sup>4</sup>, L Achtnichts<sup>4</sup>, A Baumann<sup>5</sup>, O Kurlandchikov<sup>6</sup>, C Berger<sup>7</sup>, M Chofflon<sup>8</sup>, A Weidenfeller<sup>2</sup>, E Jaqui&#x000e9;ry<sup>2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Neurozentrum Bellevue, Zurich, Switzerland, <sup>2</sup>Novartis Pharma Schweiz AG, Rotkreuz, Switzerland, <sup>3</sup>Luzerner Kantonsspital, Lucerne, Switzerland, <sup>4</sup>Kantonsspital Aarau, Aarau, Switzerland, <sup>5</sup>Neurologie Oberaargau, Langenthal, Switzerland, <sup>6</sup>Neurologie am Roten Platz, St. Gallen, Switzerland, <sup>7</sup>Praxis f&#x000fc;r Neurologische Diagnostik &#x00026; Therapie, Sargans, Switzerland, <sup>8</sup>Clinique et Permance d&#x02019;Onex, Onex, Switzerland</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Treatment satisfaction and quality of life (QoL) are important disease management parameters in RR-MS. Fingolimod (Gilenya&#x000ae;), the first oral RR-MS treatment, is approved in Switzerland, since January 2011, to reduce frequency of relapses and delay disability progression.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> Provide real-world treatment satisfaction and QoL data for patients with RR-MS treated with fingolimod or other DMTs.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Patients with RR-MS considering a new DMT were interviewed at baseline (BL) and follow-up (FU, about 6 months after treatment initiation). Data collection was independent of treatment choice, did not require mandatory visits, and all assessments were done according to the Swiss label. Patients completed the MSIS-29 and TSQM-9 questionnaires to assess treatment satisfaction and QoL, respectively. 6h first dose monitoring (FDM) data were collected for fingolimod treated patients.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> 212 patients started treatment with fingolimod. 35% of patients were treatment-na&#x000ef;ve. In patients with previous DMT (65%), reasons for switching therapy were needle fatigue, intolerance, lack of efficacy, poor QoL and JCV antibodies. 91% of patients were free of abnormal ECG findings or adverse events during the FDM. 99.5% of patients continued fingolimod treatment after the FDM. At FU (mean 8.3 &#x000b1; 3.2 months after FDM), 96% of patients continued fingolimod treatment. All domains of the TSQM-9 (effectiveness, convenience, global satisfaction) showed significant improvement upon switching from other DMTs to fingolimod. The effectiveness and global satisfaction domains of TSQM-9 were comparable in both switch and in treatment-na&#x000ef;ve patients, suggestive of high satisfaction with fingolimod treatment in both types of patients. QoL (total MSIS-29 score) remained constant in both switch and treatment-na&#x000ef;ve patients during treatment with fingolimod, with a significant improvement of the mental subscore in patients switching from other DMTs to fingolimod. During FU, 12% of patients reported adverse events (all non-serious), including one patient (0.5%) with macular oedema. ARR decreased from 0.8 &#x000b1; 1.0 to 0.2 &#x000b1; 0.9.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> In this real-world setting, efficacy, tolerability and safety of fingolimod were in line with data reported in Phase 3 trials.

HRQoL was assessed at baseline, and 12, 24, and 48 weeks using 3 instruments: the Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale (MSIS-29), 12-item Short Form Survey (SF-12), and EuroQoL 5-dimensions questionnaire (EQ-5D). The impact of FLS and ISR on HRQoL was assessed in separate mixed-effects regression models, with random intercepts and slopes. All 3 treatment arms were pooled in the analyses, and indicators for occurrence of AEs (i.e. ISR and FLS) were used as time-dependent covariates. ISR was coded as an &#x0201c;ongoing&#x0201d; event at the time of a HRQoL assessment (yes vs. no, including those never experiencing any ISR) based on the start and end dates of the event and FLS was coded as an event occurring &#x0201c;&#x02264;7 days (vs. &#x0003e;7 days, including those never experiencing any FLS)&#x0201d; prior to an assessment, due to a very small number of ongoing events identified at the time of HRQoL assessment.

In 2005 we classified respondents as: No overactive bladder (No-OAB), Dry-OAB, Urinary Incontinence (UI-Any). Disability status was measured using the Patient Determined Disease Steps (PDDS). Progression was defined as a 1-point increase in PDDS during the five year follow-up period. We compared the groups using chi-square or Wilcoxon tests, as applicable. Multivariable analysis employed logistic regression or ANOVA models.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Of the 4870 eligible respondents, 24.6% reported No-OAB, 15.2% Dry-OAB, 60.2% with UI-Any. Of those with UI-Any: 50.8% reported slight UI, 30.6% moderate, 18.7% great. A higher proportion of Dry-OAB were male (34.1%) compared to No-OAB (21.9%), UI-Any (22.1%, p&#x0003c; 0.0001). UI-Any were older (52.9 years) compared to No-OAB (49.3), Dry-OAB (49.8, p&#x0003c; 0.0001); with no racial differences (94.1% Caucasian).

During the construction of the Neurological Fatigue Index for MS (NFI-MS), two sleep related scales were identified but it was concluded that further work was required for their development. There is currently no MS-specific scale for measuring sleepiness.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To develop patient reported outcome measures for sleep and sleepiness in MS by Rasch analysis.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> New sleep related scale items were based on themes and phrases derived from forty, semi structured interviews on MS fatigue. Candidate scale items were screened by an expert panel of neurologists with interest in sleep disorders, rehabilitation specialists and MS neurologists and therapists. A four point, Likert response option was used. A cognitive debrief of the new items was performed by 10 MS patients. Scale items reflected the qualities of sleepiness and rest in a non situation-specific way. A 42 item scale was then posted to patients with clinically definite MS of any age, gender, disability and disease type in two centres in the UK. The Epworth Sleepiness Scale was co-administered.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> 251 records were available for analysis (62.7%response). Exploratory factor analysis revealed 2 dominant factors and a further 2 minor factors. The factor groupings guided the Rasch analysis which allowed item reduction until two 9-item scales were generated with excellent fit to the Rasch model, and strict unidimensionality by post-hoc t-test. The scales were free from differential item functioning for a variety of important person factors. The first scale assessed diurnal sleepiness; it had moderate correlation (rho 0.6) with the Epworth Sleepiness Scale. The summed raw score cut point of 10 on the ESS was shown to equate to 17/27 in the diurnal sleepiness scale. The second scale measured the unrefreshing nature of nocturnal sleep.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> This new scale development corroborated previous findings that there are latent traits relating to diurnal sleepiness and quality of nocturnal sleep which are meaningful to patients with MS. The resultant scales were shown to fit the Rasch model and therefore measure unidimensional constructs and generate interval level data. The diurnal sleepiness scale does not contain situation-specific items and hence provides an alternative to the Epworth Sleepiness Scale.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section635-1352458514547846"><title>P802</title><sec id="section636-1352458514547846"><title>Defining clinical meaning of patient-reported outcomes with disability assessment in multiple sclerosis: an analysis of the CARE-MS II study</title><p><underline>L Steinman</underline><sup>1</sup>, H Wang<sup>2</sup>, Y Liu<sup>3</sup>, J Palmer<sup>4</sup>, Q Zhang<sup>2</sup>, on behalf of the CARE-MS II Investigators</p><p><sup>1</sup>Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, United States, <sup>2</sup>Sanofi R &#x00026; D, Bridgewater, NJ, United States, <sup>3</sup>TechData Service, King of Prussia, PA, United States, <sup>4</sup>Genzyme, a Sanofi Company, Cambridge, MA, United States</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Alemtuzumab is approved in over 30 countries for the treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). In the 2-year phase 3 CARE-MS II study, alemtuzumab demonstrated superior benefits in relapse rate, disability, and patient-reported outcomes (PROs) over subcutaneous interferon beta-1a (SC IFNB-1a) in RRMS patients who relapsed on prior therapy. PROs have been routinely evaluated in clinical trials of RRMS. However, the clinical implications of PROs in reference to disability improvement or progression need further clarification.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To evaluate the relationship between PROs and disability assessment in the CARE-MS II trial.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> In CARE-MS II (NCT00548405), patients were randomized to receive 2 annual courses of alemtuzumab 12 mg (n=426) or SC IFNB-1a 44 &#x000b5;g 3 times weekly (n=202). Yearly changes in 36-Item Short-Form Survey (SF-36) physical component summary (PCS) and mental component summary (MCS), and Functional Assessment of MS (FAMS) scores were analyzed against change in Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score. Mixed-effects model for repeated measures was used to adjust for age, gender, race, randomization arm, and baseline PROs and EDSS scores.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Mean age was 35 years at baseline, with 66% female and mean scores of 45 for PCS, 46 for MCS, 119 for FAMS, and 2.7 for EDSS. A 0.5-point worsening in baseline EDSS was associated with 1.0-point PCS worsening, 0.4-point MCS worsening, and 2.0-point FAMS worsening (all p&#x0003c; 0.001).

If a half-point EDSS difference is considered clinically meaningful, a 1-point change in SF-36 PCS and MCS or 3-point change in FAMS may represent a minimum important difference in PRO for patients with MS.

Studies of the relationship between physical disability and mental health in people with MS have reported mixed results, showing the need for further work. The relationship between the physical and psychological impacts of MS measured via the MSIS-29 has been documented and we have confirmed this in our cohort. However, the MSIS-29-PSYCH is not designed to distinguish between anxiety and depression.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> The aims of this study were to examine the impact of physical disability on anxiety and on depression in people with MS.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Between May 2011 and April 2012, 4516 people completed the MSIS-29 (v.1) and HADS scales via the UK MS Register within a 7 day time window. Chi squared and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to test for differences in anxiety and depression across categories of physical disability (low, moderate and high). Multiple regression was used to model the relationships between anxiety and physical disability, gender, age, disease course and disease duration; and similarly for depression.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The proportions of people experiencing anxiety or depression increased with physical disability such that 38.0% of respondents with low, and 66.7% with high disability reported at least mild anxiety, and 17.1% of people with low, and 71.7% with high disability experienced at least mild depression. The multiple regression model explained 18.4% of the variance in anxiety with MSIS-29-PHYS score being the strongest predictor of anxiety. The model for depression explained 37.8% of the variance with MSIS-29-PHYS score being the strongest predictor. Some of the other variables included showed negative associations with anxiety and depression, indicating that the influence of physical disability on mental wellbeing could be underestimated.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> This study indicates that there is a positive relationship between physical disability and anxiety and depression, that physical disability impacts on anxiety and depression to differing extents, and that the effects vary with gender, age, disease course and disease duration. We have shown that physical disability is a predictor of anxiety and depression, and that other factors may mask the extent of this effect. Whether the causes of anxiety and depression are reactive, organic or a combination, it is essential that mental wellbeing is given due attention in caring for people with MS so that all their health needs can be met.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section639-1352458514547846"><title>P804</title><sec id="section640-1352458514547846"><title>Relationship between relapses and quality of life in patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis</title><p><underline>L Grau-Lopez</underline><sup>1</sup>, M Tintor&#x000e9;<sup>2</sup>, L Rami&#x000f3;-Torrent&#x000e0;<sup>3</sup>, L Brieva<sup>4</sup>, A Saiz<sup>5</sup>, C Nos<sup>2</sup>, A Cano<sup>6</sup>, O Carmona<sup>3</sup>, JV Hervas<sup>7</sup>, X Montalban<sup>2</sup>, C Ramo-Tello<sup>7</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Hospital Universitari Germans Trias i P&#x000fb;jol, Neurosciences, Barcelona, Spain, <sup>2</sup>Hospital Vall Hebron, Neuroimmunology, Barcelona, Spain, <sup>3</sup>Hospital Universitari Josep Trueta, Neurology, Girona, Spain, <sup>4</sup>Hospital Universitari Arnau de Vilanova, Lleida, Spain, <sup>5</sup>Hospital Cl&#x000ed;nic i Provincial, Neurosciences, Barcelona, Spain, <sup>6</sup>Hospital de Matar&#x000f3;, Neurology, Matar&#x000f3;, Spain, <sup>7</sup>Hospital Universitari Germans Trias i Pujol, Neurosciences, Barcelona, Spain</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Relapses affect the patients&#x02019; psychological health and it would be useful evaluate their influence in quality of life.

CMI is typically documented based on performing a motor task alone (e.g., walking) and then whilst simultaneously performing a motor task and an attention demanding task (e.g., verbalising alternate letters of the alphabet). To date, researchers have not compared CMI in MS versus healthy controls sufficiently or examined the extent of CMI in both lower and upper limb tasks and across disability status.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> This study examined CMI in tasks involving the upper and lower limbs of persons with MS and compared the extent of CMI with healthy controls and across levels of neurological disability.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> The sample included 62 people with MS and 20 healthy controls. The persons with MS were stratified into groups of mild (n=20, EDSS 0-3.5), moderate (n=22, EDSS 4.0-5.5), and severe (n=20, EDSS 6.0-6.5) disability. All participants completed the 9-hole peg test (9HPT) without a cognitive task (single task; ST) and then while reciting alternate letters of the alphabet (dual task; DT). The same paradigm was completed while walking over an electronic gaitmat. The data were analysed using ANOVA and bivariate correlations.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The ANOVAs identified significant, large reductions in performance between the ST and DT trials for both walking (&#x003b7;<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup>=.411) and 9HPT (&#x003b7;<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup>= .384); there were no group (MS vs. controls) by task interactions for walking or 9HPT. Performance was decreased in the DT condition compared with ST as indicated by slower velocity (MS group= 12.5%, control group=17.5%) and longer time to complete the 9HPT (MS group= 36.2%, control group=33.2%). The degree of CMI for walking and 9HPT, based on DTC (100*((ST&#x02500;DT)/ST)), was correlated in the overall sample and in MS and control samples separately (all <italic>r&#x02019;s&#x0003e;</italic>0.5). The ANOVAs further identified significant, large reductions in performance between the ST and DT trials for both walking (&#x003b7;<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup>=.387) and 9HPT (&#x003b7;<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup>= .478) in the MS sample alone; there were no disability group by task interactions for walking or 9HPT.

Transcranial repetitive magnetic stimulation - rTMS at high frequency enhances corticospinal and plasticity, potentially favouring the effects of neurorehabilitation. The H-coil allows deeper magnetic fields compared with traditional stimulators, reducing the limit to stimulating lower limb representation, deeply located under the skull. In a preliminary study, we found that improvement in walking speed and endurance after intensive neurorehabilitation was significantly enhanced by the association with deep rTMS.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> We aimed at replicating the results of our pilot study and at combining results of both studies in order to explore correlations between clinical improvement and baseline neurophysiological features.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> We randomized 20 patients with progressive MS into real (n=10) and sham-placebo rTMS (n=10), who underwent 11 stimulation sessions (20 Hz, 90% resting motor threshold or 80% of maximal stimulator output in case of absent motor evoked responses at rest). Walking speed (10 meters test) and endurance (2 and 6 minutes Test) were assessed at baseline and at the end of treatment, as well as modified Ashworth Scale (MAS), visual analog scale-VAS for spasticity and pain, Fatigue Severity Scale, expanded disability score, MS walking scale-12, PASAT and nine hole peg test.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Compared with sham, real rTMS group had a significant improvement in 10MWT and Ashworth, confirming data from a previous pilot study on 21 patients. When pooling data with the latter study, a strong correlation between resting motor threshold and clinical improvement in walking tests was found exclusively in the real rTMS group.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Resting motor threshold results from the combination of corticospinal excitability and of the amount of corticomotor fibers available for conduction. While rTMS mainly acts on the former mechanism, both at the cortical and spinal level, the latter is a limiting factor in the presence of corticospinal damage, as in the case of progressive MS with lower limb motor involvement. In this condition, resting motor threshold could be considered an rTMS specific therapeutic reserve index, being predictive of therapeutic response to corticospinal neuromodulation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section650-1352458514547846"><title>P809</title><sec id="section651-1352458514547846"><title>Efficacy of mental imagery to improve autobiographical memory in multiple sclerosis patients: a double approach in neuropsychology and neuroimaging</title><p><underline>A Ernst</underline><sup>1</sup>, F Blanc<sup>2,3</sup>, D Gounot<sup>3</sup>, J De Seze<sup>2,4</sup>, L Manning<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>University of Strasbourg, Department of Psychiatry - Cognitive Neuropsychology and Physiopathology of Schizophrenia INSERM U 1114, Strasbourg, France, <sup>2</sup>University of Strasbourg, Department of Neurology, Strasbourg, France, <sup>3</sup>University of Strasbourg, ICube Laboratory - UMR 7357, Strasbourg, France, <sup>4</sup>University of Strasbourg, Byopathology of Myelin, Neuroprotection and Therapeutic Strategies INSERM U 1119, Strasbourg, France</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> We previously showed autobiographical memory (AM) impairment in non-depressed relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RR-MS) patients, very likely caused by a retrieval-strategy deficit.

Cerebral activation changes reflecting both an increase reliance on brain regions sustaining self-referential process and a decrease of those reflecting an effortful research process were displayed after the MVI program. While brain activity changes were also observed in the PG, they likely reflected an attempt to use the alternative sham strategy, but with no efficiency on AM functioning.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section652-1352458514547846"><title>P810</title><sec id="section653-1352458514547846"><title>Evaluation of gait abnormalities in MS patients with minimal disability</title><p><underline>K Novotna</underline><sup>1</sup>, L Sobisek<sup>2</sup>, L Sucha<sup>1</sup>, M Hoskovcova<sup>3</sup>, D Horakova<sup>1</sup>, E Havrdova<sup>1</sup>, J Lizrova<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>MS Center, Charles University in Prague, 1st Faculty of Medicine and General University Hospital in Prague, Department of Neurology and Center of Clinical Neuroscience, Prague, Czech Republic, <sup>2</sup>University of Economics, Department of Statistics and Probability, Prague, Czech Republic, <sup>3</sup>Charles University in Prague, 1st Faculty of Medicine and General University Hospital in Prague, Department of Neurology and Center of Clinical Neuroscience, Prague, Czech Republic</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Gait abnormalities are a common feature of the multiple sclerosis (MS) patients.

More than 50% of PwMS fall at least once a year and more than 90% suffer from instability during gait. Reliable and clinically feasible methods of gait instability assessment are needed. Clinical measures of balance and gait function should demonstrate sensitivity to pathology and remain invariable when there is no change in function. In order to address these two problems we present a novel testing procedure &#x0201c;the Narrow Path Walking Test (NPWT)&#x0201d; to evaluate balance function during gait.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> Investigating the repeatability (test-retest reliability) of NPWT parameters under single and dual task conditions for PwMS; Validating the NPWT with gold standard clinical examination of PwMS as well as exploring which of the NPWT parameters is associated with activity levels in PwMS.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Fifteen PwMS performed 3 trials of the NPWT under single task (ST) and 3 trials of dual task (DT). Participants were patients from the Sheba MS Center, at different activity levels ranging from 2 to 5.5 on the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS). Participants were instructed to walk within a 6-m narrow path normalized to pelvic width, without stepping out (i.e., step error). Trial time, number of steps, trial velocity, number of step errors, and number of cognitive task errors were determined. Concurrent validity was assessed using EDSS, Four Squares Step Test (FSST) and Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale (MSWS-12) using partial correlation controlled for age.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Test-retest agreement (ICC1,2) varied from 0.48 to 0.85 for ST and from 0.46 to 0.88 for DT, with no significant difference between the 2 trials except for trial velocity (t=2.364, p=0.033) were the 2<sup>nd</sup> trial was performed faster. Significant correlations were observed for trial time, velocity, and number of steps in ST and DT conditions with EDSS and MSWS-12 (0.60&#x0003c; r&#x0003c; 0.73). In addition number of step errors in the 2<sup>nd</sup> DT trial and average number of losing balance and falls in DT were significantly correlated with FSST (r=0.65, and r=0.76, respectively). Linear regression modeling sujest average trial velocity in DT predicts EDSS level (F=12.99,p=0.004); It is found in high correlation to EDSS (r=0.72) and the higher the EDSS level the slower the walking (b=&#x02212;0.16, &#x003b2;=&#x02212;0.72,t=&#x02212;3.60,p=0.004).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The present results indicate that the NPWT testing procedure is reliable, reproducible and associated with the EDSS scores.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section656-1352458514547846"><title>P812</title><sec id="section657-1352458514547846"><title>Visual delay adaptation to reduce intention tremor in multiple sclerosis</title><p><underline>M Heenan</underline><sup>1</sup>, R Scheidt<sup>1,2,3</sup>, S Beardsley<sup>1,4,5</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Marquette University, Biomedical Engineering, Milwaukee, WI, United States, <sup>2</sup>Northwestern University Feinburg School of Medicine, Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Chicago, IL, United States, <sup>3</sup>Medical College of Wisconsin, Neurology, Milwaukee, WI, United States, <sup>4</sup>Medical College of Wisconsin, Clinical and Translational Science Institute, Milwaukee, WI, United States, <sup>5</sup>Boston University, Biomedical Engineering, Boston, MA, United States</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Intention tremor is a disabling symptom affecting ~15% of those with multiple sclerosis (MS).

The resulting control model was simulated to determine the effects of varying actual and expected feedback delays, and results were used to choose experimental feedback delays. Subjects used the manipulandum to place a cursor on a target during a series of random step displacements. Cursor position was delayed from hand position by 100 (sets 1-2), 200 (set 3), or 300ms (set 4). Tremor was examined before and after the adaptation task using digital spiral tracing, handwriting, the Nine Hole Peg Test (9HPT), and a step-tracking task.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> For a subject with severe tremor (TAS=3), simulations of the best-fit neuromotor control model indicated that manipulation of an external visual delay could be used to alter the subject&#x02019;s expected delay. Average submovement interval, used to characterize expected delay, was 317&#x000b1;109ms pre-training and increased significantly to 460&#x000b1;143ms post-training (t(10) = 2.51, p = 0.01). This corresponded with a decrease in 9HPT times by 28% (RH) and 11% (LH). During spiral tracing, tremor frequency increased (3.2 to 4.3 Hz) while tremor power declined by 80%. For a subject with mild tremor (TAS=1), simulations indicated external feedback delays would be ineffective at shifting expected delay. Consistent with model predictions, submovement intervals did not increase following training (pre: 329&#x000b1;174ms, post: 340&#x000b1;180ms). Pre- versus post-training comparisons showed no change in 9HPT for either hand (&#x0003c; 5% decrease), while post-training tremor power increased by 183%.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Experimental characterization of subjects&#x02019; neuromotor control models predicted which subjects benefit from delay adaptation.

Even though nowadays sophisticated techniques are available to objectively evaluate the kinematic aspects of gait, the data they produced are scarcely suitable for clinical uses.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> We propose a novel characterization of gait kinematics in individuals with MS, based on a single measure (Gait Profile Score, GPS Baker et al., 2009) which is calculated on the basis of nine variables referred to pelvis, hip, knee and foot kinematics (Gait Variable Score, GVS) and obtained from a quantitative three-dimensional analysis of gait.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Forty-five patients suffering from relapsing-remitting MS (20 female, 25 male, mean age 46.7 years) with an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score in the range 1.5-7 participated to the study; they were classified in three groups: mild (EDSS 1.5-3), moderate (3.5-5-5) and severe (&#x0003e;6). All participants underwent a gait analysis from which the GPS index was calculated, and their results were compared with those of a control group (CG) of healthy age and gender-matched subjects. Differences in the GPS scores induced by the pathology were assessed using one-way MANOVA setting the status (healthy, mild, moderate and severe) as independent variable and the GPS and GVS as dependent variables.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> GPS value of healthy subjects was 5.99&#x000b0;, while individuals with MS reported 7.22&#x000b0;, 9.93&#x000b0; and 13.65&#x000b0; respectively for mild, moderate and severe status. MANOVA revealed a significant influence of status on gait kinematics [F(30,490.85) = 14.23, p &#x0003c; 0.001, Wilks &#x003bb;= 0.16, &#x003b7;<sup>2</sup> = 0.46]. Given the significance of the overall test, the univariate main effects were examined. Significant univariate main effects for status were obtained for GPS (p&#x0003c; 0.001) and eight out of nine GVS kinematic variables (p&#x0003c; 0.001). Significant pairwise differences were also obtained between all the status classes.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The differences in GPS between controls and individuals with MS at different stages suggest that such a measure is suitable for representing gait deviations from physiological patterns in MS. This index is thus potentially useful in monitoring the progression of the disease as well as providing ease in assessing the outcomes related to either pharmacologic or physical therapies.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section662-1352458514547846"><title>P815</title><sec id="section663-1352458514547846"><title>Factors affecting physical activity in minimally impaired people with multiple sclerosis</title><p>T Kahraman<sup>1</sup>, S Savci<sup>1</sup>, E Coskuner Poyraz<sup>1</sup>, <underline>S Ozakbas</underline><sup>2</sup>, E Idiman<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Dokuz Eylul University, Izmir, Turkey, <sup>2</sup>Dokuz Eylul University, Dept. of Neurology, Izmir, Turkey</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Despite the commonly known benefits of physical activity, evidence shows that people with multiple sclerosis (pwMS) are relatively inactive.

Physical activity was measured with Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire (GLTEQ) and an accelerometer which was used for the 7-day period. Demographic data such as age, gender, body mass index (BMI), and employment status were recorded.

Although associations were observed between stress and neurologic symptoms from MS, evidence regarding the effects of BFSM in individuals with MS is lacking.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To assess the effects of BFSM on self-reported symptom severity, neurologic performance tests, and blood markers of stress and inflammation, in patients with MS.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> This is a randomized controlled parallel group proof-of-concept trial of BFSM versus usual care (UC). Subjects in the BFSM group received 8 weekly sessions of relaxation training with heart rate variability biofeedback. Subjects in the UC group continued with routine MS care. Assessments were conducted at baseline and at end of training, including: self-report measures (MOS Short-Form-36 (SF-36), Patient Health Questionnaire-8 (PHQ-8), General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS)); a psychophysiological stress assessment (PPSA); MS-specific performance tests (MS Functional Composite (MSFC)); and blood testing for makers of stress and inflammation. BFSM subjects were further divided into &#x0201c;responders&#x0201d; (BFSM-R, n=5) or &#x0201c;non-responders&#x0201d; (BFSM-NR, n=5) based on their ability to regulate physiologic parameters. Between-group differences were tested using the Mann-Whitney U test, and Cohen&#x02019;s d was computed. Significance level was set for p&#x0003c; 0.1.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Nineteen subjects completed the study. At baseline, BFSM subjects (n=10) had a significantly shorter disease duration (8.5 (1-27) vs. 16 (8-31)years, p=0.028) and were less likely to take medications influencing cardiac function (20% vs. 78%, p=0.023) compared to UC subjects. There were statistically significant differences in change scores between BFSM-R and UC, favoring BFSM, on the PPSA (p&#x0003c; .01, d=&#x02212;2.15), GAD-7 (p=0.06, d=&#x02212;0.93), and MFIS (p=0.04, d=&#x02212;1.46). No significant differences were found between UC and BFSM-NR. Statistically significant differences were also noted between BFSM-R and BFSM-NR for CRP, GAD-7, and PHQ-8.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> These results suggest that BFSM is effective in promoting self-management of stress in individuals with MS, and in improving symptom severity in those who were successful in learning how to regulate physiologic parameters.

Continued loss of mobility and falls are among their greatest concerns for the future.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To determine if fear of falling is associated with spatial and temporal gait parameters in persons with MS, when measured by an instrumented treadmill.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> This study was an observational case control study. Sixty-eight relapsing-remitting patients diagnosed with MS, 38 women and 30 men, aged 40.9 (S.D=11.9), were recruited from the Multiple Sclerosis Center, Sheba Medical Center, Tel-Hashomer, Israel and participated in this investigation. Twenty-five apparently healthy subjects, 14 women and 11 men, aged 39.5 (S.D= 9.4) served as controls. Gait spatiotemporal parameters were obtained using the Zebris FDM-T Treadmill (Zebris&#x000ae; Medical GmbH, Germany). The Falls Efficacy Scale International (FES-I) was used to assess the level of concern relating to falls during 16 activities of daily living, ranging from basic to more demanding activities including social activities that may contribute to quality of life.</p><p>MS subjects were divided into two groups: highly fearful and slightly concerned about falling. Allocation was determined according to the FES-I scores. The cut-off point for distribution was set at a score of 20.

Twenty-seven patients were classified as slightly concerned about falling (mean FES-I=16.7, S.D=1.2). Highly fearful of falling patients walked slower had a shorter step length, a wider base of support and prolonged double support phase compared to slightly concerned patients. Fearful patients also demonstrated elevated variability of the center of pressure (CoP) trajectory compared to slightly concerned MS patients. The FES-I was significantly correlated with 17 (out of 17) gait spatiotemporal parameters. The strongest correlation was observed in terms of CoP lateral variability and double support period; 0.70, 0.65 (P&#x0003c; 0.001), respectively.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Fear of falling and spatiotemporal gait alterations in people with MS are linked. Additionally, variability of the CoP during walking appears to be connected with the level of concern.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section670-1352458514547846"><title>P819</title><sec id="section671-1352458514547846"><title>Brain activity during motor imagery in multiple sclerosis</title><p><underline>G Brichetto</underline><sup>1</sup>, A Tacchino<sup>1</sup>, R Teodorescu<sup>2</sup>, L Roccatagliata<sup>3</sup>, G Bommarito<sup>3</sup>, C Cordano<sup>3</sup>, GL Mancardi<sup>3</sup>, M Inglese<sup>2</sup>, MA Battaglia<sup>4</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Italian MS Foundation, Scientific Research Area, Genoa, Italy, <sup>2</sup>Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, NY, United States, <sup>3</sup>University of Genoa, Department of Neuroscience, Rehabilitation, Ophthalmology, Genetics, Maternal and Child Health, Genoa, Italy, <sup>4</sup>University of Siena, Department of Physiopathology, Experimental Medicine and Public Health, Siena, Italy</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Mental imagery (MI) is defined as mental execution without any actual movement and involves neural networks overlapped with those activated during actual actions. Although widely investigated in stroke, very little is known about MI in Multiple Sclerosis (MS). In a recent study we showed a MI impairment in relapsing-remitting (RR) course compared to healthy controls (CTRL).</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> We propose to investigate the neural correlates of MI impairment in MS patients using fMRI and behavioral tasks and to assess whether MI deficit is associated with disease severity.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> We recruited 24 right-handed subjects, 8 RR (32.6&#x000b1;6.4 yrs; EDSS:1.5, 1-3.5), 8 clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) patients (31.88&#x000b1;6.10 yrs; EDSS:1, 0-1.5), 8 CTRL (29.6&#x000b1;3.4 yrs) undergoing MRI (1.5T GE scanner) with the following sequences: a) T2-W spin-echo; b) 3D-T1-W FSPGR; c) EPI for fMRI. Two tasks were performed during fMRI acquisition: (1) motor execution (ME) with subjects squeezing a ball with the dominant/non-dominant hand; (2) MI with subjects imagining to squeeze the ball with the dominant/non-dominant hand. The same tasks were performed before the MRI scan to record ball squeezes executed/imagined ratio (R) evaluating anisochrony in dominant and non-dominant hand.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> RR and CIS showed an increased R compared to CTRL: RR=1.76&#x000b1;0.69; CIS=1.41&#x000b1;0.17; CTRL=1.17&#x000b1;0.12. Regarding fMRI, ME showed a gradient of increased activity in MS (RR&#x0003e;CIS) than CTRL; intra-group comparison between MI and ME showed decreased activation in MI compared to ME in all the groups. Compared to CTRL, CIS patients were not significantly different in brain activation during MI, whereas RR patients showed increased activation with the non-dominant hand in the Thalamus bilaterally, R Precentral, R Fusiform gyrus, R Cingulum and L Inferior Parietal Lobule. Compared to CIS, RR patients showed increased activation with dominant hand in the L Postcentral, R Thalamus and L SMA and with non-dominant hand in R Pre- and Postcentral, R and L IPL, L Cingulum. No significant association was found between areas of brain activations and T2-LV in patients.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Brain activity during MI is higher in RR than in CTRL and CIS and that is associated with increasing asynchrony on the behavioral task. Interestingly, the strongest association is found with increased activity of L Cingulum connecting sites implicated in cognitive control. This pilot study is aimed to better clarify MI in MS to possibly identify new rehabilitation strategies towards a better QoL.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section672-1352458514547846"><title>P820</title><sec id="section673-1352458514547846"><title>Neuropsychological and neurophysiological assessment of a cognitive rehabilitation program for multiple sclerosis patients</title><p><underline>M Vazquez-Marrufo</underline><sup>1</sup>, A Galvao-Carmona<sup>1</sup>, M Borges<sup>2</sup>, JL Ruiz-Pe&#x000f1;a<sup>2</sup>, G Izquierdo<sup>2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>University of Seville, Seville, Spain, <sup>2</sup>Multiple Sclerosis Unit, Seville, Spain</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Cognitive impairment is common in multiple sclerosis patients.

All groups were matched for socio-demographic (age, genre, education level and handedness) and clinical (EDSS and duration of disease) variables. A cognitive rehabilitation program was applied to the treatment group in 60 sessions over three months. The rehabilitation program was a modified version of Attention Program Training (APT). Behavioral responses, latency and topography of the ERP component (P3) were calculated before and after the rehabilitation program was delivered.

No changes were found in the healthy and pathological control groups. No change in P3 latency was found in any group. Regarding the topography, there was a high correlation (r=0.91, p&#x0003c; 0.05) in the treatment group between the beginning and the end of the program; when the healthy and pathological groups were compared (Pathological Control and Treatment), lower correlations for the P3 maps were obtained (r=0.41 and r=0.71, respectively, p&#x0003c; 0.05).There were no statistical differences in the neuropsychological scores.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> There was a better reaction time performance without a neuropsychological improvement. P3 latency was also blinded to the benefit, but the topography of this component reflected different patterns of brain activity between the pathological and healthy groups.

Core power was assessed by maximum number of &#x02018;sit-ups&#x02019; and maximum number of modified &#x02018;push-ups&#x02019;. The number of successful repetitions in 30 second was recorded. Balance and functional mobility was assessed with the duration of single-limb stance and Timed &#x0201c;up and go&#x0201d; test (TUG) respectively. Spearman correlations were used to determine relationships between core stability, balance and functional mobility.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Core endurance was significantly correlated with duration of single-limb stance (r= 0.490-0.615, p&#x0003c; 0.05) and TUG (r= &#x02212;0.405_-0.643. p&#x0003c; 0.05) in patients with MS. Core power was significantly correlated with duration of single-limb stance (r= 0.440-0.726, p&#x0003c; 0.05) and TUG (r=&#x02212;0.371_-0.649, p&#x0003c; 0.05) in patients with MS.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Core stability was related to balance and functional mobility. These results indicate that balance training should include core stability exercises in patients with MS.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section680-1352458514547846"><title>P824</title><sec id="section681-1352458514547846"><title>The state of MS: current insight into patient-neurologist relationships, barriers to communication and treatment satisfaction</title><p><underline>M Tintore</underline><sup>1</sup>, M Duddy<sup>2</sup>, DE Jones<sup>3</sup>, N Law<sup>4</sup>, G O&#x02019;Neill<sup>5</sup>, A Uccelli<sup>6</sup>, R Weissert<sup>7</sup>, S Wray<sup>8</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>MS Centre of Catalonia, Hospital Vall d&#x02019;Hebron, Barcelona, Spain, <sup>2</sup>Royal Victoria Infirmary, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, United Kingdom, <sup>3</sup>University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, United States, <sup>4</sup>National MS Society, Denver, CO, United States, <sup>5</sup>Biogen Idec, Cambridge, MA, United States, <sup>6</sup>University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy, <sup>7</sup>University of Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany, <sup>8</sup>Hope Neurology MS Center, Knoxville, TN, United States</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> The chronic, progressive, and variable nature of multiple sclerosis (MS) underscores the importance of establishing strong relationships between patients and their health care providers (HCPs), to promote effective communication and ensure high treatment satisfaction.

To make informed decisions about this treatment, patients need to understand quantitative information about its benefits and risks, which requires statistical numeracy. It is unknown, however, whether MS affects numeracy and how MS patients score in comparison to the general population.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To compare numeracy between NAT treated MS patients and a probabilistic national sample; to identify variables that predict patients&#x02019; numeracy.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Since 12/2011 the prospective, observational, multicenter study PERCEPT investigates NAT patients&#x02019; and neurologists&#x02019; benefit/risk perception and knowledge in routine practice in Germany. Numeracy of NAT patients was assessed as the proportion of correct answers on a standard test (1). So far, complete data from 211 patients were available (data collection ongoing) and were compared to published data on numeracy in a German probabilistic sample with N = 1,001 (1) with an analysis of variance controlling for age, sex, and education. Within patients, a multiple regression assessed which demographic variables (age, sex, education) and which MS variables (years with MS, disability, annual relapse rate) allowed predicting numeracy.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Preliminary analyses showed that MS patients had slightly higher numeracy than the probabilistic national sample (72.8% vs. 69.0% correct answers, p =.048). Within patients, numeracy was predicted by education (beta = .26, p = .0002), years with MS (beta = .17, p = .033) and sex (beta = .15, p = .026), but not by age, disability, and annual relapse rate. The overall predictability of numeracy was low (R square = .112, p = .0005).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> In these preliminary analyses, MS patients had slightly higher numeracy than a national probabilistic sample, controlled for age, sex, and education. One should therefore not assume that MS patients understand quantitative health information worse than the general population. Other variables typically known about patients (education, years with MS, sex) predicted their numeracy, but predictability was so low that using those variables in practice to judge who will understand quantitative health information cannot be recommended.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section686-1352458514547846"><title>P827</title><sec id="section687-1352458514547846"><title>Analysis of data from an adult day program for people with multiple sclerosis</title><p><underline>D Burke</underline><sup>1</sup>, S Minden<sup>1</sup>, M Serotkin<sup>2</sup>, H Machado<sup>1</sup>, G Wideman-Hughes<sup>2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Brigham and Women&#x02019;s Hospital, Psychiatry, Chestnut Hill, MA, United States, <sup>2</sup>The Boston Home, Dorchester, MA, United States</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> B.

B.

Fit! to determine whether participation in the program results in improvements in mental functioning, quality of life, and perceptions of social support, and to determine which program components are most effective.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> We surveyed participants at four points throughout the year to analyze changes in quality of life and mental and social functioning. We also investigated whether the length of time in the program and frequency of attendance contributed to better outcomes. In combination with satisfaction surveys, we interviewed participants to determine which activities they preferred and found most beneficial.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Preliminary data show that B. Fit! participants&#x02019; mean Mental Health Inventory (MHI-5) score is comparable to that of another sample of MS patients in the US, and have a higher, (less distressed) mean MHI-5 score than patients with subthreshold depressive symptoms, major depression, and dysthymia, and people over the age of 65 with a disability. Modified Social Support Survey (MSSS) scores, which measure perceived social support, indicate that B. Fit! participants, when compared to patients with other chronic illnesses, felt that they had greater support in terms of material aid and assistance, but not in terms of the availability of people with which to share fun activities, provide affection, or emotional information. Mean MCS (Mental Composite Scores) of the SF-12 indicate that participants have a higher level of mental quality of life than the general MS and depressed population.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Results from the MHI-5 scores suggest that the psychological distress among B. Fit! participants is similar to that among the MS population in general, and that it is greater than among people with other chronic illnesses, although not as severe as among people with a mental illness or older populations with a physical disability. Future analyses will examine the relationship between psychological distress and perceived lack of social support and the impact of attending B.Fit! on both.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section688-1352458514547846"><title>P828</title><sec id="section689-1352458514547846"><title>A prospective study comparing the impact of three levels of support services on interferon &#x003b2; adherence in patients with relapsing MS: interim results</title><p><underline>BA Cohen</underline><sup>1</sup>, A Perrin Ross<sup>2</sup>, B Hayward<sup>3</sup>, A Hassan<sup>3</sup>, F Dangond<sup>3</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Davee Department of Neurology, Chicago, IL, United States, <sup>2</sup>Loyola University Chicago, Maywood, IL, United States, <sup>3</sup>EMD Serono, Inc., Rockland, MA, United States</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Suboptimal adherence to disease-modifying treatments (DMTs) is common in MS.

Group A is randomized to a standard MSLL services group (who receive phone calls and nurse visits at set intervals) or a custom services group (who have the option of selecting which &#x02018;standard&#x02019; services they receive, and who also receive educational materials, planning tools and reminders). Patients in more remote areas are allocated to Group B and receive phone calls and a visit for injection training. The primary endpoint is the difference in medication adherence, derived from the cumulative number of missed injections (as reported by patients every 4 weeks), between the standard and custom service groups.

Importantly, there is significant atrophy of this structure among persons with MS, and the volume of the hippocampus has been inversely associated with performance on tests of memory encoding. There is substantial evidence that aerobic fitness and exercise training yield improvements in hippocampal volume among older adults without MS, and one recent case study suggested similar benefits in MS. There is a need for additional evidence of an association between aerobic fitness and hippocampal volume before investing considerable time, effort, and resources into clinical trials of aerobic exercise training in MS.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> This study examined the association between aerobic fitness and hippocampal volume in persons with MS.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> We enrolled 25 persons with MS (EDSS = 1.0-6.5) who underwent an incremental exercise test on an electrically-braked, Lode cycle ergometer for objectively quantifying aerobic fitness as peak power output (W<sub>p</sub>).

Using 3D T1-weighted MR images, volumes of the right and left hippocampi were automatically calculated by the FMRIB&#x02019;s Integrated Registration and Segmentation Tool (FIRST)-algorithm FMRIB&#x02019;s Software Library (FSL). We examined the association using Spearman rho bivariate (<italic>r<sub>s</sub></italic>) and partial (<italic>pr<sub>s</sub></italic>) correlations controlling for age and EDSS scores.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> W<sub>p</sub> was significantly associated with the average hippocampal volume (<italic>r<sub>s</sub></italic>=.41) and EDSS scores (<italic>r<sub>s</sub></italic>=&#x02212;.77), but not age (<italic>r<sub>s</sub></italic>=&#x02212;.31). The correlations were not statistically significant between hippocampal volume with age (<italic>r<sub>s</sub></italic>=&#x02212;.15) or EDSS scores (<italic>r<sub>s</sub></italic>=&#x02212;.12).

Several valuable parameters can be obtained from exercise testing: VO<sub>2max</sub>; peak value at exercise tolerance (VO<sub>2peak</sub>); and oxygen consumption over time. The latter indicates capacity of the body to economically respond to exercise demand.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> The purpose of this study was to identify variability in response to exercise in people with MS.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> By pooling three studies assessing exercise capacity in people with MS, the largest data set on oxygen consumption during exercise has been compiled. A total of 169 people (mean age 44; 72% women; majority RRMS) were tested using maximal graded cycling protocol. Group based trajectory analysis was used to identify patterns of oxygen uptake over time.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Ten distinct trajectories of exercise response were uncovered. The most striking source of variation was time to exercise termination which was &#x0003c; 8 minutes for 30 people (18%), between 8 and 15 minutes for 79 people (47%), and up to 27 minutes for the remaining 60 (35%). Peak oxygen consumption averaged 24 ml/kg/min (SD:9). Using normative data, 114 people (67%) had values &#x0003c; 15%ile and only 14 people (8%) had values &#x0003e;50%ile. The slope for change of oxygen uptake for the least energy economical group was 2.45 ml/kg/min/min, and their time to termination was short, compared with 0.47 for the most energy economical group, with a longer time to termination. These two extreme groups showed a ratio of slopes of 5.2.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The poor exercise tolerance in this relatively young and able population confirms previous findings.

Over the last decade substantial research efforts have examined predictors, consequences and strategies to prevent falls in IwMS. A major limitation of this research is that it has almost exclusively focused on individuals capable of walking.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To reach consensus on an operational definition of non-ambulatory IwMS and determine the prevalence of falls in this segment of the MS population.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> An international expert panel was convened to determine a consensus- based operational definition of non-ambulatory IwMS. The definition was subsequently applied to data from a population-based study of falls in IwMS living in Stockholm (Ytterberg et al, 2013, J Rehabil Med 45:452-7) to determine the proportion of non-ambulatory IwMS and fall prevalence rate. In that study, performance and self-reported mobility data and self-reported data on falls in the last 3 months was collected from 164 IwMS ranging in age from 19-79 years old.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The expert panel determined that &#x0201c;non-ambulatory&#x0201d; was best operationalized with performance-based measures as opposed to self-report measures. Inability to perform a timed walk test was identified as the best outcome to operationalize &#x0201c;non-ambulatory&#x0201d;. Using these criteria, 39 of the 164 participants (24%) were identified as non-ambulatory. Of these 39 individuals, 11 reported falling at least once in the past 3 months (28%). Preliminary results showed that fall risk factors in non-ambulatory and ambulatory IwMS differed.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> This novel research project yielded a useful operational definition of non-ambulatory IwMS. Nearly a quarter of the population-based sample was found to be non-ambulatory. The high prevalence of falls in this population highlights the need to better understand risk factors and consequences of falls among non-ambulatory IwMS. The International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health could be used as a comprehensive framework to guide this research agenda. This work represents the initial phase of the development of a complex intervention specifically designed to reduce falls among non-ambulatory IwMS.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section696-1352458514547846"><title>P832</title><sec id="section697-1352458514547846"><title>Low-cost portable posturography for patients with multiple sclerosis using Wii balance board</title><p><underline>L Prosperini</underline><sup>1</sup>, L Stocchi<sup>2</sup>, M Patrignani<sup>2</sup>, L Castelli<sup>3</sup>, G Sellitto<sup>3</sup>, C Pozzilli<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Sapienza University, Neurology and Psychiatry, Rome, Italy, <sup>2</sup>RomaTre University, Dept. of Computer Sciences and Automation, Rome, Italy, <sup>3</sup>S.

The displacement (mm) of body&#x02019;s center of pressure (COP) under eyes opened and closed was estimated using a &#x0201c;gold-standard&#x0201d; laboratory-grade force platform (ProKin PK254P, Tecnobody) and the commercial WBBS.

Postural sway has been validated as a predisposing factor to falls in MS. Serum Vitamin D (VitD) levels has been shown as a variable associated with postural sway in elderly. VitD supplementation reduces sway and falls in elderly fallers but effects in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) are not established</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To evaluate the relationship between sway and VitD serum levels in a group of MS patients in a cross-sectional designed study.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> A group of MS patients attending the University MS Center of Cagliari during the winter of 2012 were included. Balance was assessed by postural sway analysis using a force platform. The patients were asked to stand barefoot as motionless as possible for 30 seconds on the plate keeping a stable and relaxed position with and without visual control. During the same period the patients were tested for VitD serum levels by RIA (Diasorin). Center of Pressure (COP) time series were post-processed to calculate the sway area, COP path length, COP displacements and velocity in the medio-lateral and antero-posterior directions. Correlation between all these sway parameters and VitD were tested by means of the Pearson product moment correlation analysis first without adjusting for confounding variables and then adjusting for age and EDSS.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> 49 MS patients 13 male and 36 female were enrolled. Mean age was 40.4 (DS&#x000b1;14.5) and mean EDSS was 2.8(DS&#x000b1;1.9) while median values of VitD serum levels were 14.4 (DS&#x000b1;16.9). None of the sway parameters considered for the eyes open and eyes closed test showed significant relationship with VitD serum levels also after adjusting for confounding factors.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The most common explanation to VitD effect on postural response in elderly is the direct action on muscle strength. In fact VitD receptors in muscles lead to protein synthesis and cell growth while supplementation in deficient individual improve muscle strength. Nevertheless the mechanisms of postural impairment in MS is more complex and involves a wide number of structures in the CNS where the effects of VitD, although questioned, basing to our data are limited.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section702-1352458514547846"><title>P835</title><sec id="section703-1352458514547846"><title>An exploratory study of the acceptability and efficacy of working memory training for individuals with pediatric-onset multiple sclerosis</title><p><underline>B Kuni</underline><sup>1</sup>, A Sye<sup>2</sup>, EA Yeh<sup>2,3,4</sup>, C Till<sup>1,4</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>York University, Department of Psychology, Toronto, ON, Canada, <sup>2</sup>Hospital for Sick Children, Division of Neurology, Toronto, ON, Canada, <sup>3</sup>University of Toronto, School of Medicine, Toronto, ON, Canada, <sup>4</sup>Hospital for Sick Children, Research Institute, Neurosciences and Mental Health, Toronto, ON, Canada</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Cognitive impairment occurs in 30-50% of children and adolescents with Multiple Sclerosis (MS), with prominent deficits in working memory (WM).

Nevertheless relationship between gait and cognition has been studied only using gait spatial-temporal (ST) parameters but not Kinematic analysis, which could give more insight on ambulation impairment.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between kinematic gait alterations and cognitive processing speed, verbal and visual memory (evaluated by means of the Symbol digit modality test (SDMT), the Selective reminding test (SRT, Amato et al.2006) and the Brief visuospatial memory test revised (BVMT-R Benedict R et al 1997)).</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> A group of patients attending the MS Center of Cagliari were enrolled. The inclusion criteria were a diagnosis of MS, the ability to walk independently without any assisting device for at least 20 meters and the absence of other pathologies that could affect gait.</p><p>An MS expert neurologist performed a Neurostatus evaluation and the cognitive tests. Kinematic and ST parameters were acquired using an optoelectronic system. The Gait Profile Score (GPS, Baker et al., 2009) was used as a synthetic index for the kinetics data.

All participant were familiar with Nintendo Wii + Balance Board system. They played three games of the Wii-Fit suite namely Penguin Slide (PS), Table Tilt (TT) and Balance Bubble (BB). During the session, Center of Pressure (COP) time series were collected using a force platform placed under the Balance Board. Raw data were post-processed to calculate the COP displacements and velocity in mediolateral (ML) and anteroposterior (AP) directions. The statistical analysis was performed by means of a three-way MANOVA setting as independent variables the subject&#x02019;s status (MS or HC) direction (AP and ML) and played game (PS, BB and TT), while the dependent variables were COP displacements and velocities.

In particular, ANOVA revealed that COP displacements and velocities were found larger in ML direction with respect to AP (p&#x0003c; 0.001) for both groups, while no significant differences between HC and MS were found for any of the COP parameters. Different games induced different amplitude of both ML and AP displacements, while velocities in AP direction appear no influenced by the played game. On the contrary, PS was the game associated with the largest COP velocities in ML (p&#x0003c; 0.001 when compared to TT and BB)</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The Wii-Fit games in MS induced an unbalanced activity in sagittal and frontal planes. The prevalence of ML movements is not related to MS features but is rather an intrinsic feature of the games. Our data gave more insight on the postural mechanisms during a Wii games session, nevertheless further studies are needed to understand whether a long-term unbalanced activity might influence the postural sway and thus a more accurate choose of Wii games must be considered.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="section708-1352458514547846"><title>Reproductive aspects and pregnancy</title><sec id="section709-1352458514547846"><title>P838</title><sec id="section710-1352458514547846"><title>Glatiramer acetate and pregnancy in women with multiple sclerosis - results from the German multiple sclerosis and pregnancy registry</title><p><underline>S Herbstritt</underline><sup>1,2</sup>, M Rockhoff<sup>1</sup>, N Ebrahimi<sup>3,4</sup>, G Koren<sup>3,4</sup>, R Gold<sup>1</sup>, K Hellwig<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Department of Neurology, St. Josef Hospital, Ruhr University, Bochum, Germany, <sup>2</sup>Institute of Clinical Pharmacy and Pharmacotherapy, Heinrich Heine University, Duesseldorf, Germany, <sup>3</sup>Motherisk Division of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, ON, Canada, <sup>4</sup>University of Toronto, Leslie Dan Faculty of Pharmacy, Toronto, ON, Canada</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> MS is the most common autoimmune disease of the central nervous system, which mainly affects young women of reproductive age.</p><p>Only limited data are available on whether GLAT exposure during pregnancy has an effect on perinatal outcome.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To determine safety of glatiramer acetate (GLAT) exposure during pregnancy of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS).</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> We compared the outcome of pregnancies of patients with MS exposed to GLAT with pregnancies of disease-matched unexposed controls and healthy women.</p><p>Women with MS were enrolled into the German MS and pregnancy registry at any point during pregnancy.

Label guidelines recommend contraception for women of childbearing potential for &#x02265;4 months after treatment.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To report pregnancy outcomes in alemtuzumab-treated patients in the clinical development program and serious adverse events (SAEs) in their fetuses/infants.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> In 36-month, phase 2 CAMMS223 (NCT00050778) and 24-month, phase 3 CARE-MS I (NCT00530348) and CARE-MS II (NCT00548405) core studies, RRMS patients received alemtuzumab intravenously 12 or 24 mg/day (only 12 mg in CARE-MS I) on 5 consecutive days at baseline and on 3 consecutive days 12 months (and 24 months in CAMMS223 subgroup) later, or SC IFNB-1a 44 &#x000b5;g 3 times weekly. Follow-up continued in an extension (NCT00930553) with as-needed alemtuzumab re-treatment (first-time treatment for former SC IFNB-1a patients). Contraception was required, but pregnancies did occur. Patients becoming pregnant could remain on study with alemtuzumab suspended. Information on pregnancy outcomes and SAEs in fetuses/infants was collected.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> As of October 17, 2013 (N=1486), 139 pregnancies occurred in 104 patients, resulting in 67 live births, 14 elective abortions, 24 spontaneous abortions, 1 stillbirth, 4 unknown outcomes, and 29 ongoing. Most pregnancies (133/139) occurred &#x0003e;4 months after last alemtuzumab dose. Spontaneous abortion rate was age-related (overall: 17% of pregnancies; &#x0003c; 35 y: 12%; &#x02265;35 y: 32%). SAEs occurred in 12 fetuses/infants; each SAE was a unique event type. Grade 4 thyrotoxic crisis occurred in a 21-day-old, full-term infant whose mother developed Basedow&#x02019;s disease during pregnancy; infant recovered after treatment with iodine, methylprednisolone, and propylthiouracil. Two elective abortions followed fetal defect SAEs (hypoplastic left heart syndrome/cystic hygroma and anembryonic gestation).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Spontaneous abortion risk in alemtuzumab-treated patients was comparable to that in the general population. No trends emerged in types of fetus/infant SAEs. Women of childbearing potential should continue contraception for 4 months after alemtuzumab.

Exposure to natalizumab was defined as suspension of the drug &#x0003c; three months prior to conception. Pregnancy outcomes and clinical relapses during pregnancy were compared with data from the Italian pregnancy dataset (Amato et al. 2008). Data on pregnancy outcomes for the Italian population were also available. All the patients were administered a structured interview which gathered detailed information on pregnancy course and outcomes, as well as on possible confounders. Group comparisons were assessed through the chi<sup>2</sup> test or the analysis of variance with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons, when appropriate.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> So far 28 pregnancies were recruited. Pregnancies resulted in 20 live births, six spontaneous abortions and two voluntary abortions (one due to Down Syndrome). Proportion of spontaneous abortion in NE pregnancies (21.4%) was higher than that previously observed in interferon-beta exposed (IFNBE) pregnancies (8%; p=0.015), although it fell within the upper limit of that expected in the general population. Proportion of pre-term deliveries (29.4%), mean birth-weight (2904gr) and birth-length (48.9cm) were comparable to those of IFNBE pregnancies. The occurrence of relapses during the NE pregnancies (25%) was higher than that observed in the IFNBE patients (13.3%; p=0.01).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our findings do not show any major safety issues due to pregnancy exposure to natalizumab in terms of spontaneous abortion and other outcomes.

This is not necessarily explained by infertility; rather, it could be caused by a reduced propensity to maternity due to a number of reasons including concerns about disability and postponement of maternity while on immunomodulatory drugs. MS may also affect the delivery procedure, with a higher number of planned caesarean deliveries (CD) in MS women, and breast-feeding, since women may choose not to breastfeed so they can resume their preventive therapies.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To assess whether: 1) there is a higher frequency of childlessness in MS women and to examine its possible causes, 2) there is a higher proportion of CD and 3) the frequency of breast-feeding is reduced in MS women.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Female MS patients aged &#x0003e;43 years attending seven MS Centers in Emilia-Romagna, Italy, and control subjects (CS) aged &#x0003e;45 years enrolled at the Breast Cancer Screening Center of Modena, were asked to fill-out a self-administered anonymous questionnaire exploring pregnancy issues.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Of 219 patients and 201 CS, fifty MS women (23%) were childless, compared to 21 controls (10%) (p=0.0007). The lack of a stable relationship was more frequent in the MS cohort (43; 19% vs 25; 12%) (p=0.048), though after correction for relationship status and thyroid dysfunction, MS diagnosis still determined two-fold higher odds of childlessness (OR: 2.4; p=0.005). We found similar rates of miscarriage in MS (46; 26%) compared to CS (39; 23%) but a higher rate of elective abortions (EA) (36; 21% vs 19; 11%) (p=0.01). There were no significant differences in the proportion of pregnancies achieved by assisted reproductive technology (4; 2.5% vs 2: 1,1%). The main reported reasons for childlessness were similar in MS patients and CS: &#x0201c;no stable relationship&#x0201d; (37% vs 38%), followed by &#x0201c;no desire to have children (27% vs 28%) and &#x0201c;infertility&#x0201d; (16% vs 14%). CDs were more frequent in MS (46; 29% vs 34; 17%) (p=0.0229) while there were no differences in the percentage of women who did not breast-feed (41; 24% vs 33; 18%).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> MS is associated with higher frequencies of childlessness, elective abortions and CD while it does not affect the frequency of breast-feeding. Our results indicate that childlessness in MS may in part be due to the lack of a stable relationship and to higher rates of elective abortion rather than to infertility issues.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section723-1352458514547846"><title>P845</title><sec id="section724-1352458514547846"><title>Sex life of women with multiple sclerosis: qualitative study</title><p>SD Y&#x00131;lmaz<sup>1</sup>, <underline>H Gumus</underline><sup>2</sup>, OF Odabas<sup>2</sup>, HE Akkurt<sup>3</sup>, H Yilmaz<sup>3</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Faculty of Health Sciences, Selcuk University, Midwifery, Konya, Turkey, <sup>2</sup>Konya Education and Research Hospital, Neurology, Konya, Turkey, <sup>3</sup>Konya Education and Research Hospital, Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation, Konya, Turkey</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Spasticity, tremor, muscle weakness, sensorial disorders, depression, cognitive problems, bladder and bowel dysfunction and sexual dysfunction are commonly seen in multiple sclerosis (MS) and these conditions significantly affect the quality of life of patients. Sexual functioning of a woman is a complex process affected by psychological, physiological and personal factors. Sexual function of a woman is affected by diseases and disabilities, reduces the quality of life and may affect the family relations as well.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To define the thoughts, emotions, experiences and perceptions of women with MS and to determine how women are affected physically and emotionally by MS, the study was performed using qualitative research methods.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> In the study performed via in-depth interviews, a semi-structured questionnaire was used. 24 women aged &#x02265; 18 years were invited to the study, and 3 of them were excluded as they stated that they don&#x02019;t want to talk about their sex life. An approval was obtained from the Ethical Board of the Faculty of Health Sciences, Selcuk University. All participants were informed about the fact that the interview would be taped, transcribed, and their names would be kept confidential before collecting data.Transcribed interviews were qualitatively and thematically analysed using content data analysis to code and categorize emerging themes.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Three main topics were established. The first one was &#x0201c;uncertainty&#x0201d;. Women had one of the following complaints: numbness in hand and feet, loss of sensation, balance or visual problems. Women were worried about the effects of MS on physical health and degree of disease progression. Their psychological state was negatively affected by this condition. The second topic was &#x0201c;changes in sex life&#x0201d;. Particularly, lack of sexual desire, lack of sexual stimulation due to insensitivity, unable to reach orgasm and decreased sexual satisfaction were noted. In addition, two women stated that they experience urinary incontinence during the intercourse. The third topic was &#x0201c;feeling of inadequacy&#x0201d;. Feeling of uselessness was dominant amongst women due to problems with married life and their role as a woman.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Women may experience physical and emotional challenges affecting sexual life negatively after MS, but cannot discuss their problems frankly with healthcare providers. So, healthcare providers should evaluate MS patients meticulously as to sexual life and direct such patients to appropriate health centres.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section725-1352458514547846"><title>P846</title><sec id="section726-1352458514547846"><title>Pregnancy outcomes for female patients and partners of male patients in the teriflunomide clinical development program</title><p><underline>B Kieseier</underline><sup>1</sup>, M Benamor<sup>2</sup>, P Truffinet<sup>2</sup>, L Jung Henson<sup>3</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Heinrich-Heine University, D&#x000fc;sseldorf, Germany, <sup>2</sup>Genzyme, a Sanofi Company, Chilly-Mazarin, France, <sup>3</sup>Swedish Medical Center, Issaquah, WA, United States</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Teriflunomide is a once-daily oral immunomodulator approved for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS). Evidence from animal studies suggests a potential risk of teratogenicity associated with teriflunomide. During the teriflunomide clinical studies, pregnancy was therefore excluded before starting treatment, and use of reliable contraception was required for women of childbearing potential and men with partners of childbearing potential.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To summarize pregnancy outcomes for female patients and partners of male patients enrolled in the phase 2 and 3 studies in the teriflunomide clinical development program.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Patients received teriflunomide 14 mg or 7 mg, interferon beta, or placebo. Despite the requirement for use of reliable contraception, pregnancies were reported. Upon learning of pregnancy, female patients were instructed to discontinue treatment and undergo an accelerated elimination procedure. Pregnancy outcome information was collected using a Drug Exposure Via Parent form (data cut-off Oct 2013).</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 83 pregnancies in female patients were reported in the teriflunomide clinical trial program; of these, 70 occurred in women treated with teriflunomide. There were 26 live births in female teriflunomide-treated patients, and all newborns were healthy, with no structural or functional abnormalities. The known rate of spontaneous abortion in teriflunomide-treated female patients was within the range reported for women without MS; median birth weight and gestational age at birth for newborns of teriflunomide-treated female patients were within the ranges reported for newborns born to mothers without MS.</p><p>An additional 22 pregnancies were reported in the partners of male patients, 19 of which occurred in partners of male patients treated with teriflunomide.

This is consistent with findings from the pregnancy registry and extensive post-marketing studies of patients treated with leflunomide. Pregnancy outcomes among female patients who received teriflunomide and partners of teriflunomide-treated male patients were consistent with those in the non-MS population.

However, the ovarian reserve, a measure of the fertility potential, has not been systematically studied in MS patients followed in clinical practice conditions.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> The aim of our cross-sectional study was to evaluate the ovarian reserve and the integrity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis in a Spanish cohort of fertile women with MS under usual disease modifying treatment (DMT) and to compare with a group of healthy volunteers.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> 25 female MS patients and 25 age-matched healthy controls were included in the study. In their early follicular phase of menstruation (2<sup>nd</sup>-5<sup>th</sup>day) each participant underwent to a transvaginal ultrasound to evaluate ovarian volume and antral follicle count (AFC) and the same day, a determination of sex hormones and antim&#x000fc;llerian hormone (AMH) levels. Patients were excluded if they had a history of being treated with gonadotoxic treatments and/or had a history of any known endocrine disease or infertility (e.g., polycystic ovary syndrome). MS patients were free from steroid treatment at least for 3 months.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Oral contraception consumption was similar between patients and volunteers (28% vs 24%, p=0.747). MS patients showed significantly higher concentrations of prolactin, total and free testosterone and a significantly lower serum concentration of 17-&#x003b2;-estradiol. MS patients exhibited higher levels of inhibine A and lower levels of inhibine B. Mean ovarian volume, total AFC and AMH did not show significant differences between both groups. In patients, an annualized relapse rate (ARR) &#x0003e; 0.5 was significantly associated with lower levels of AMH, mean ovarian volume and total AFC. Patients under treatment with high dose of interferon beta (IFN&#x003b2;) had a lower mean ovarian volume and reduced levels of estrogens than those treated with low dose or other DMT, but with similar levels of AMH.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> MS patients in their childbearing age do not have compromised ovarian reserve but they exhibit hormonal alterations usually associated with impaired fertility: higher levels of prolactin and androgens with reduced levels of estrogens. If the clinical activity of the disease and/or the use of high-dose IFN&#x003b2; influence the ovarian reserve deserves to be studied in a large cohort.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section731-1352458514547846"><title>P849</title><sec id="section732-1352458514547846"><title>Sexual dysfunction and incidence of depression in MS patients</title><p>V Ba&#x00161;i&#x00107; Kes<sup>1</sup>, <underline>I Zavoreo</underline><sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>UHC Sestre Milosrdnice, Neurology, Zagreb, Croatia</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Multiple sclerosis (MS) is one of the most frequent diseases of the central nervous system and usually occurs at the age when people would be expected to be in the prime of their sexual lives.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> In everyday practice sexual dysfunction is underestimated because clinicians mostly concentrate on the classical neurological deficits and often overlook symptoms that can seriously affect the quality of life.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> We included in our study 97 patients with relapse remitting multiple sclerosis from our MS register, 22 men and 75 women with established diagnosis of relapse remitting multiple sclerosis according to McDonald criteria.

Previous studies suggested that some interventions can minimize the impact of DS. It is important to consider, however, that despite the high prevalence of sexual dysfunction in MS, we should not neglect other conditions that may also be causing difficulties concerning sexuality such as hypertension, diabetes, continence problems, psychiatric disorders and effect of drugs.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> This study confirms the need to approach the sexuality theme in MS patients for treatment. The use of a standardized tool may facilitate the initial approach and introduce it naturally in clinical practice.

Mean age at symptom onset was 34 and 74% had relapsing remitting MS. Respondents were similar in all characteristics (p&#x0003e;0.2) to all survey recipients (n=1301), except for age (48.6 vs 46.3, p&#x0003c; 0.001).</p><p>From the women born in the 1940s through women born in the 1980s, age at menarche (12.7), ever-use of hormonal contraceptives (HC, 86%), mean age of first birth (24) and total number of births (2.1) remained stable over time. The rates of women limiting their pregnancy due to infertility and lack of desire to have children remained stable, but a trend of increasing concerns regarding teratogenicity of disease modifying therapy (DMT) was noted in later decades. Declining use of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) was also noted over time, with less use of HRT in postmenopausal women born in the 1960s compared with those born in the 1940s (38% vs 59%, p=0.06); only 3.1% vs. 31.2% reported HRT use within 3 years of menopause, p=0.028.</p><p>Women diagnosed with MS earlier in life (ages 15-25) on average breastfed fewer months per birth compared to those diagnosed at a later age (e.g. ages 45 - 55, 1.8 &#x000b1; 0.6 months vs 5.6 &#x000b1; 0.8 months respectively, p=0.045).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> In this large survey we identified some reproductive practices in women with MS that appeared stable over the past few decades, such as parity and HC use. However, we also noted emerging patient-reported concerns regarding teratogenic effects of DMTs, as well as declining rates of HRT and breastfeeding duration, that may reflect wider social changes as well as evolving clinical practices in MS and women&#x02019;s health. Further study is required to confirm these findings in clinical cohorts and assess interactions between reproductive practices and disease course.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section737-1352458514547846"><title>P852</title><sec id="section738-1352458514547846"><title>The role of breastfeeding in multiple sclerosis patients</title><p><underline>S Perez-Sanchez</underline><sup>1</sup>, S Eichau-Madue&#x000f1;o<sup>1</sup>, M Rus-Hidalgo<sup>1</sup>, G Navarro-Mascarell<sup>1</sup>, G Izquierdo<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Virgen Macarena University Hospital, Neurology, Multiple Sclerosis Unit, Sevilla, Spain</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Multiple sclerosis (MS) is more common in women of child-bearing age. Pregnancy and breastfeeding (BF) must be planned carefully because although disease activity decreases during the pregnancy, there is a higher risk of relapse after delivery. Traditionally, breastfeeding was not recommended, but this lately become a controversial point.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> Our aim is to know the course of the disease in MS patients depending on the type of feeding.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> We observed all pregnancies in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) women at Virgen Macarena University Hospital from 2004 to 2014, and interviewed them by phone call about pregnancy and feeding after delivery. We divided them in two groups to compare: breastfeeding (BG) vs non breastfeeding (NBG). The collected data included age at pregnancy, EDSS, duration of the disease, previous treatment and time to restart treatment after the delivery, relapse before, during the pregnancy and feeding and after the feeding. We also collect time to progresi&#x000f3;n of the disease (more than 1 point in the EDSS).</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> We identified 130 pregnancies in that period but only 79 completed the interview. Mean age at pregnancy was 31.52 years-old. 67.1% of our patients chose breastfeeding instead of artificial feeding. Results also showed that patients who chose breastfeeding were those with a lower relapse rate. Patients who chose artificial feeding restarted their treatment following the delivery with a mean wait period of 4.96 days. The mean length of follow up was 4.89 years. Baselines, pregnancy and feeding characteristics showed no statistically significant differences between the two groups (p&#x0003e;0.05), except for the time to restart treatment (p=0.03). We also found no differences between groups regarding EDSS, duration of disease, the annualized rate of relapses before or during pregnancy and feeding and time to progression (p&#x0003e;0.05).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The role of breastfeeding in RRMS patients is controversial because of the higher risk of relapse after delivery. Our study shows that the patients with lower rates of relapse were those who choose natural breastfeeding. The patients with higher relapse rates were those who chose artificial feeding and restarted the treatment sooner. Despite this, however, all patients presented the same course of disease regardless of the type of feeding. For this reason, we think that breastfeeding could play a protective role, at least, in patients with low relapse rates.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section739-1352458514547846"><title>P853</title><sec id="section740-1352458514547846"><title>Examining the effectiveness of pregnancy counseling in women with multiple sclerosis of childbearing potential</title><p><underline>LH Travis</underline><sup>1</sup>, K Clarke<sup>1</sup>, NC Hank<sup>2</sup>, LR Mckinney<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Phoenix Neurological Associates, LTD, Phoenix, AZ, United States, <sup>2</sup>Neurovitality, Chandler, AZ, United States</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> MS is twice as prevalent in females as males and typically has an onset between the ages of 18-45 which is commonly known to be of child bearing age. Unplanned pregnancies account for half of all pregnancies in the United States and can pose potential risks. Women typically are advised to discontinue interferon-beta therapy before trying to conceive; however, if a neurologist does not counsel or discuss such issues with a MS patient of childbearing potential, unplanned pregnancy can occur and risks related to exposure, although remain unclear, still can occur for the women and her child. By proactively counseling and discussing issues with such patients from the start of their diagnosis, can not only prevent unplanned pregnancies but will also lessen risks. Through proper counseling, physician/patient relations can be enhanced as well as increase the MS patient&#x02019;s knowledge of pregnancy risks and options.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To demonstrate the effectiveness of counseling and discussion of pregnancy risks during clinic visits through planned vs unplanned pregnancy outcomes.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Over thirty female MS patients of child bearing potential (18-45) who have been a patient of record at Phoenix Neurological Associates over the last two years were identified and a retrospective chart review was performed to determine which patients received counseling, how often and what the incidence of planned, unplanned or no pregnancy outcomes were.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Retrospectively reported planned pregnancy rates and no pregnancy rates were higher than unplanned pregnancy in patients who were counseled continuously throughout the course of DMT treatment.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Early data suggests that proper, consistent pregnancy counseling can lower the risk of unplanned pregnancy.

But still, sexuality is a taboo for patients as well as doctors. Especially regarding women there is a lack of data on sexual functioning.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> The aim of the study was to evaluate the frequency and characteristics of sexual dysfunctions in female MS patients with relapsing-remitting MS compared to otherwise healthy female headache patients.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Consecutive female patients of the outpatient MS clinic and of the outpatient Headache clinic were invited to participate in the study. Sexual functioning was evaluated by the Multiple Sclerosis Intimacy and Sexuality Questionnaire (MSISQ-19; adapted for headache patients), a self-rating questionnaire. It divides sexual dysfunctions in primary, secondary, and tertiary sexual dysfunctions, i.e. affection of genitals and sexual sensations by MS, impairments caused by MS affecting sexuality indirectly, and impact of MS on psychosocial and emotional aspects of sexuality, respectively. We evaluated depression (Beck Depression Inventory) and quality of life by the Short-form-36 questionnaire (SF-36).</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> We screened 82 patients, 42 MS patients (34.7 &#x000b1; 6.7 years, median EDSS 1.8) and 31 patients with primary headaches (32 &#x000b1; 8.7 years) were included. Of the 42 MS patients 35.7 % had any form of sexual dysfunction, with primary sexual dysfunction being the most common form (40 %), and 33.3 % having tertiary sexual dysfunction. Of the 31 headache patients 22.6 % had any form of sexual dysfunction, with primary and tertiary sexual dysfunctions being the most common forms. The frequency of sexual dysfunctions did not differ significantly between MS and headache patients, but headache patients more often had a combination of primary, secondary and tertiary sexual dysfunction. Depression and the psychological and physical scale of the SF-36 correlated significantly with sexual dysfunction in both groups.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> A considerable number of females with MS suffers from sexual dysfunctions. This is associated with depressive symptoms and reduced quality of life. Doctors should pay attention to this and integrate it into the therapeutic approach.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section743-1352458514547846"><title>P855</title><sec id="section744-1352458514547846"><title>Fecundity in women with multiple sclerosis: an observational retrospective mono-centric study</title><p><underline>T Roux</underline><sup>1</sup>, R Debs<sup>2</sup>, C Lubetzki<sup>2</sup>, P Touraine<sup>3</sup>, C Courtillot<sup>3</sup>, C Papeix<sup>2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>APHP, Hopital Piti&#x000e9; Salp&#x000ea;tri&#x000e8;re, Paris, France, <sup>2</sup>APHP, Hopital Piti&#x000e9; Salp&#x000ea;tri&#x000e8;re, Neurology, Paris, France, <sup>3</sup>APHP, Hopital Piti&#x000e9; Salp&#x000ea;tri&#x000e8;re, Endocrinology and Reproduction, Paris, France</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a frequent neurological disease mostly affecting women of childbearing age. Many questions arise when counseling MS patients on the effects of MS on pregnancy and vice-versa. Reassurance can often be given regarding contraception, pregnancy management, pregnancy outcome and the risk of the child developing MS. However, evidence lacks concerning impact of MS and disease modifying treatment (DMT) on the time to pregnancy. A better knowledge of these could drive advice and therapeutic strategy during time to conception.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> The aim of this study is to assess time to pregnancy, in a French cohort of MS women.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> This observational retrospective study, included consecutively 115 women with Multiple Sclerosis (Polman et al 2011) admitted in the Piti&#x000e9;-Salp&#x000ea;tri&#x000e8;re MS clinic between December 2013 and January 2014. Information was given before inclusion and self-questionnaires were completed during the daily-hospitalization.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Among the 115 female patients included : mean age was 45.39 years [21 to 78], 56.5% had a relapsing remitting form, 34.8% a secondary progressive form, and 8.7% a primary progressive form. Mean disease duration was 11.97 years [1 to 37]. Mean EDSS score at inclusion was 4.18 [0 to 7] and average MSS score was 5.05 [0.24 to 9.08]. Self-questionnaires showed that 95 women had a parental project whereas 20 women (17.4% of the group) have chosen to stay childless, by choice or by recommendation of their neurologist. Among the 95 women with a parental project, 11 have never been spontaneously pregnant. The average time to spontaneous pregnancy reported for 124 out of 216 pregnancies (92 time to pregnancies reported &#x0201c;not known&#x0201d;) was 8.57 months (SD = 18.22) when pregnancy occurred before MS onset, and 7.53 months (SD = 10.45) after MS onset (p=0.69).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> This study reveals that time to pregnancy is similar before and after MS onset, and not different from the French general population. According to the time to spontaneous pregnancy, it seems reasonable to maintain IFN and GA until conception (and even during pregnancy). Safety of others DMT remains partially unknown and need to be further evaluated.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section745-1352458514547846"><title>P856</title><sec id="section746-1352458514547846"><title>Progestin content of oral contraceptives and the risk of multiple sclerosis</title><p><underline>AM Langer-Gould</underline><sup>1</sup>, K Hellwig<sup>2</sup>, LH Chen<sup>1</sup>, C Schroeder<sup>1</sup>, F Stancyzk<sup>3</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Kaiser Permanente Southern California, Research &#x00026; Evaluation, Pasadena, CA, United States, <sup>2</sup>Ruhr-University Bochum, Neurological Clinic, Borchum, Germany, <sup>3</sup>University of Southern California, Obstetrics &#x00026; Gynecology and Preventive Medicine, Los Angeles, CA, United States</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> The types of progestins used in oral contraceptives have different biological effects on androgen, gluco-and mineral corticoid receptors and vary in their anti-and pro-estrogenic effects. In addition, higher doses of estrogen may have differential effects.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To determine whether the risk of MS varies by the type of progestin or amount of ethinyl estradiol contained in combined oral contraceptives (COC).</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> We conducted a population-based nested case-control study for the membership of Kaiser Permanente Southern California (KPSC). We identified females ages 14-48 years with incident MS or clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) between 2008 and 2011. Ten controls per case were matched on age, race/ethnicity and membership characteristics. Oral contraceptive use up to ten years prior to symptom onset/index date was obtained from the complete electronic health record. Data were analyzed using conditional logistic regression adjusted for age, smoking, obesity, live births and abortions.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> We identified 400 women with incident MS/CIS and 3992 matched controls. The most common form of hormonal contraceptive was COCs used by 40% of cases and 31.9% of controls. The majority (70.6%) of women who took COCs, used more than one type. The most common progestins in COCs were norethindrone and levonorgestrel . Most COCs used contained between 0.03 and 0.049mg of ethinyl estradiol. Ever having used any COC in the 10 years prior to symptom onset was associated with an increased risk of MS/CIS (OR 1.44, 95%CI 1.14-1.82, p=0.002). This increased risk was found regardless of the type of progestin or estrogen dose used most recently prior to symptom onset/index date.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> We did not detect a difference in the association between OC use and MS/CIS based on the progestin content or estrogen dose in this contemporary cohort. This may be due to the relatively large number of multiple progestin-type users and the restricted range of estrogen content (i.e. few high or low dose users). Larger studies and meta-analyses with more variation in types of COCs used are needed to confirm these findings.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="section747-1352458514547846"><title>Risk management for disease therapies</title><sec id="section748-1352458514547846"><title>P857</title><sec id="section749-1352458514547846"><title>Maraviroc and JC - virus associated immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome</title><p><underline>L Zhovtis Ryerson</underline><sup>1</sup>, I Kister<sup>1</sup>, J Herbert<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>NYU Langone Medical Center, Neurology - Multiple Sclerosis Comprehensive Care Center, New York, NY, United States</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> In patients with Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy secondary to Natalizumab (PML-NZB) immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) has been regarded as nearly universal. Currently there are no evidence-based treatments for IRIS. Glucocorticoids are commonly used, but this may inhibit JC virus clearance and worsen underlying PML. Chemokine receptor 5-positive (CCR5+) T cells have been indirectly implicated in IRIS pathophysiology. Maraviroc, a CCR5 antagonist approved for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, may blunt IRIS in PML-NTZ. To our knowledge, there is only a single published case report of effective use of Maraviroc in this clinical setting.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To report on two cases of Maraviroc-treated disseminated PML-NTZ from NYU MS Center in which no clinically or radiologically significant IRIS was observed over 3-15 months of follow up.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Case series.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The first patient is 49 year old woman with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) on NZB for 3 years and 6months who presented for a second opinion with 3 months of worsening numbness, ataxia, and dysarthria. Brain MRI suggested wide -spread PML and spinal fluid analysis confirmed the diagnosis, with 390 JCV copies/mL detected (Focus Diagnostics). Maraviroc 300mg twice a day was initiated after plasmapheresis (PLEX). Patient remained free of clinically significantl IRIS. Patient&#x02019;s clinical status and MRI stabilized over 6 month and Maraviroc was tapered. Patient was discharged home in stable condition; her EDSS is 6.5. Second patient is 47 year old woman with RRMS on NZB for 6 years and 9 months who developed progressive right lower extremity weakness. Brain MRI revealed a new T2 lesion in the left motor cortex and spinal fluid analysis confirmed the diagnosis, with 18 JCV copies/mL detected (NIH laboratory). Maraviroc was initiated after PLEX. No significant radiological or clinical IRIS has yet to be seen.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Development of IRIS is considered near universal in PML-NZB, yet we did not observe it in our two Maraviroc treated patients. Furthermore, the drug was well tolerated by our patients and has been shown to have good safety profile. We advocate for a clinical trial of this drug in NZB - associated PML. However, until a clinical trial can be organized, it is important to increase the body of literature that documents clinicians&#x02019; experience with the use of Maraviroc to treat the JC virus - associated IRIS.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section750-1352458514547846"><title>P858</title><sec id="section751-1352458514547846"><title>Fifteen non-fatal outcomes in natalizumab-associated PML/IRIS: the effects of early diagnosis and evolving novel therapeutic approaches</title><p><underline>D Stefoski</underline><sup>1</sup>, R Balabanov<sup>1</sup>, M Ko<sup>1</sup>, J Strong<sup>1</sup>, C Hernandez<sup>1</sup>, C Muth<sup>1</sup>, M Mercurio<sup>1</sup>, A Javed<sup>2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Rush University Medical Center, Multiple Sclerosis Center and Department of Neurological Sciences, Chicago, IL, United States, <sup>2</sup>University of Chicago, Department of Neurology, Chicago, IL, United States</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> An often disabling or fatal opportunistic brain infection caused by the John Cunningham virus (JCV), progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) occurs in immunecompromised states, including treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS) with natalizumab.</p><p>We treated fifteen patients with MS, five from Rush and ten community-referred, with PML occurring after 14-70 months of natalizumab treatments.

The initial variably added plasma exchange, oral mefloquin, mirtazapine, and maraviroc evolved as inessential. Anticonvulsants and unaggressive corticoids are administered at the onset of PML and IRIS, respectively.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> There were no fatalities. MRI discovered asymptomatic PML in 4 patients. Three patients had initially negative CSF JCV qPCR. Six of 15 recovered to baseline and 2 with residual deficits to high functioning. The remaining 7 patients&#x02019; outcomes were significantly worse than pre-PML.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our multipronged protocol consisting of early PML detection followed by empirical management probably prevented fatal outcomes, even in patients with delayed diagnosis. Early and frequent MRIs and administration of filgrastim likely contributed to favorable resolution of PML/IRIS in 8 of 15 patients. This approach warrants further exploration.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section752-1352458514547846"><title>P859</title><sec id="section753-1352458514547846"><title>Managing the switch from natalizumab: the washout is hazardous and should be avoided</title><p><underline>F Rinaldi</underline><sup>1</sup>, P Perini<sup>1</sup>, D Seppi<sup>1</sup>, S Miante<sup>1</sup>, P Gallo<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>University Hospital of Padova, Padova, Italy</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Natalizumab-treated relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) patients may face a high risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). Actually, in RRMS patients treated for more then 24 months and having a JCV-antibody index &#x0003e;1.5, the risk of PML is about 1:125. Thus, natalizumab discontinuation is highly suggested in these patients and a washout period of three months is generally adopted before starting a new second line therapy. However, MS reactivation has been observed, especially after 3<bold>-</bold>4 months after the last dose of natalizumab, raising concern that the washout may expose patients to severe relapses.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To evaluate, in a large cohort of MS patients, the risk and timing of disease reactivation after natalizumab discontinuation.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> In the period March 2011-September 2013, natalizumab was stopped in 66 RRMS patients. Reasons for discontinuation were: pregnancy in 6 patients, high PML risk in 60. Fifty-eight patients were switched to other therapies after a three month-washout period: 50 switched to fingolimod, 6 to interferon beta (IFNb), 2 to cyclophosphamide. Two patients remained therapy free. All the patients were followed for at least six months with monthly clinical examination and brain MRI performed before starting the new therapy and in case of relapse.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Between month 4 and 6 after natalizumab break, clinical and/or neuroimaging evidence of disease reactivation was observed in 100% IFNb-treated, 44% (22/50) fingolimod-treated and 100% cyclophosphamide-treated patients. Of the 6 females that planned pregnancy, 3 had a mild disease reactivation between months 4 and 5, while three remained disease free. Both untreated patients relapsed. All together, 35/66 (53%) patients had disease reactivation.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our observations strongly confirm that, independently from the subsequent therapeutic options, a three month-washout after natalizumab is hazardous since it exposes the patients to a &#x0003e;50% risk of disease reactivation between month 4 and 6. Thus, any washout, especially in patients having had very active disease prior to natalizumab, should be kept to a minimum or even avoided. Worth of interest are the six patients that decided to plan the pregnancy: three patients remained disease-free and three had mild relapses, than all remained asymptomatic throughout the pregnancy, confirming the protective effect of pregnancy even in patients with particularly active MS.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section754-1352458514547846"><title>P860</title><sec id="section755-1352458514547846"><title>MS FIRST - a longitudinal, prospective, comparative drug safety module for use in MS clinical practice</title><p><underline>J Haartsen</underline><sup>1</sup>, T Spelman<sup>2</sup>, L Morgan<sup>2</sup>, S Agland<sup>3</sup>, J Baker<sup>4</sup>, M Canty<sup>5</sup>, L Rath<sup>6</sup>, J Lechner-Scott<sup>3</sup>, H Butzkueven<sup>4,7</sup>, MS FIRST Study Group/MSBase</p><p><sup>1</sup>Eastern Health, Melbourne, Australia, <sup>2</sup>MSBase Foundation Royal Melbourne Hospital, Melbourne, Australia, <sup>3</sup>John Hunter Hospital, Newcastle, Australia, <sup>4</sup>Royal Melbourne Hospital, Melbourne, Australia, <sup>5</sup>Westmead Hospital, New South Wales, Australia, <sup>6</sup>Alfred Health, Melbourne, Australia, <sup>7</sup>Eastern Health, Box Hill, Australia</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> The comparative long term safety profile of disease-modifying therapy (DMT) in MS treatment is unknown. Although adverse events such as infection risk and liver function test (LFT) abnormalities are known possible side effects, incidence and trends over time in serious adverse events (SAEs) are less well characterised in real world clinical practice. MS FIRST, a sub-study of the MSBase registry, is an Australian multi-centre study to implement a user-friendly safety module to track safety outcomes in MS patients over the long term.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> The primary objective of this study is to track and compare the incidence of safety outcomes in MS patients who either receive DMT (including fingolimod according to approved label) or who are on no treatment. The secondary objective is to characterize the longitudinal distribution of lymphocyte count and LFT abnormalities in fingolimod treated patients.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Data from the module was extracted on 10 April 2014. Patients contributing a baseline and at least 1 post-baseline follow-up visit were included in the descriptive analyses (years of follow-up; frequency of event counts).</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> As at the date of data compilation, MS FIRST had enrolled 1704 patients (3462 clinic visits, cumulative 802.7 person-years of follow-up) since enrolment on 1 Jan 2012. Mean (SD) follow-up was 5.7 (6.7) months. Of the 904 patients who contributed at least 1 post-baseline visit, 703 (77.8%) has been exposed to DMT during follow-up. Of these, 462 (65.7%) had exposure to fingolimod. Across the observation period 14 infective SAEs, 14 Herpes Zoster events, 2 malignancies (excluding non melanoma skin cancer, NMSC) and 5 NMSC were recorded on fingolimod, compared with 9 infection SAE&#x02019;s, 8 Herpes Zoster, 4 malignancies and 7 NMSC on any other DMT. 575 patients on fingolimod contributed 2300 lymphocyte counts and LFT&#x02019;s. Of these, 21 (3.7%) recorded at least one lymphocyte count &#x0003c; 0.2 whilst no patients recorded a count &#x0003c; 0.1. 74 (12.9%) patients recorded a gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) level &#x0003e; x5 the upper limit of normal (ULN) at least once on fingolimod.</p><p>7 (1.2%) recorded an alanine transaminase (ALT) level &#x0003e;5x ULN.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The establishment of a large, prospective multi-drug safety module for use in routine practice has been successful to date in Australia.

In controlled clinical studies, the overall infection rate with fingolimod 0.5 mg was similar to that with placebo. In the post-marketing setting (PMS) in 2013, a fatal case of a varicella-zoster virus (VZV) infection was reported with fingolimod 0.5 mg.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To report the rate and severity of VZV infections with fingolimod 0.5 mg in clinical studies and in PMS.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> In the analyzed clinical trials, rates of adverse events (per 1000 patient-years, PY) are based on pooled data from the completed controlled phase 2 and three phase 3 studies (FREEDOMS, FREEDOMS II and TRANSFORMS) and their long-term extensions. In PMS, we evaluated the cumulative reporting rate every six months since 2010. We also report data on VZV reactivation (herpes zoster, HZ) by severity and clinical complication.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> As of 28 Feb 2014, more than 91,500 patients received fingolimod in clinical trials and the PMS with at least 135,800 PY of exposure. Data from controlled clinical trials showed that the rates of VZV infections were 11 with fingolimod 0.5 mg vs. 6/1000 PY with placebo, and were unchanged in the extension (up to 7 years) phases. In the controlled phases of clinical trials, uncomplicated cutaneous HZ constituted 95% of all cases (10.4/1000 PY with fingolimod 0.5 mg); no cases of disseminated HZ were reported with 0.5 mg. In PMS, the cumulative reporting rate of VZV infections was 7.2/1000 PY and the rates have remained consistent. The overall reporting rate of complicated HZ is estimated at about 0.3/1000 PY. Based on analysis from the FDA adverse event reporting system database, the proportion of serious HZ infections on fingolimod is comparable to other MS DMTs. Non-cutaneous manifestations were uncommon. Only a few cases of recurrent, non-serious dermatomal HZ cases have been reported to date.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Rates of VZV infections in fingolimod clinical trials were low with fingolimod 0.5 mg, but higher than in placebo recipients. VZV infection rates remained stable over time in extension studies and PMS. These cases were mostly uncomplicated cutaneous HZ. The risk of VZV infections is well manageable with appropriate vigilance for signs/symptoms of infections and with clear recommendations on immunization against varicella.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section760-1352458514547846"><title>P863</title><sec id="section761-1352458514547846"><title>Treatment of multiple sclerosis patients after 24 Natalizumab doses: a prospective observational study: the TY-STOP</title><p><underline>M Clerico</underline><sup>1</sup>, I Schiavetti<sup>2</sup>, SF De Mercanti<sup>1</sup>, F Piazza<sup>1</sup>, D Gned<sup>1</sup>, V Brescia Morra<sup>3</sup>, R Lanzillo<sup>3</sup>, A Ghezzi<sup>4</sup>, A Bianchi<sup>4</sup>, G Salemi<sup>5</sup>, S Realmuto<sup>5</sup>, P Sola<sup>6</sup>, F Vitetta<sup>4</sup>, P Cavalla<sup>7</sup>, G Superti<sup>7</sup>, D Ferraro<sup>6</sup>, D Paolicelli<sup>8</sup>, M Trojano<sup>8</sup>, MP Sormani<sup>2</sup>, L Durelli<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>University of Torino, Orbassano, Italy, <sup>2</sup>Biostatistics Unit Department of Health Sciences (DISSAL), Genoa, Italy, <sup>3</sup>University of Naples, Naples, Italy, <sup>4</sup>MS Center, Sant&#x02019; Antonio Abate Hospital, Department of Neurology, Gallarate, Italy, <sup>5</sup>University of Palermo, Palermo, Italy, <sup>6</sup>University of Modena, Modena, Italy, <sup>7</sup>MS Center, AOU Citt&#x000e0; della Salute e della Scienza, Torino, Italy, <sup>8</sup>University of Bari, Bari, Italy</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Natalizumab is the most effective drug for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RR-MS) but could rarely be associated with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), whose risk increases after 24 natalizumab administrations.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To evaluate the efficacy of different available therapies, on mean annualized relapse rate (ARR) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) activity after 24 natalizumab doses, in patients with RR-MS.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Spontaneous, prospective, multicenter, observational,1-year study to evaluate disease course 24 doses of natalizumab.

The relapse risk was estimated through a Poisson regression model adjusted for the following covariates: sex, age, first drug after NTZ, reason for discontinuation, comorbidity, previous DMDs/immunosuppressant (IS) exposure, disease duration, EDSS, number of infusions, relapses (yes/no) during NTZ and in the year before NTZ. Patients who started, after NTZ, a treatment with fingolimod (FIN) or with other DMDs were propensity score (PS)-matched on a 1-to-1 basis at the switching date, and the relapse risk was estimated by a Poisson model.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> At least one clinical relapse after stopping NTZ was experienced by 264/613 (43.07%) patients. During the follow-up (17&#x000b1;14.09 months), 441 (71.9%) patients received at least 1 DMDs prescription after a mean wash-out time of 4.66&#x000b1;6.26 months, whereas 172 (28.1%) were not treated at all. The Poisson regression analysis demonstrated that a higher number of relapses in the year before and during NTZ treatment was correlated to the risk of relapses (IRR=1.59, p=0.0001 and IRR=1.39, p=0.002, respectively) after NTZ discontinuation. During the follow-up, patients not treated at all resulted at higher relapse risk in comparison to patients receiving FIN (IRR=4.38, p&#x0003c; 0.0001) or other DMDs (IRR=2.43, p&#x0003c; 0.0001). A significant lower risk of relapses was found in patients treated with FIN in comparison to those treated with other DMDs (IRR=0.55, p=0.0014) and this result was confirmed to be unbiased by the Poisson model performed in 88 patients receiving FIN and 88 PS-matched patients receiving other DMDs (IRR=0.65, p=0.024).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our results confirm the risk of clinical disease reactivation after NTZ suspension, and indicate that an alternative treatment should be prompt resumed mainly in patients with a previous very active course.

Seroconversion rate was estimated in patients on NTZ treatment with initial negative JCVt who repeated the test during treatment.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> 222 patients performed JCVt with 63.1% being JCV+ (63.5% in first-generation ELISA test vs. 62.8% in second-generation). The prevalence of JCV+ was higher in males (69.9% vs. 60.5%, p=0.2), and increased with age (&#x0003c; 20 years: 50%, 20-39 years: 61.2%, 40-49 years: 64.3%, 50-59 years: 67.4%, &#x02265;60 years: 77.8%; r=0.970, p=0.006). 41 of the patients treated with NTZ who were initially seronegative repeated the test, 75.6% female, with median age at NTZ treatment onset of 38.5&#x000b1;10.6 years and median treatment duration of 34.6&#x000b1;20.3 months. 22% (9/41) of these patients presented seroconversion and there was a positive correlation between seroconversion and treatment duration (r=0.971, p=0.006), 1<sup>st</sup> year 2.4% (1/41), 2<sup>nd</sup> year 3% (1/33), 3<sup>rd</sup> year 8% (2/25), 4<sup>th</sup> year 15.8% (3/19) and 5<sup>th</sup> year 20% (2/10).

No other predictors of seroconversion were identified. To the best of our knowledge this is the first study reporting an increase in the seroconversion rate with treatment duration, however our cohort is very small to draw definite conclusions.

Forty-eight MS patients (mean age: 41 years) receiving interferon beta or glatiramer acetate therapy observed for 3 years, served as control group. There was no significant difference in the incidence of infections between the two groups. Four serious infections (requiring hospitalization) in the rituximab and 7 in the control group were observed (p=ns). No opportunistic infections or malignancy were observed in either group during the observation period ranging up to 72 months in the rituximab group and 36 months in the control group.

Patients were randomized to alemtuzumab 12 mg (and 24 mg in CAMMS223 and CARE-MS II) or SC IFNB-1a 44 mcg 3 times weekly. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were calculated to quantify cancer risk in alemtuzumab-treated patients compared with a retrospective MS cohort (US Clinformatics Data Mart; N=32,348). Age- and sex-adjusted incidence rates were used to determine the expected number of cases in the background cohort; confidence intervals (CIs) that include 1 suggest no additional risk of malignancy with alemtuzumab.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Through the first year of the CARE-MS extension, 1486 patients received alemtuzumab in the MS clinical trial program (median follow-up 53.4 months, 6483 person-years); of these, 23 (1.5%) had a diagnosed malignancy. No meaningful incidence trends were seen by number of treatment courses, years of follow-up, or cumulative alemtuzumab dose (overall SIR 1.27; 95% CI 0.85-1.92). Thyroid papillary carcinoma (SIR 1.57; 95% CI 0.70-3.49) was the most common malignancy; all cases were incidental findings during evaluation or treatment of autoimmune thyroid disorders. The other most common malignancies were breast cancer (SIR 0.85; 95% CI 0.35-2.04), malignant melanoma (SIR 0.88; 95% CI 0.33-2.35), and cervical carcinoma (SIR 1.93; 95% CI 0.48-7.72).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The risk of malignancies with alemtuzumab in the MS clinical trial program was not greater than that in the large MS cohort.

Due to a high number of relapses natalizumab was initiated and the patient&#x02019;s condition stabilized for 2,5 years (EDSS: 5) but then the drug had to be discontinued temporarily because of recurrent urinary infections. The patient&#x02019;s condition was stable for three months after natalizumab discontinuation and only complained of extreme fatigue and weight loss. Brain MRI at this point only showed lesions compatible with MS. Three and a half months after natalizumab discontinuation the patient exhibited marked deterioration with vomiting, vertigo, horizontal nystagmus and ataxia. A repeat brain MRI showed a non-enhancing lesion in both cerebellar penduncles compatible with PML and CSF analysis showed 150 JCV copies.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The patient received high dose of corticosteroids and IVIG with initial improvement but deterioration later on, both clinically and on the MRI, (spreading of the lesion in the brainstem). The patient received further corticosteroid treatment (both IV and per os) as well as immunomodulatory treatment with glatiramer acetate and approximately 8 months later her condition has stabilized with moderate improvement (EDSS: 7). Plasma exchange was not employed as the drug was considered to have been eliminated from the patient&#x02019;s body. Repeat MRIs showed gradual improvement of the lesion and at no point was lesion enhancement detected which would be indicative of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> As this late-onset PML case shows, clinicians should remain vigilant for PML or IRIS manifestations even after the natalizumab washout period.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section776-1352458514547846"><title>P871</title><sec id="section777-1352458514547846"><title>Evidence of cortical lesions in PML patients and differences from cortical lesions observed in multiple sclerosis: an imaging study</title><p><underline>M Calabrese</underline><sup>1</sup>, S Mariotto<sup>1</sup>, S Monaco<sup>1</sup>, S Ferrari<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>University Hospital of Verona, Dept. of Neurological and Movement Sciences, Verona, Italy</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is a rare disease with high morbidity and mortality rates, that primarily affects immunocompromised patients. It has become in the limelight as serious adverse event of some new multiple sclerosis (MS) drugs such as Natalizumab, Fingolimod, and Dimethyl Fumarate. PML does not appear exclusively a white matter (WM) disease, since several &#x0201c;cortical&#x0201d; signs as seizures, behavioural disturbances, aphasia and cortical blindness have been described. The involvement of GM has been confirmed by pathological studies but its identification in vivo is challenging with conventional MRI techniques. Double inversion recovery (DIR) is a relative new unconventional MRI sequence having a higher specificity for GM compared to other conventional sequences.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> Aim of our study is to assess the potential application of DIR sequence to confirm and describe in vivo the GM involvement in PML patients. Furthermore, we evaluate the ability of DIR in distinguishing different diseases that affect primarily the WM and particularly in the diagnosis of PML in MS patients.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Two patients with HIV-PML, 1 with HIV-related leukoencephalopathy, 3 MS subjects, 2 patients with metachromatic leukodystrophy and 5 healthy controls were recruited in the study. An experienced neurologist and a neuroradiologist interpreted the 3D DIR images by consensus.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The analysis of DIR images revealed that typical PML lesion is represented by a diffuse hemispheric WM hyperintensity that often involves cortical GM and does not respect the WM/GM junction involving also the cortical GM but not extending to the pial surface. Some focal pure intracortical lesions, again not extending to the pial surface, were also observed. On the contrary, in MS patients, several pure intracortical lesions some of which extending to the pial surface, were observed. In HIV-related leukoencephalopathy and metachromatic leukodystrophy lesions were limited to the WM and never entered the GM.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Based on our preliminary observations, we can confirm in vivo pathological data revealing that PML is also a GM disease although not extending up to pial surface differently from MS. Moreover, 3D DIR sequence may be helpful in distinguishing PML from other WM pathologies as HIV-leukoencephalopathy in immunocompromised patients.. Further studies on larger populations are required to confirm such observation that could be helpful to distinguish PML from MS cortical lesions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section778-1352458514547846"><title>P872</title><sec id="section779-1352458514547846"><title>Application of serum natalizumab levels during plasma exchange in multiple sclerosis patients with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy</title><p><underline>A Vennegoor</underline><sup>1</sup>, T Rispens<sup>2</sup>, BW van Oosten<sup>1</sup>, MP Wattjes<sup>1</sup>, MJ Wondergem<sup>1</sup>, CE Teunissen<sup>1</sup>, D van der Kleij<sup>3</sup>, BMJ Uitdehaag<sup>1</sup>, CH Polman<sup>1</sup>, J Killestein<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>VU Medical Center, Amsterdam, Netherlands, <sup>2</sup>Landsteiner Laboratory Sanquin Research, Amsterdam, Netherlands, <sup>3</sup>Sanquin Diagnostic Services, Amsterdam, Netherlands</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is a serious adverse event of natalizumab treatment.

When natalizumab is withdrawn, it is customary to associate fingolimod, with good clinical results. However, some patients may continue suffering relapses and their therapeutic management may be problematic.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To analyze over 6 months the clinical and MRI variables of a group of patients previously treated with natalizumab and most of them with fingolimod, who had received rituximab due to persistent relapse activity.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Ten patients were included in the study, 80% females, with a mean age of 38 years and a disease duration of 8 years. The mean EDSS was 3.1. All but 2 had been treated with fingolimod after natalizumab withdrawal (in one case due to lack of drug availability and in other case due to comorbidities). EDSS, number of relapses, adverse events were recorded every 3 months. MRI variables were analysed at months 0 and 6. Informed consent was obtained from each patient.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> No adverse events were observed. EDSS was stable or improved in 62.5% of patients. One patient showed confirmed progression at 6 months. A single patient, with a high annualized relapse rate before natalizumab had one relapse. No new T2 lesions or contrast enhancing lesions were found at 6 months, and the mean percentage of brain volumen change was 0.4%.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Rituximab has shown in phase II trials a significant therapeutic potential for MS. At present, new humanized and humane anti CD-20 monoclonal antibodies have replaced rituximab in ongoing clinical trials. Rituximab has been available in medicine for many years and has a well known safety profile. Although it is not an approved drug for MS, in selected cases such those of this study, it offers the possibility of being used as a rescue medication with a reasonable risk/benefit balance.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section782-1352458514547846"><title>P874</title><sec id="section783-1352458514547846"><title>Life threatening asthmatic crisis after prolonged fingolimod treatment</title><p>M Caporro<sup>1</sup>, <underline>C Gobbi</underline><sup>1</sup>, C Zecca<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Multiple Sclerosis Center, Neurocenter of Southern Switzerland, Ospedale Regionale di Lugano, Neurology, Lugano, Switzerland</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Fingolimod (FTY) is the first oral therapy approved for the treatment of relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). Its therapeutic effect in MS is exerted through the interaction with sphingosine - 1 phosphate receptors (S1P1-R), expressed on lymph cells and on a wide range of other cell types, including airway endothelial and smooth muscle cells where they mediate bronchoconstriction.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> We report the case of a woman with RRMS who experienced a life threatening episode of asthmatic bronchitis after six month of FTY treatment.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Description of a clinical case.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> A 49-yrs woman with history of mild, non-treatment requiring asthma during adolescence was diagnosed with RRMS in 1999. She switched through several disease modifying treatments due to either disease progression (interferon-beta 1-B, glatiramer acetate), or high risk of severe adverse events (mitoxantrone, natalizumab). In September 2012, 6 months after the last therapy was stopped, she was started with FTY 0.5 mg daily. A pneumologic evaluation with spirometry performed before treatment start was normal. After 6 months of treatment, the patient experienced a life-threating asthmatic crisis. The episode required patient&#x02019;s hospitalization and treatment with high doses of steroids and beta-2 agonists. FTY treatment was promptly stopped. She slowly recovered, and the respiratory parameters returned to normality on a follow-up spirometry three weeks later.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The patient with asthmatic hyper-reactivity in her youth, developed a serious respiratory adverse event after 6 months of FTY therapy. Published data show rather transitory worsening of the pulmonary function occurring within one month after FTY start both in MS and non-MS moderately asthmatic patients (1-3). Based on its mechanism of action, FTY might have precipitated bronchoconstriction in this case even in the long term.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section784-1352458514547846"><title>P875</title><sec id="section785-1352458514547846"><title>High dose glucocorticoid treatment does not contribute to reduced bone mineral density in patients with multiple sclerosis</title><p><underline>A Olsson</underline><sup>1</sup>, D Oturai<sup>1</sup>, PS Sorensen<sup>1</sup>, PS Oturai<sup>2</sup>, AB Oturai<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Copenhagen University Hospital, Rigshospitalet, Department of Neurology, Section 2082, Copenhagen, Denmark, <sup>2</sup>Copenhagen University Hospital, Rigshospitalet, Department of Clinical Physiology, Nuclear Medicine and PET, Copenhagen, Denmark</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Patients with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) are at increased risk of reduced bone mineral density (BMD).

BMD measurements were compared to a healthy age-matched reference population (Z-scores). Osteoporosis was defined as a T score &#x02264; -2.5, and osteopenia as a T score of &#x0003c; -1 to &#x0003e; -2.5 according to WHO. Cumulative GC dose during the time period with MS, age, body mass index, serum 25(OH) vitamin D levels, disease duration and severity were obtained from medical records and the Danish Multiple Sclerosis Registry. Disease severity was assessed by the Expanded Disability Status Scale. All factors were included in a multivariate regression analysis to evaluate the independent association of each risk factor and reduced BMD in MS patients.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Osteopenia was present in 38% and osteoporosis in 7% of the study population. The mean Z-score was significantly below zero, indicating a decreased BMD in our MS patients. By univariate regression analyses we found an association (p=0.002) between GC dose and BMD, but multiple linear regression analysis showed no significant association between GC dose and BMD in lumbar spine or in femoral bone. In contrast, age (p=0.002, p=0.007), BMI (p=0.041, p&#x0003c; 0.0001) and disease severity (p=0.033, p&#x0003c; 0.0001) were independently associated with both lumbar and femoral BMD, respectively.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Reduced BMD was prevalent in patients with MS. GC treatment appears not to be the primary underlying cause of secondary osteoporosis in MS patients. The principal factors associated with reduced BMD in our MS patients were increasing disease severity, increasing age and low BMI, which is in line with other studies investigating smaller cohorts.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section786-1352458514547846"><title>P876</title><sec id="section787-1352458514547846"><title>Two-years clinical and radiological activity during fingolimod post-natalizumab in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis.

In some patients, the risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) causes NTZ withdrawal despite its efficacy. Fingolimod was approved in 2011 with the same indications as NTZ.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> We present here a series of patients treated with NTZ &#x0003e;2 years and with positive antibodies to JC virus (JCV), in whom NTZ was discontinued due to safety reasons and replaced by fingolimod. We analysed the clinical, radiological activity and adverse reactions during the 2 years with fingolimod.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> We selected all JCV-positive patients treated with NTZ &#x0003e;2 years who discontinued treatment between January 2012 and January 2014. Fingolimod 0.5 mg daily was initiated 3 months after NTZ withdrawal. Electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring was performed during the first dose, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain was performed at baseline (3 months after NTZ) and at 3, 6, 12 and 24 months after fingolimod initiation; laboratory values were determined at baseline, 1 month and every 3 months.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> From January 2012 to January 2014, 20 patients (12 women) with a mean age of 39.9 years and a mean MS history of 8.9 years discontinued NTZ after a mean of 26 doses, due to risk of PML. All patients were seropositive for JCV; four had received prior immunosuppressant drugs. At NTZ discontinuation, they were clinically and radiologically stable (mean EDSS 3.5, relapse rate 0.5, annualized relapse rate (ARR) 0.27). After the first dose, ECG abnormalities were found at 24h in 21.1% of patients, 5% symptomatic. All of them resolved later on. 25% of patients had asymptomatic hypertransaminasemia, and 83% persistent lymphopenia. There were no treatment discontinuations. Mean time on fingolimod was 24.6 months. The ARR was 0.11, and EDSS at 2 years remained stable (3.5). 40% of patients had radiological activity at month 3. Later on, only 1 patient showed radiological activity at month 24. No relevant adverse reactions were observed.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The increased risk of PML is one of the most common reasons for NTZ discontinuation, which is associated with clinical and radiological relapse. Our experience suggests that fingolimod is an effective alternative option for controlling disease activity in these patients.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section788-1352458514547846"><title>P877</title><sec id="section789-1352458514547846"><title>A pilot study to assess disease state stability, efficacy, and tolerability in a natalizumab to dimethyl fumarate crossover design</title><p><underline>JF Foley</underline><sup>1</sup>, T Hoyt<sup>1</sup>, A Christensen<sup>1</sup>, D Blatter<sup>2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Rocky Mountain MS Research Group, Salt Lake City, UT, United States, <sup>2</sup>Mountain Medical Physician Specialists, Salt Lake City, UT, United States</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> While natalizumab therapy is highly efficacious for the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS), it does carry significant risk for progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) in patients who have an immunosuppressant history, &#x0003e;=24 natalizumab doses, and JCV index of &#x0003e;=1.5.

Serious IARs were rare (3.1% of patients). The most common IAR types were skin disorders (predominantly rash), headache, pyrexia, and nausea. One case of anaphylaxis occurred during Course 3 and resolved with treatment; alemtuzumab treatment was discontinued. Effective IAR management included practices before infusion (patient education and premedication [methylprednisolone]), during infusion (monitoring, symptomatic treatment, and infusion interruption/rate adjustment), and after infusion (continued monitoring for 2 hours and symptomatic treatment [antihistamines, antipyretics, and/or anti-emetics]). Few patients required infusion interruption or adjustment.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> IARs were common with alemtuzumab but were predominantly mild or moderate and decreased with treatment courses. IARs were minimized or managed during clinical trials with appropriate patient education, medication, monitoring, and infusion adjustment.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section796-1352458514547846"><title>P881</title><sec id="section797-1352458514547846"><title>JCV antibody index and adhesion molecule expression levels in natalizumab-treated multiple sclerosis patients - a cross-sectional study</title><p><underline>P Wipfler</underline><sup>1</sup>, A Harrer<sup>1</sup>, G Pilz<sup>1</sup>, K Oppermann<sup>1</sup>, J Sellner<sup>1</sup>, E Trinka<sup>1</sup>, J Kraus<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Paracelsus Medical University, Neurology, Salzburg, Austria</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> The presence of anti-JC virus (JCV) antibodies is a risk factor for progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) development in natalizumab (NTZ)-treated multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. According to recent studies JCV reactivation occurs during NTZ therapy and leads to an increase in the index levels of anti-JCV antibodies. Furthermore, an anti-JCV-Ab index level of above &#x0003e;1.5 (no prior immunosuppressive treatment of patients preexposed) has been suggested to correlate with an increased PML risk.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To explore an association between the anti-JCV antibody index in NTZ-treated MS patients and adhesion molecule (AM) expression levels on lymphocytes.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> We included 16 MS patients with a positive anti-JCV antibody (JCV-ab) serostatus (12 MS patients with anti-JCV-Ab index level of above &#x0003e;1.5) and 23 JCV-ab seronegative MS patients during NTZ treatment.

Despite demonstrated efficiency on disease course, NTZ is unfortunately associated with a risk of developing progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) that led to restriction use depending of PML risk stratification established from 3 factors: JC-virus seropositive status, prior immune therapy and treatment exposure duration (over two years). In a &#x0201c;real-life&#x0201d; clinical setting, the impact of this risk stratification on physician decision and particularly JCV serological status has been rarely evaluated.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> The objective was to study the impact of JCV seropositivity in NTZ-RR-MS treated patients. NTZ discontinuation decision-making was compared to individual risk of PML defined by its stratification.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> MS patients from two French MS centers, whose JCV serological status was known and NTZ treatment duration was six months minimum were included between October 2011 and December 2013. According PML risk stratification, we evaluated a PML risk level for all patients.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> 121 MS-patients (86 females and 35 males) were included. Mean age was 41 years, mean disease duration was 13 years and median EDSS was 3. Mean duration of NTZ treatment was 38 months. Among the patients, the rate of JCV seropositive was 71,9% (87/121). 12% (15/121) had a higher PML risk because of the presence of three risk factors and 43 % ( 52/121) a intermediary risk because they had two factors PML risks including JCV seropositive and NTZ exposure more than 24 months. PML risks for others patients (55%: 54/121) was assessed lower. In the subgroup of patient with a higher PML risk, 93% (14/15) discontinuated NTZ even thought all of JCV seronegative patients carried on treatment. In intermediary sub-group, NTZ was stopped in 24/52 (46%) patients. The main reason of interrupting NTZ was the PML risk in 55% of this cohort.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> This observational study found a correlation between the PML risk and the rate of NTZ discontinuation. JCV seropositivity had a real impact on decision to carry on with NTZ treatment.

A prompt treatment is mandatory to prevent disease activity. However, MS often affects women in their childbearing. Pregnancies in women with severe relapsing-remitting MS treated with natalizumab (NAT) currently constitute a major challenge for the risk of reactivation after drug discontinuation. In current literature, a few data of NAT efficacy and safety in pregnancy are available.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> We describe 3 women with MS, that used NAT only during the first gestational weeks (GW) and experienced a reactivation of MS during pregnancy.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Observational case reports.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> In our centre, 5 MS patients became pregnant during NAT treatment. Of these, 3 women experienced a relapse. A 34 year-old woman was treated with NAT from the age of 31. She was diagnosed to be pregnant 15 days after the last NAT infusion. Three months after NAT cessation (during 20<sup>th</sup> week gestation), she presented hypoesthesia/dysestesia at right limbs, treated with IV steroid therapy with optimal response. The other case is a 32 year-old woman treated with NAT from the age of 29, who was diagnosed to be pregnant 20 days after the last NAT infusion. Five months after NAT cessation (during 27<sup>th</sup> week gestation), she presented right limbs hyposthenia/hypoesthesia, treated with IV steroid therapy with good response. The 3<sup>rd</sup> case is a 29 year-old woman treated with NAT from the age of 28, who was diagnosed to be pregnant 15 days after the last NAT infusion. Seven months after NAT cessation (during 26<sup>th</sup> week gestation), she presented lower limb hypoesthesia, treated with IV steroid therapy with good response.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> NAT withdrawal for pregnancy may cause severe relapses but continuation might have unknown effects on the infantile immune system, due to alpha4-integrin effects on mammalian development and hematopoiesis. For this reason NAT is advised to be stopped 3 months prior to a planned pregnancy. However accidental pregnancy during MS treatment occur, so it&#x02019;s important to collect cases with MS reactivation during pregnancy. To conclude, although the poor number of our sample, the known protective effects of pregnancy on MS course would not seem to be confirmed in women who stopped NAT during GW.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section804-1352458514547846"><title>P885</title><sec id="section805-1352458514547846"><title>Multiple sclerosis as immune related adverse event after ipilimumab treatment in metastatic melanoma</title><p><underline>LA Gerdes</underline><sup>1</sup>, A Junker<sup>2</sup>, C Berking<sup>3</sup>, J Tietze<sup>3</sup>, A Straube<sup>4</sup>, FW Kreth<sup>5</sup>, R Hohlfeld<sup>1</sup>, T K&#x000fc;mpfel<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Ludwig-Maximilians-University, Institute of Clinical Neuroimmunology, Munich, Germany, <sup>2</sup>University of G&#x000f6;ttingen, Dept. of Neuropathology, G&#x000f6;ttingen, Germany, <sup>3</sup>Ludwig-Maximilians-University, Dept. of Dermatology, Munich, Germany, <sup>4</sup>Ludwig-Maximilians-University, Dept. of Neurology, Munich, Germany, <sup>5</sup>Ludwig-Maximilians-University, Dept. of Neurosurgery, Munich, Germany</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Ipilimumab (IPI) blocks the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA4) and leads to a release of a CTLA4-mediated inhibition of T-cell immunoreactions. IPI has shown increased survival rates in metastatic melanoma patients. However, IPI causes a broad spectrum of immune-related adverse events (irAEs) in about two-thirds of patients. Neurological irAES have been reported as single cases of aseptic meningitis, Guillain-Barr&#x000e9; syndrome, facial palsy, myasthenia gravis, and Tolosa-Hunt syndrome.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> This is the first case of multiple sclerosis as irAE after IPI treatment.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> A 30-year-old patient presented with metastatic melanoma originating from a nodular melanoma at his right auricle. Brain MRI on staging showed four T2 hyperintense periventricular lesions, cerebrospinal fluid analysis (CSF) revealed lymphoycytic pleocytosis and positive oligoclonal bands. Following surgery and chemotherapy he had been put on IPI treatment at 3 mg/kg body weight. Shortly later cerebral MRI showed a new T2-lesion. Chemotherapy with paclitaxel and carboplatin followed, but due to ongoing tumor disease IPI was applied again and could finally achieve tumor remission. During IPI treatment thermhypaesthesia of both feet occurred and cerebral MRI displayed disease progression (5 Gadolinium-positive lesions).</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Brain biopsy ruled out cerebral metastases, but detected a multiple sclerosis lesion with histopathological pattern I according to Lucchinetti et al. One month later optic neuritis occurred as a first clinical manifestation and the diagnosis of multiple sclerois was established. High dose glucocorticosteroids achieved partial remission of visual deficits. Follow-up MRI showed further disease progression, immunophenotyping detected increased CD4/CD8-ratio in CSF and activation of T- and B-cells in blood. Immunmodulatory treatment with interferon-beta was started and the patient is continuously under follow-up.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The temporal association of IPI administration and progression of an radiologically isolated syndrome to highly active MS is demonstrated clearly in this case promoting a causal relationship. Since IPI can only augment a pre-exisiting antigen specific immune response, MS as severe irAE unlikely reflects IPI overtreatment but the price for tumor control in a susceptible patient. Neurologists need to be alert of irAE associated with IPI treatment since the use of these agents is increasing, prompt GC treatment is effective and side effects might be misdiagnosed as brain metastases.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section806-1352458514547846"><title>P886</title><sec id="section807-1352458514547846"><title>Prevalence of anti-JC-virus antibodies in an Austrian MS-cohort: impact of gender, age and pre-treatment and analysis of cut-off-index</title><p><underline>M Auer</underline><sup>1</sup>, F Deisenhammer<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Innsbruck Medical University, Neurology, Innsbruck, Austria</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> John Cunningham virus (JCV) is known to cause rare progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) in natalizumab-treated MS-patients.

However, concerns over the safety of cladribine have been raised by American and European regulatory bodies. Specifically, a suspected increased cancer risk was key for the rejection of cladribine for pwRMS by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2011. The small number of observed cancer during CLARITY may be insufficient to definitively assess cancer risk.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> We compared the cancer risk of cladribine in CLARITY with other disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) used in the treatment of pwRMS.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> All phase III trials of approved DMTs for pwRMS were included. Fisher&#x02019;s exact test was used to compare cancer rates.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Twelve phase III trials reported cancer rates and were therefore included in this meta-analysis. Study heterogeneity was not significant. Investigated treatments in these trials were cladribine, dimethyl fumarate, fingolimod, teriflunomide, natalizumab, alemtuzumab and glatiramer acetate. The seven studies comparing treatment versus placebo (as opposed to interferon-beta 1a (IFN beta-1a)) were initially used for analysis. The cancer rate in the CLARITY treatment group (1.13%) was not increased compared to all other treatment groups, whether including placebo controlled trials only (0.6%, p= 0.1139) or all other trials, ie. including those with an IFN beta-1a comparator arm (1.05%, p=0.0951).

The impression that it would appears driven by an unusually low cancer rate in the placebo group of CLARITY. Long term follow-up will help determine the cancer risk of all DMTs. Given its efficacy, tolerability and convenience cladribine should be reconsidered for treatment of pwRMS.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section810-1352458514547846"><title>P888</title><sec id="section811-1352458514547846"><title>Fingolimod after natalizumab - Is there a rebound of MS activity?</title><p>IB Marques<sup>1</sup>, <underline>I Correia</underline><sup>1</sup>, S Batista<sup>1</sup>, C Nunes<sup>1</sup>, MC Macario<sup>1</sup>, L Sousa<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Coimbra University Hospital, Department of Neurology, Coimbra, Portugal</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Many patients with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) on Natalizumab (NTZ) are being switched to Fingolimod (FTY) because of safety issues related to Progressive Multifocal Leucoencephalopathy risk.

DNA was extracted from aliquots of the final passage of cultured MSCs and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 19 trial participants (mean age 46 years, 7 relapsing-remitting MS, 12 secondary progressive MS) and 5 normal donor controls matched on age, sex, and culture protocol. Experimental and reference DNA samples were analyzed by Ambry Genetics by comparative genomic hybridization on the 12x135K StemArray platform, a stem cell-focused array-based comparative genomic hybridization technique with probes covering the entire genome plus increased probe coverage of genes relevant to stem cell and cancer biology.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Some deletions and amplifications were detected in both the MS and control MSC samples when compared to the reference DNA; however, the majority of chromosomal alterations detected in this study were present in both MSC and germline (corresponding PBMC) samples.

These data demonstrate that the ex-vivo expansion of MSCs, according to our clinical trial protocol, does not result in cells exhibiting genomic instability, supporting the safety of the cell product used in the trial.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section817-1352458514547846"><title>P891</title><sec id="section818-1352458514547846"><title>The effects of activated immune and CNS-resident cells on human oligodendrocyte progenitor cell survival and differentiation</title><p><underline>CS Moore</underline><sup>1</sup>, Q-L Cui<sup>1</sup>, NM Warsi<sup>1</sup>, BA Durafourt<sup>1</sup>, N Zorko<sup>1</sup>, DR Owen<sup>1</sup>, JP Antel<sup>1</sup>, A Bar-Or<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>McGill University, Neurology and Neurosurgery, Montreal, QC, Canada</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> In the injured CNS, successful remyelination is largely dependent on the survival and differentiation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells. Within MS lesions, oligodendrocytes and oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) are exposed to secreted products derived from both infiltrating immune cells and CNS-resident cells. Such products may be considered either pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory, and have the potential to contribute to both injury and repair processes. During development and following inflammatory injury, astrocytes also significantly contribute to these mechanisms.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> The overall objective of the current study was to determine how functionally distinct pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory human immune cell subsets, which are implicated in MS, can directly and/or indirectly impact human oligodendrocyte progenitor cell (OPC) survival and differentiation.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Polarized T cell and myeloid cell supernatants were directly or indirectly (via astrocytes) applied to A2B5+ human OPCs. Survival, proliferation, and differentiation of OPCs was measured via TUNEL, Ki67, and immunohistochemistry, respectively.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Using A2B5+ neural progenitors, pro-inflammatory T cell (T<sub>h</sub>1/T<sub>h</sub>17) and M1-polarized myeloid cell supernatants resulted in TNF&#x003b1;-dependent cell death and an overall decrease in the percentage of O4+ and GalC+ oligodendrocyte lineage cells. Similarly, astrocyte-conditioned media collected from astrocytes pre-exposed to the same pro-inflammatory supernatants also resulted in decreased OPC differentiation; however, this was not due to cell death and was mediated through astrocyte-derived CXCL10. The use of similar media did not exert a measurable biological effect on mature O1+/MBP+ oligodendrocytes. T<sub>h</sub>2 and M2 macrophage or microglia supernatants had neither a direct nor indirect impact on OPC differentiation.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> We conclude that pro-inflammatory immune cell responses can both directly and indirectly (via astrocytes) impact the fate of immature oligodendrocyte-lineage cells, with OPCs more vulnerable to injury compared to mature oligodendrocytes. Given that astrocytes secrete a variety of factors that regulate OPC biology, it may be possible to direct the myelin repair process through modulating astrocytes. Our work suggests that future therapeutics in MS, particularly those that aim to improve the remyelination process in progressive multiple sclerosis, could be complimentary in targeting astrocytes, microglia, and infiltrated immune cells.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section819-1352458514547846"><title>P892</title><sec id="section820-1352458514547846"><title>Immune function monitoring in a phase I trial of autologous culture-expanded mesenchymal stem cell transplantation for relapsing multiple sclerosis</title><p><underline>A Bar-Or</underline><sup>1</sup>, M-N Boivin<sup>1</sup>, A Rozenberg<sup>1</sup>, T Johnson<sup>1</sup>, C Belabani<sup>1</sup>, G Morisse<sup>1</sup>, J Sirois<sup>1</sup>, S Lai Wing Sun<sup>1</sup>, S Vanamala<sup>1</sup>, A Del Rosario Villalobos<sup>1</sup>, J Reese Koc<sup>2,3</sup>, S Morrison<sup>4</sup>, RA Bermel<sup>5</sup>, PB Imrey<sup>4</sup>, SM Planchon<sup>5</sup>, JA Cohen<sup>5</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>McGill University, Montreal Neurological Institute, Montreal, QC, Canada, <sup>2</sup>Case Western Reserve University, Case Comprehensive Cancer Center and National Center for Regenerative Medicine, Cleveland, OH, United States, <sup>3</sup>University Hospitals Case Medical Center, Seidman Cancer Center, Cleveland, OH, United States, <sup>4</sup>Cleveland Clinic, Quantitative Health Sciences, Cleveland, OH, United States, <sup>5</sup>Cleveland Clinic, Mellen Center, Cleveland, OH, United States</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have immunomodulatory, tissue-protective, and repair-promoting properties <italic>in vitro</italic> and in animal models, but human MSCs paradoxically induce <italic>in vitro</italic> Th17 responses by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) under some conditions.

Entry criteria included Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) 3.0-6.5, and clinical or radiographic disease activity in the prior 2 years. Mean MSC cell dosage was 1.9x10<sup>6</sup> MSC/kg (range 1.3-2.0) requiring 1-3 passages; post-thaw viability &#x02265;95%. The primary immunological outcomes were the treatment-associated changes in percent of Th1 and Th17 CD4+ T cell responses within activated PBMCs measured by flow cytometry and intracellular cytokine staining.

Early clinical trials utilizing mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and MSC-derived neural progenitors (MSC-NPs) are currently underway to investigate their safety and efficacy in MS patient populations. MSCs and MSC-NPs have been shown to promote neurological recovery in animal models of MS through both immunoregulatory and trophic mechanisms, which alter the lesion environment to promote endogenous repair. Specifically, MSCs and MSC-NPs can proximally influence oligodendroglial and neuronal differentiation from progenitor populations. However, the mechanism(s) by which MSCs and MSC-NPs exert their trophic effects on oligodendrocytes remains unknown.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To determine whether the release of exosomes (microvesicles) by MSCs and MSC-NPs can mediate trophic effects on oligodendrocyte differentiation from neural stem cells.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> MSCs and MSC-NPs were isolated and characterized from a panel of bone marrow samples from both control and MS patients. Exosomes were isolated from MSC and MSC-NP conditioned media using Exoquick precipitation reagent, and characterized by western blot. Purified exosomes were added to rat brain-derived neural stem cells (rNSCs), which differentiate into oligodendrocytes, neurons, and astrocytes upon growth factor withdrawal. Degree of oligodendrocyte differentiation in response to exosome treatment was assayed by immunocytochemistry and quantitative PCR.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Purified exosomes from MSCs/MSC-NPs but not control cells dose-dependently promoted the differentiation of rNSCs into oligodendrocytes, as shown by increased RNA and protein expression of mature oligodendrocyte markers MBP, GalC, and PLP. Neuronal and astroglial differentiation was decreased or unchanged, respectively. Candidate exosome-associated proteins and microRNA species associated with effects on oligodendroglial differentiation were investigated.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> These observations suggest that the regenerative effects of MSC/MSC-NPs on oligodendroglial cells may be mediated by exosome release. The optimization of exosome release by MSC/MSC-NPs may have therapeutic implications in influencing the rate of CNS repair and remyelination in MS.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section823-1352458514547846"><title>P894</title><sec id="section824-1352458514547846"><title>Localization and viability of neural stem cells after therapeutic intrathecal transplantation in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis</title><p><underline>A Merlini</underline><sup>1</sup>, D De Feo<sup>1</sup>, F Ruffini<sup>1</sup>, E Brambilla<sup>1</sup>, G Comi<sup>2</sup>, G Martino<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Neuroimmunology Unit, Institute of Experimental Neurology, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy, <sup>2</sup>Institute of Experimental Neurology, Neurology Department, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Intrathecal transplantation of adult neural stem/precursor cells (NPCs) ameliorates disease severity in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), the animal model of multiple sclerosis.

EAE was induced in syngeneic mice by subcutaneous immunization with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein 35-55 peptide. One million GFP-labelled NPCs were transplanted intrathecally in the cisterna magna of EAE mice at peak of disease severity or healthy matched controls (HC). NPC survival and localization was assessed by immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry at 1, 7 and 60 days post transplantation (dpt). Each group comprised at least 4 animals.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> At 1 dpt, NPCs distributed within few millimetres from the injection site (2,46 &#x000b1;0,90 mm in EAE; 2,78 &#x000b1; 0,57 in HC), no further migration was observed at 7 and 60 dpt. At 1 dpt, 8,1% of transplanted NPCs survived in HC and 7,5% in EAE. At 7 dpt the number of surviving NPCs further decreased in both groups (HC: 2,6%; EAE: 4,6%). Indeed, a fraction of transplanted NPCs expressed the apoptotic marker activated caspase 3, with EAE mice showing a trend of reduced apoptosis at 1 dpt (HC: 3,2%; EAE: 1,5%) and at 7 dpt (HC: 3,8%; EAE: 1,4%; p&#x0003c; 0,05). Consistently, at 60 dpt NPCs transplanted in EAE mice displayed increased survival (2,7%) when compared to HC (0,3%; p&#x0003c; 0,05). In both groups, transplanted NPCs localized mainly in the subarachnoid spaces of the fourth ventricle or surrounding meninges at 1 dpt (EAE: 94,8% of surviving NPCs; HC: 87,6%) and 7 dpt (EAE: 98,5%; HC: 89,4%), with a small quota of NPCs integrating in the parenchyma. At 60 dpt, 93,5 % of surviving NPCs retained their meningeal localization in the EAE group, while in the HC group 89,4% of the surviving NPCs were found in the parenchyma.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The inflammatory environment of EAE likely does not affect NPC survival in the immediate post-transplant phase. However, 7 and 60 dpt follow-up of transplanted NPCs showed increased survival of NPCs in the EAE group compared to HC as well as different NPC localizations in the two groups, suggesting that neuroinflammation might have long-lasting effects on the behaviour of transplanted NPCs.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section825-1352458514547846"><title>P895</title><sec id="section826-1352458514547846"><title>Clinical experience in autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in refractory aggressive multiple sclerosis</title><p><underline>C Alcal&#x000e1;</underline><sup>1</sup>, F P&#x000e9;rez-Miralles<sup>1</sup>, I Bosc&#x000e1;<sup>1</sup>, F Gasc&#x000f3;n<sup>2</sup>, A Navarr&#x000e9;<sup>2</sup>, M Escutia<sup>1</sup>, A Bernad<sup>2</sup>, J de la Rubia<sup>3</sup>, F Coret<sup>2</sup>, B Casanova<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Hospital Universitari i Polit&#x000e8;cnic La Fe, MS Unit - Neurology Department, Valencia, Spain, <sup>2</sup>Hospital Cl&#x000ed;nico Universitario, Unit of Neuroimmunology - Neurology Department, Valencia, Spain, <sup>3</sup>Hospital Universitari i Polit&#x000e8;cnic La Fe, Hematology, Valencia, Spain</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Despite treatment with current first and second-line therapies, some MS patients suffer a breakthrough form, reaching significant disability in the early stages.

Presence of attacks, the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) and presence of adverse events were quarterly assessed.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Twenty-seven patients underwent BMT (19 women, mean age at diagnosis of 27.1 [SD 7.7]), 16 RRMS (72%) and 11 SPMS (44%). Mean evolution time from first attack to BMT was 8.4 years (SD 4.0), and the median of previous treatments was 3 (range 1-6). The annualized relapse rate (ARR) the year before BMT was 1.2 (SD 0.82), and the median EDSS was 4.5 (range 2-7). Most patients (63%) have been followed for a period of time &#x02265;4 years. No patients have required disease-modifying therapies during the first 4 years after BMT, only 7 patients started other therapies after a mean of 4.3 (SD 2.8) years. ARR decreased significantly at 2 (mean 0.13 [SD 0.22], p=0.001) and 4 (mean 0.20 [SD 0.36], p=0.002) years of follow-up. Most RRMS patients (83.3%) remained free from sustained-progression at the end of follow up period compared with 28.6% of SPMS patients (p=0.044). Sustained improvement was observed in 11 patients (44%), 10 RRMS patients. K-M curves showed differences in favour of patients with RRMS (median time 48 months [SE 11.5]) compared to SPMS (p = 0.039). Sixteen patients had immediate adverse reactions to BMT, 2 of them serious; 3 patients developed neoplasms (1 carcinoma in situ of the cervix, 2 breast cancers), with median time to diagnosis of 4.9 years (SD 0.6).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> BMT is an effective alternative treatment for aggressive and refractory RRMS patients. Improvement of long-time disability has been observed in this subgroup of patients. There is no evidence of modification of clinical course in SPMS patients.

CXCL10 is involved in inflammatory processes ongoing in RR and SP forms of MS and in a previous work we showed that bone marrow (BM) derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) isolated from severe MS show increased production of CXCL10. We hypothesized that BM may be indicative of a more wide inflammatory status and may be involved in disease course and in the outcome of autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (AHSCT) treatment.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To confirm CXCL10 over production and to identify molecular signature in bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and circulating monocytes isolated from RR and SP MS patients that undergo autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (AHSCT); to extend this analysis after AHSCT to test if therapy has modifying effects on MSCs and circulating monocytes.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> MSCs and monocytes were isolated from 19 MS that undergone to AHSCT before and, 7 of them, 2 years or more after transplant. CXCL10 production was detected after LPS/IFN-g stimulation. TLR4 signalling pathways was investigated by mean of transcription factors phosphorilation/activation level. RT-PCR of activated transcription factors was performed to quantify their expression. All experiments were conducted in parallel with 24 matched healthy donors (HD).</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> CXCL10 expression was significantly increased in both peripheral circulating monocytes and BM MSCs comparing to HD. We show that CXCL10 production is determined by an altered signalling pathway downstream TLR4, with the involvement of STAT1, NFkB, p38, JNK and CREB. All up regulated transcription factors are more phosphorilated in MS patient sample. These features are not modified after AHSCT.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> We demonstrate that in severe MS cells residing in two anatomical compartments are characterized by significantly increased production of CXCL10, due to altered signalling pathways of innate immune reaction mediated by TLR4 probably associated with severe disease phenotype. This characteristic is not modified by AHSCT, suggesting that when T lymphocytes are reset other possible components of MS pathology, as CXCL10 over production, do not determine therapy outcome.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section831-1352458514547846"><title>P898</title><sec id="section832-1352458514547846"><title>Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant in patients with neuromyelitis optica</title><p><underline>J Burton</underline><sup>1</sup>, J Storek<sup>2</sup>, P Duggan<sup>2</sup>, R Bell<sup>1</sup>, F Costello<sup>1</sup>, L Metz<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>University of Calgary, Department of Clinical Neurosciences, Calgary, AB, Canada, <sup>2</sup>University of Calgary, Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology, Calgary, AB, Canada</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Neuromyelitis Optica (NMO) is an idiopathic inflammatory demyelinating disease of the CNS, specifically an autoimmune astrocytopathy, that preferentially affects the optic nerves and spinal cord.

Immunocytochemistry (ICC) was conducted on dissociated NPCs (day 7); immunohistochemistry (IHC) and double immunofluorescence (dIF) were also performed on BrdU labeled normal mouse brain sections from neonates, postnates and adults (P3, P17 and 3months, respectively) using the EAE- and Na&#x000ef;ve-AS. A commercially available MOG antibody (anti-MOG) was used aiming to identify MOG- expressing cells. Neuropathological evaluation was performed using conventional and confocal microscopy.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Western blot analysis using EAE-AS revealed anti-MOG autoantibodies (26-28KDa) in SC- though not in NPCs- substrate. However, two specific bands (60KDa and 40-46KDa) were identified when NPCs-substrate was used. Na&#x000ef;ve-AS exhibited no similar results in either substrate. ICC data showed higher integrated density in dissociated NPCs stained with EAE- compared to Naive-AS (p&#x0003c; 0.0046). IHC, in all three ages, revealed a cell population, located in subventricular zone and periventricularly, that was positive for EAE- though negative for Naive-AS (p&#x0003c; 0.0001). Additionally, dIF revealed that EAE-AS had significantly higher affinity to BrdU(+) cells, when compared with anti-MOG: P3:45.43&#x000b1;8.112% versus 10.92&#x000b1;4.225%(p&#x0003c; 0.0027); P17:50.64&#x000b1;9.207% versus 10.13&#x000b1;2.519% (p&#x0003c; 0.0005); 3months:88.54&#x000b1;7.542% versus 19.49&#x000b1;11.43% (p&#x0003c; 0.0035), respectively.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Activation of the immune system against MOG<sub>35-55</sub> induces the production of antibodies apart from those related directly to the specific antigen. Furthermore, these antibodies may recognize yet unidentified epitopes other than MOG on NPCs, in SVZ. Our observations indicate a potential role of humoral response against NPCs in EAE and might provide a better understanding of MS autoimmunity.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section837-1352458514547846"><title>P901</title><sec id="section838-1352458514547846"><title>Identification of an alternative to fetal bovine serum for the culture expansion of human mesenchymal stem cells for use in clinical studies</title><p><underline>JS Reese</underline><sup>1,2</sup>, BM Hooper<sup>1,2</sup>, HM Lazarus<sup>1,2</sup>, SM Planchon<sup>3</sup>, JA Cohen<sup>3</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Case Western Reserve University, Case Comprehensive Cancer Center and National Center for Regenerative Medicine, Cleveland, OH, United States, <sup>2</sup>University Hospitals Seidman Cancer Center, Cleveland, OH, United States, <sup>3</sup>Cleveland Clinic, Melen Center, Cleveland, OH, United States</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Culture-expanded mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were evaluated for therapeutic safety in a recently completed Phase I trial in multiple sclerosis. As in our trial, standard ex-vivo culture techniques utilize a number of animal-derived components which may present a safety issue. Use of xenofree reagents is desirable to ensure the safety of human MSC cell products.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To evaluate a xenofree culture expansion media that results in efficient expansion of human bone marrow derived MSCs for use in human clinical trials.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Bone marrow aspirates were obtained from normal donors after obtaining written informed consent. Mononuclear cells were isolated by Percoll density gradient centrifugation, and cells from each donor were divided equally and grown in parallel in low glucose DMEM containing either 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) or 5% Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) grade PLUS supplement (human platelet lysate). Cultures were passaged when cells were 70% confluent. Cells were expanded for 3 passages and theoretical yield was calculated. MSC purity was assessed by presence of the surface markers CD105 and CD73 and absence of the hematopoietic cell surface markers CD45 and CD14.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Cultures containing PLUS supplement (n=5) had a 2-fold increase in the number of MSCs at primary culture and a 4-6 fold increase in cell number at subsequent passages compared to those grown in FBS (n=4). The mean MSC yield after passage 3 was 28 x 10<sup>8</sup> for cells grown with PLUS compared to 7.7 x 10<sup>8</sup> for cells grown with FBS. Additionally, the median number of days to reach a clinical dose of 1 x 10<sup>8</sup> was 17.3 days for PLUS cultures compared to 32 days for FBS. At passage 3, the purity of MSCs grown in the presence of PLUS or FBS supplement was equivalent, measured by the presence of CD105/73 and absence of CD45/14 surface markers.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The replacement of FBS with 5% PLUS supplement represents a pathogen-free GMP-compliant alternative for clinical MSC production. Addition of PLUS supplement results in expansion of a similar phenotypic population of MSCs compared to traditional culture methods using FBS, and a clinical target dose is achieved in fewer passages and less time in culture. Further physiological and immunological studies should be performed on these cells before clinical use.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section839-1352458514547846"><title>P902</title><sec id="section840-1352458514547846"><title>Assessment of bone marrow-derived cell therapy in progressive multiple sclerosis (ACTiMuS)</title><p><underline>CM Rice</underline><sup>1</sup>, DI Marks<sup>2</sup>, Y Ben-Shlomo<sup>3</sup>, N Evangelou<sup>4</sup>, C Metcalfe<sup>5</sup>, P Walsh<sup>6</sup>, DA Cottrell<sup>1</sup>, NM Kane<sup>6</sup>, A Wilkins<sup>1</sup>, NJ Scolding<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>University of Bristol &#x00026; North Bristol NHS Trust, Institute of Clinical Neurosciences, Bristol, United Kingdom, <sup>2</sup>Adult BMT Unit, Bristol, United Kingdom, <sup>3</sup>University of Bristol, School of Social &#x00026; Community Medicine, Bristol, United Kingdom, <sup>4</sup>University of Nottingham, School of Medicine, Nottingham, United Kingdom, <sup>5</sup>University of Bristol, School of Social and Community Medicine, Bristol, United Kingdom, <sup>6</sup>North Bristol NHS Trust, Dept of Neurophysiology, Bristol, United Kingdom</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> We have recently completed a phase I trial of intravenous delivery of autologous bone marrow in progressive MS (&#x02018;SIAMMS&#x02019;).

Dendritic cells (DCs) are the most potent antigen-presenting cells of the immune system, and can modulate immune responses in MS to stimulatory or tolerogenic fashion. Previous experimental studies have demonstrated that the administration of immature IL-10 modified DCs can increase an anti-inflammatory immunity (Link H. et al., 2004).</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> In order to estimate a tolerability, safety and immunological and clinical responses we investigated autologous immature IL-10 modified DCs treatment of 3 MS patients.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> The 1<sup>st</sup> patient with secondary progressive (SP) without relapses MS (M, aged 46, duration 10 ys, EDSS 6.0) who earlier had no effect on glatiramer acetate and methylprednisolone (MP) treatment; 2<sup>nd</sup> - with SP with relapses MS (F, aged 53, duration 9 ys, EDSS 5.0) who earlier had positive effect on intravenous immunoglobulins and MP; 3<sup>d</sup> - with relapsing-remitting MS (M, aged 49, duration 22 ys, EDSS 3.0) who earlier had positive effect on MP. All patients were stable more than 1 month before and don&#x02019;t received MP less than 2 months before, immunosupressants anytime and DMT less than 3 months before enrollment in the study.

Despite its prevalence, however, published results regarding its neural bases are highly heterogeneous pointing toward frontal, parietal and deep grey matter areas as well as to callosal and associative fibers as the possible neural correlates of fatigue perception in MS. Here we propose that this heterogeneity could be re-framed in a coherent model under a connectionist approach, i.e. trying to identify a discrete neural network as the neural underpinning of subjective fatigue.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To explore the neural basis of MS-related fatigue using a connectionist paradigm.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Seventy-seven patients with relapsing-remitting MS were included in this study and asked to undergo diffusion MRI and subjective fatigue levels evaluation with the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS). MFIS scores were correlated with local Fractional Anisotropy (FA) values using a whole-brain voxel-wise approach. The JHU white matter atlas included in FSL was the used to identify if any of the included tracts presented with a significant overlap with the clusters identified in the voxel-wise analysis of diffusion data.</p><p>Lastly, we used the Network Modification (NeMo) package to identify the potential loss of connectivity due to damage in the aforementioned clusters (i) to confirm the results of the atlas-based evaluation of connectivity loss and (ii) to better characterize the pattern of loss of connectivity resulting from white matter damage</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The voxel-wise regression analysis with fatigue scores revealed a significant association between structural damage and fatigue levels in two discrete white matter clusters, both included in the left cingulate bundle. The connectivity analysis revealed that damage in these clusters was associated with loss of structural connectivity in the anterior and medial cingulate cortices, dorsolateral prefrontal areas and in the left caudate.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our data point to the cingulum bundle and its projections as the key network involved in subjective fatigue perception in MS. More generally, these results suggest the potential of the connectionist framework to generate coherent models of the neural basis of complex symptomatology in MS.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section846-1352458514547846"><title>P905</title><sec id="section847-1352458514547846"><title>Long-term, sustained safety and efficacy of repeat onabotulinumtoxinA treatment in multiple sclerosis patients with neurogenic detrusor overactivity</title><p>J Panicker<sup>1</sup>, <underline>P Aliotta</underline><sup>2</sup>, G Del Popolo<sup>3</sup>, M Joshi<sup>4</sup>, B Jenkins<sup>4</sup>, Y Zheng<sup>5</sup>, A Kohan<sup>6</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, London, United Kingdom, <sup>2</sup>Western New York Urology Associates, Cheektowaga, NY, United States, <sup>3</sup>Careggi University Hospital, Florence, Italy, <sup>4</sup>Allergan, Inc., Irvine, CA, United States, <sup>5</sup>Allergan, Inc., Bridgewater, NJ, United States, <sup>6</sup>Advanced Urology Centers of New York, Bethpage, NY, United States</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Multiple sclerosis (MS) patients often have neurogenic detrusor overactivity (NDO), which can result in urinary incontinence (UI). Intradetrusor onabotulinumtoxinA (onabotA; BOTOX<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>; Allergan, Inc.) has been shown to be well tolerated and effective in the treatment of NDO due to MS or spinal cord injury in two phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in patients who were not adequately managed by an anticholinergic. A large, multicenter, extension study has been conducted to investigate the long-term efficacy and safety of repeat onabotA treatments.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To present the final long-term efficacy and safety results of repeat onabotA in the cohort of MS patients.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Patients who completed a phase 3 trial of onabotA were invited to continue to receive multiple intradetrusor onabotA injections (200U or 300U) in the extension study. Patients were treated on an &#x02018;as needed&#x02019; basis (based on patient request and investigator assessment of predefined retreatment criteria), so the number of treatments needed during the study differed between patients. Change from study baseline (BL) in UI episodes/day, proportion of patients with 100% reduction in UI; duration of effect (time to request for retreatment), adverse events (AEs) and initiation of CIC were assessed.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> 231 MS patients received &#x02265;1 onabotA treatment over 4 years. Repeat onabotA treatments consistently reduced the number of UI episodes/day; mean reductions from BL at week 6 following onabotA were consistent, ranging from -3.6/day to -3.9/day (onabotA 200U) over 5 treatments. 45.2-61.9% of patients achieved complete continence at week 6 following onabotA 200U over 5 treatments. Median duration of effect was 36.3 weeks in MS patients with complete treatment cycles (200U). Efficacy results for onabotA 300U were comparable. Most common AEs (onabotA 200U) were uncomplicated urinary tract infection (58.3, 47.4, 47.6, 40.2, and 34.4%; cycles 1-5, respectively) and urinary retention; rates were higher in the 300U group. De novo CIC rates were 28.8, 4.2, 7.1, 0, and 0% in the 200U group (cycles 1-5, respectively) and were higher with 300U. Annualized MS exacerbation rates ranged from 0.03-0.15 (200U). Discontinuation rates due to AEs/lack of efficacy were low (3.3%/1.7%).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Repeat onabotA treatment consistently reduced UI in MS patients with NDO who were not adequately managed by an anticholinergic, with no new safety concerns identified over 4 years&#x02019; follow-up.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section848-1352458514547846"><title>P906</title><sec id="section849-1352458514547846"><title>Prolonged-release fampridine enhances physical activity during everyday life in patients with multiple sclerosis (FAMPKIN)</title><p><underline>D Weller</underline><sup>1</sup>, T Sutter<sup>1</sup>, B Z&#x000f6;rner<sup>1</sup>, L Filli<sup>1</sup>, L L&#x000f6;rincz<sup>1</sup>, K Reuter<sup>1</sup>, M Farkas<sup>1</sup>, S Kapitza<sup>1</sup>, M Linnebank<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>University Hospital Zurich, Department of Neurology, Zurich, Switzerland</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Treatment with prolonged-release fampridine has shown beneficial effects on walking ability in a subset of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS).

Physical activity of patients was examined during two double-blind treatment phases (6 weeks each), in which the patients were either treated with fampridine (10mg twice daily) or placebo. Patients were equipped with an actimeter device fixed on their more impaired leg. The device recorded acceleration data with a sampling rate of 32Hz and averaged the data over 15 second intervals. Physical activity was measured over a period of 14 days during both treatment phases. The study population was classified into fampridine responders (n=17) and non-responders (n=30) based on criteria defined by Goodman and colleagues (Lancet, 2009).</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Physical activity was not altered by fampridine in the total study population (n=55). In contrast, the group of fampridine responders revealed a significant increase in the summated daily activity (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0261, paired Student&#x02019;s t-test) and in the average activity count per 15 second interval (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0179). These fampridine-related changes in physical activity were not observed in the group of non-responders (<italic>P</italic> = 0.8288 and <italic>P</italic> = 0.9139 respectively). The total time of activity during the waking phase was not different between the fampridine and placebo treatment phase for any group, thus implying that the intensity rather than the time of activity is primarily modified by fampridine in patients with MS.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> These results demonstrate for the first time that fampridine is able to enhance the physical activity of patients with MS during everyday life. This data emphasizes the clinical relevance of the fampridine treatment for daily living of patients with MS-associated gait deficits. Furthermore, this data indicates that the treatment-induced improvements observed in the FAMPKIN study (walking speed, endurance, coordination etc.) might positively affect the quality of life of patients with MS.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section850-1352458514547846"><title>P907</title><sec id="section851-1352458514547846"><title>Thalamic dysfunction is associated with fatigue in patients with multiple sclerosis: a graph theory study</title><p><underline>M Filippi</underline><sup>1,2</sup>, P Valsasina<sup>1</sup>, A Bisecco<sup>1</sup>, A Meani<sup>1</sup>, L Parisi<sup>1</sup>, MJ Messina<sup>2</sup>, B Colombo<sup>2</sup>, A Falini<sup>3</sup>, G Comi<sup>2</sup>, MA Rocca<sup>1,2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Vita-Salute San Raffaele University, Neuroimaging Research Unit, Institute of Experimental Neurology, Milan, Italy, <sup>2</sup>San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Vita-Salute San Raffaele University, Department of Neurology, Milan, Italy, <sup>3</sup>San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Vita-Salute San Raffaele University, Department of Neuroradiology, Milan, Italy</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Fatigue affects a large proportion of patients with MS.

As control groups, 60 MS patients without fatigue (NF) matched for disease duration and brain T2 lesion volume with F-MS patients and 59 gender and age-matched healthy controls (HC) were included. Functional connectivity between 116 cortical and subcortical brain regions was estimated using a bivariate correlation analysis. Small-worldness properties were tested by comparison with matched random networks. Hubs were defined as regions having either degree or betweeness centrality one standard deviation greater than network average. Between-group differences of global and local network metrics were investigated using ANOVA models.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Small-worldness (i.e., high clustering and short paths) was verified in all study groups. All global network parameters were significantly altered in F-MS patients and NF-MS patients compared with HC, with no significant differences between F- and NF-MS patients.

Gait profiles including parameters such as stride length, step width, and range of motion of different joints revealed substantial fampridine-induced gait modifications in most responders, however, the changes were different between the individual subjects. Summarized, modifications of the gait pattern were most frequently found in proximal leg joints (hip and knee), whose range of motion was increased under fampridine. The motion of the trunk during walking was smaller during the fampridine treatment, implying an increased dynamic stability.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The kinematic and kinetic data imply that fampridine induces differential gait modifications that are likely to depend on the individual deficits of a given patient. We hypothesize that the observed modifications of the gait pattern underlie the clinical improvement induced by the fampridine treatment.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section854-1352458514547846"><title>P909</title><sec id="section855-1352458514547846"><title>Clinical features of patients presenting with seizures at the time of multiple sclerosis diagnosis: a 12-year retrospective case-control study</title><p><underline>A Jammoul</underline><sup>1</sup>, J Kim<sup>1</sup>, C Newey<sup>2</sup>, A Rae-Grant<sup>3</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Neurology, Cleveland, OH, United States, <sup>2</sup>University of Chicago Medical Center, Chicago, IL, United States, <sup>3</sup>Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Mellen Center for Multiple Sclerosis, Cleveland, OH, United States</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Seizures occur at about a rate of 2-4% in the MS population.

Group 1 comprised 38 cases that developed seizures following a diagnosis of MS. Group 2 consisted of the remaining 17 patients (31%) who had a seizure that led to the diagnosis of MS. Among the Group 2 patients, 10 experienced a seizure as part of the initial clinical presentation, while the other 7 cases (13%) were determined to have had their first MS-related symptom prior to seizure onset by a median time of 42 months. Average age at MS diagnosis did not differ between Group 1 and 2 (30 vs 34 years, respectively, <italic>p</italic> = 0.11). No significant difference was detected in gender distribution (11/38 males in group 1 vs 7/17 males in group 2, <italic>p</italic> = 0.38) nor in the proportion of patients with stable MS on last follow up (18 in group 1 vs 11 in group 2, <italic>p</italic> = 0.23). Further comparisons of disease characteristics will be presented at the meeting.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Seizures at the onset of MS are not uncommon and occurred in almost one fifth of MS patients who developed seizures in our cohort. The 2:1 female-to-male ratio of seizure incidence in MS was equal to the gender ratio of MS incidence in the general population suggesting that there is no gender-specific epileptogenic factor in MS patients with seizures. Our study is the first to compare the clinical features of MS patients presenting with seizures at the time of their MS diagnosis versus those who develop seizures subsequent to their MS diagnosis. Large-scale prospective studies following MS patients and evaluating them for seizure onset are needed to shed more light on the intriguing intersection of MS and seizures.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section856-1352458514547846"><title>P910</title><sec id="section857-1352458514547846"><title>I.

This body temperature difference was observed in the absence of environmental manipulations (e.g., hot baths and exercise), importantly suggesting endogenous processes that may reflect disease-related inflammatory events.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> Here, our aim was to replicate the finding of elevated body temperature in MS patients relative to healthy controls in a large sample comprising data from three separate MS centers in two countries.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Core body temperature was measured in 111 relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) patients and 84 age-matched healthy controls with an infrared aural thermometer (Braun ThermoScan IRT 4520). Both groups were 70% female in composition. Average disease duration for the MS group was 12.7&#x000b1; 8.2 years.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> MS patients had higher core body temperature than matched healthy controls (p=.003). Average body temperature for MS was 37.00&#x000b0;C &#x000b1; 0.31, and for HC was 36.87&#x000b0;C &#x000b1; 0.32. The group temperature difference remained after controlling for age, sex, and recruitment center (p&#x0003c; .001). All effect sizes were medium.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Here, we replicate the finding of elevated body temperature in RRMS compared to HC in a large, multi-center sample comprising data from three sites and two countries. Elevated body temperature in MS was recently shown to be linked to increased fatigue (Sumowski &#x00026; Leavitt, 2014), therefore supporting the use of antipyretics and cooling garments as effective treatments for fatigue. Future investigations of antipyretics in the treatment of fatigue are warranted. Body temperature fluctuations in RRMS may signify fluctuations in disease-related inflammatory processes, including subclinical exacerbations. As such, monitoring body temperature may represent a simple means of detecting quiescent disease activity, a link that remains to be tested in future work.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section858-1352458514547846"><title>P911</title><sec id="section859-1352458514547846"><title>Detailed characterization of the effects of prolonged-release fampridine on walking function in patients with multiple sclerosis (FAMPKIN)</title><p><underline>B Z&#x000f6;rner</underline><sup>1</sup>, K Reuter<sup>1</sup>, L Filli<sup>1</sup>, L L&#x000f6;rincz<sup>1</sup>, D Weller<sup>1</sup>, T Sutter<sup>1</sup>, M Farkas<sup>1</sup>, S Kapitza<sup>1</sup>, M Linnebank<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>University Hospital Zurich, Department of Neurology, Zurich, Switzerland</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Recent studies demonstrated the beneficial effects of fampridine (4-aminopyridine) on gait velocity in a subset of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS).

FAMPKIN designed as a phase II, double-blind, randomized and placebo-controlled cross-over study assessed gait function during two double-blind fampridine or placebo treatment phases (each 6 weeks).</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Walking was investigated using different clinical tests, questionnaires and detailed kinematic-kinetic gait analysis. 55 patients with relapsing-remitting, primary- and secondary-progressive MS completed the study (34 women, 21 men; age 48.4 +/- 9.7 years; median EDSS = 4.5). Patients were classified into responder and non-responder according to the criteria used by Goodman <italic>et al.</italic> (Lancet, 2009). 31% (n=17) of all participants were fampridine-responder, 5% (n=3) were placebo-responder, and 9% (n=5) met the responder criteria in both phases.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> During fampridine treatment, gait velocity (timed-25-foot walk) was increased by 5.8% in the total population (n=55), 12.3% in the pure fampridine-responder subgroup (n=17), and by 3.3% in non-responders (n=29) compared to the placebo treatment. Walking endurance (6-minute walk test) was improved by 8.5% in the total population, 13.5% in responders, and 6.1% in non-responders.

The only exclusion criterion was a relapse in the last month before the beginning of the study. The questionnaire included demographic data, year of symptom onset and diagnosis, Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), clinical course, Beck Scale, QoL36, Disease modifying treatment, pain therapy, the DN4 questionnaire for differential diagnosis of pain syndromes associated to neuropathic or nociceptive pain. In subjects with DN4 greater than 4 NPSI scale were administered. We considered only symptoms present at the time of the interview.

Spinal cord (SC) damage represents a significant risk factor for RLS in MS patients in several studies. However, the relationship between RLS and SC lesions in MS is still unclear.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> The aim of this study is to investigate the sleep quality (SQ) and the prevalence of RLS and depression in patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS).</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> A total of 93 RRMS patients (67 females, 26 males, mean age 34,5 &#x000b1; 8,6) were enrolled in the study. The diagnosis of RLS was based on International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group Criteria. SQ was assessed by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) by the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), depression by the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and clinical disability by the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS). The severity of depression, SQ and the prevalence of RLS were compared between the patients with and without cervical SC lesions. The correlation of RLS with SQ, depression and clinical disability was also investigated.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Patients aged 18 to 49 years with disease duration of 1 to 20 years (mean 4,7 years &#x000b1; 3,7) were evaluated. Forty patients (43%) had only brain lesions, whereas 53 patients (57%) had coexistent cervical SC lesions. Patients with SC damage exhibited poorer sleep (P = 0.03) and tended to have greater depressive symptoms (P = 0.06). Thirty subjects (32,3%, mean age 34,1 &#x000b1; 8,5) met the criteria for RLS and RLS was significantly higher in patients with cervical SC lesions (P = 0.04). RLS was also associated with poorer sleep (P = 0.0001) and higher rates of depression (P = 0.0001). By comparing the RLS group with the group without RLS, no significant differences were found in MS duration, gender and the presence of upper motor neuron signs. But RLS group presented higher EDSS scores. EDS was detected in only 5 subjects (5,3%) and was not associated with any of the studied parameters.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> RRMS with the cervical SC involvement was significantly associated with RLS. Changes in the distal A11 neuron synapses, main source of dopaminergic input into the SC and damage of this neural pathway due to MS lesions may lead to spinal network changes consistent with RLS, but larger studies are needed to clarify the pathological mechanism. RLS has a negative impact on SQ and mood. High awareness of RLS in MS is required.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section864-1352458514547846"><title>P914</title><sec id="section865-1352458514547846"><title>Reassessment of Lhermitte&#x02019;s sign in multiple sclerosis</title><p><underline>Y Beckmann</underline><sup>1</sup>, S &#x000d6;zakba&#x0015f;<sup>2</sup>, NG B&#x000fc;lb&#x000fc;l<sup>1</sup>, G K&#x000f6;sehasano&#x0011f;ullar&#x00131;<sup>3</sup>, Y Se&#x000e7;il<sup>4</sup>, O Bulut<sup>3</sup>, TK &#x00130;ncesu<sup>5</sup>, F Toku&#x000e7;o&#x0011f;lu<sup>5</sup>, C Ertekin<sup>5</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Izmir Katip Celebi University, Atat&#x000fc;rk Training and Research Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, Neurology, Izmir, Turkey, <sup>2</sup>9 Eyl&#x000fc;l University Medical School, Neurology, Izmir, Turkey, <sup>3</sup>9 Eyl&#x000fc;l University Medical School, Izmir, Turkey, <sup>4</sup>Izmir Katip Celebi University, Atat&#x000fc;rk Training and Research Hospital, Izmir, Turkey, <sup>5</sup>Izmir Katip Celebi University, Atat&#x000fc;rk Training and Research Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, Izmir, Turkey</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> The reliability and diagnostic value of Lhermitte&#x02019;s sign in multiple sclerosis (MS) has not been fully established.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> The purpose of this study was to determine the clinical, neurophysiological and neuroradiological correlations of Lhermitte&#x02019;s sign in a cohort of MS patients and reassess the relevance of this phenomenon in the clinical history of the disease.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> A prospective study of 694 patients with MS and 110 age-matched healthy adults were evaluated by a structured questionnaire that included basic demographic data, age of onset, clinical characteristic of the disease, and the inquiry of Lhermitte&#x02019;s sign.

Additionally, some studies have reported sleep disturbances including reduced sleep efficiency (SE), periodic limb movements of sleep (PLMS), and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in MS patients. The inter-relationship between symptoms and objective measures of sleep in MS patients is poorly understood.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> The objectives of this study were to document objective parameters of sleep measured by polysomnography (PSG) and multi-sleep latency tests (MSLT) in a population of MS patients experiencing fatigue or sleepiness and to determine whether they correlate with measures of fatigue, sleepiness, mood or cognition.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Fatigue, sleepiness, depression, and cognition were assessed in 37 patients by performance of the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS), Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), Visual Analog Scale - Fatigue (VAS-F), Beck Depression Index (BDI) and NeuroTrax<sup>TM</sup> cognitive tests during the screen visit. Within one month, 32 patients reporting fatigue or sleepiness underwent PSG followed by MSLT.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> This MS patient cohort averaged an SE of 75.1%, Wake after Sleep Onset (WASO) of 66.2 minutes, Sleep Onset Latency (SOL) of 43.36 minutes, and Multi-Sleep Latency of 10.43 minutes. No Stage 3 sleep was recorded in 10 subjects and no Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep was recorded in 4 patients. An elevated PLMS Index was observed in eight of the 32 patients. An Apnea Hypopnea Index (AHI) &#x0003e; 5 was observed in 12 of the 32 patients. Neither SE nor WASO correlated with fatigue or sleepiness.

Sites were selected following identification by the manufacturer as high-prescribing centres. Data were collected retrospectively from medical records of 250 patients prescribed nabilone between 1<sup>st</sup> January 2005-March 2013, mean observation period 31.1 (standard deviation (SD) 22.8) months.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> MS was the most common distinct condition for which nabilone was prescribed (19%, 48/247 patients with data recorded). Results are presented here for these 48 patients. Where n&#x0003c; 48, data were missing from medical records. 67% (32/48) patients were female. At nabilone initiation mean age was 51.9 (SD 9.0) years and prior symptom duration 6.9 (6.7) years (n=33); 76% (28/37) patients had been prescribed &#x02265;3 other classes of medication for the same symptoms. Nabilone was most commonly prescribed for pain (81%, 29/36) and spasticity (61%, 22/36). 50% (21/42) patients started on 1mg and 38% (16/42) on &#x0003c; 1mg daily. 52% (25/48) patients were recorded as benefitting from nabilone; most common benefits were pain relief (n=19), improved sleep (n=15) and spasticity relief (n=7). 31% (15/48) patients were recorded as experiencing adverse effects, most commonly drowsiness (n=8), fatigue (n=5) and dizziness (n=2).

Although most patients prescribed nabilone for MS had experienced symptoms for many years and had been prescribed a number of other medications, over half derived benefit and adverse effects were no different to other CNS-active medications. The cost of nabilone should be considered in light of numbers of prior treatments and the comparatively high cost of other MS medications.

The Obersteiner-Redlich zone of the trigeminal nerve root entry zone refers to the area of transition between the myelin-producing oligodendrocytes of the central nervous system and the Schwann cells of the peripheral nervous system in the trigeminal nerve. MRI findings that involve the central intrapontine tract or the Obersteiner-Redlich zone of the trigeminal nerve are seen in approximately 3% to 38% of patients with MS, although imaging abnormalities do not always reliably correlate with clinical symptoms.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> We present the case of a MS patient with facial sensory symptoms and corresponding imaging findings.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> A 33-year-old woman with a history of relapsing-remitting MS presented with two days of left facial numbness and incoordination. Examination revealed diminished facial sensation, impaired taste sensation on the left anterior tongue, and dysmetria on the left. She underwent MRI brain imaging.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> MRI brain showed T2/FLAIR hyperintensity and enhancement of the Obersteiner-Redlich zone that extended to the trans-cisternal portion of the left trigeminal nerve. Imaging also showed increased T2 signal of the left trigeminal nuclei, particularly the main sensory nucleus in the pons and the spinal nucleus in the medulla. She demonstrated clinical and radiological improvement after treatment with intravenous steroids and plasmapheresis.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Although the immunogenic target of MS is considered to be myelin of the central nervous system, there can also be involvement of the Obersteiner-Redlich transition zone and of the peripheral cranial nerves in MS. This is demonstrated by our patient&#x02019;s clinical and radiological findings.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section876-1352458514547846"><title>P920</title><sec id="section877-1352458514547846"><title>Efficacy, safety and response rate of nabiximols assessed in an Italian monocentric cohort</title><p><underline>L Ferr&#x000e8;</underline><sup>1,2</sup>, M Sorosina<sup>2</sup>, S Santoro<sup>2</sup>, L Moiola<sup>1</sup>, M Rodegher<sup>1</sup>, B Colombo<sup>1</sup>, A Nuara<sup>1,3</sup>, L Leocani<sup>1,3</sup>, V Martinelli<sup>1</sup>, G Comi<sup>1</sup>, F Martinelli Boneschi<sup>1,2</sup>, F Esposito<sup>1,2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Scientific Institute San Raffaele, Institute of Experimental Neurology, Neurology Department, Milan, Italy, <sup>2</sup>Scientific Institute San Raffaele, Institute of Experimental Neurology, Laboratory of Neurogenetics of Complex Disease, Milan, Italy, <sup>3</sup>Scientific Institute San Raffaele, Institute of Experimental Neurology, Experimental Neurophysiology Unit, Milan, Italy</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patients often suffer from limb spasticity and pain that are not adequately controlled by common antispastic drugs. Nabiximols is a cannabinoid-based drug that proved effective in reducing spasticity and pain in MS.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To assess nabiximols efficacy and safety in clinical practice, by evaluating an Italian cohort of MS patients followed at the San Raffaele Hospital in Milan, and to identify clinical features associated with response.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> All patients that started nabiximols at our MS center were enrolled. The following clinical data were collected prospectively at baseline and after 4 and 14 weeks: expanded disability status scale (EDSS), Ambulation index (AI), 10mt walk test (10MWT), numerical rating scale for spasticity (sNRS) and pain (pNRS). After 4 weeks, responder status was defined by at least a 20% reduction in sNRS compared to baseline.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Since September 2013, 74 patients started nabiximols, 32 being females and 42 males (F:M ratio 0.76). Mean age at therapy start was 48,5 years (22,4-76,9) and mean disease duration was 17,5 years (5,4-42). Ten patients had a relapsing remitting course while 64 had a progressive disease, either primary (11) or secondary (53). At baseline median EDSS was 6.5 and median AI was 6. All patients complained of moderate to severe spasticity, with a mean sNRS of 7,5. Fifty-nine patients reached a 4-week follow-up: 18 subjects (30,5%) were classified as non-responders with a mean 3% increase in sNRS after one month. Two patients (3,4%) were responders based on evidence of reduced spasticity but discontinued treatment because of adverse effects (fatigue, confusion). Thirty-nine patients (66,1%) were full responders, with a mean sNRS reduction of 30% and no relevant tolerability issues. Responder group also showed a significant decrease in pNRS (-30%) and AI (&#x02265;1 point improvement in 6 patients). No significant differences in baseline variables were observed between the two groups.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> This study confirms nabiximols efficacy in reducing MS-related spasticity and pain; no major adverse events were reported. We observed a higher responder rate (66%) compared to other cohorts described in the literature. This is maybe because many patients started nabiximols based on the evidence of benefit from previous administration of cannabis infusions. We didn&#x02019;t found significant baseline clinical differences in the two response groups, perhaps due to the limited sample size.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section878-1352458514547846"><title>P921</title><sec id="section879-1352458514547846"><title>Changes in functional impairment in persons with multiple sclerosis treated with dalfampridine</title><p><underline>AC Lo</underline><sup>1,2,3</sup>, JA Ruiz<sup>1</sup>, BM Anderson<sup>1</sup>, KM Olson<sup>1</sup>, EW Triche<sup>1,2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Mount Sinai Rehabilitation Hospital, Mandell Center for Multiple Sclerosis, Hartford, CT, United States, <sup>2</sup>Brown University, Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Providence, RI, United States, <sup>3</sup>Brown University, Department of Neurology, Providence, RI, United States</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Functional capacity can be defined as a person&#x02019;s ability to perform social and occupational activities. Impairments which limit capacity may impact functional performance and quality of life in persons with multiple sclerosis (pwMS).

During the 14 week study, participants were monitored immediately prior to starting D-ER (baseline) and at four follow-up time points. Functional measures included the Barthel Index, Patient Determined Disease Steps Scale (PDDS), total Performance Scale score (PS), number of falls in the past two weeks and the use of assistive devices. Fifty-two participants were enrolled and 31 met criteria for analysis. In addition to the analysis of all 31 participants, the data were subdivided into timed walk responders (TWRs; n=21) and timed walk non-responders (TWNRs; n=8) to assess whether the relationship between D-ER and functional outcomes differs between the responder groups.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Examination of participants taking D-ER for the 14 week study period (n=31) showed improvement on the PS (<italic>p</italic>=.032) and a trend towards improvement on the PDDS (<italic>p</italic>=.085).

Patients (18-70 years) with progressive or relapsing-remitting MS and EDSS score of 4-7 were treated with PR-fampridine 10mg tablets or placebo twice daily for 24 weeks. Efficacy endpoints assessed at baseline and at Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24 included change from baseline in the 12-item MS walking scale (MSWS-12), Timed Up and Go (TUG) test, Berg Balance Scale (BBS), 29-item MS impact scale (MSIS-29) physical subscale, and the EuroQol (EQ-5D-5L) VAS and utility index scores.

PR-fampridine treatment vs placebo resulted in greater and sustained mean improvements over 24 weeks (median treatment difference [95% CI]) on the MSWS-12 (-3.27 [-7.59, 1.19]), TUG speed (9.64% [2.05%, 16.48%]), BBS (1.50 [0.00, 2.93]), and MSIS-29 physical subscale (-3.30 [-7.68, 0.98]). After treatment discontinuation at Week 24, benefits returned to baseline levels. No clear differences between treatment groups were observed for the EQ-5D VAS and utility index results. Over 24 weeks, a higher proportion of patients randomized to PR-fampridine vs placebo experienced clinically meaningful improvements on the MSWS-12 (&#x02265;8 point mean improvement): 48.5% vs. 28.1% (<italic>P</italic>=0.015); and TUG speed (&#x02265;15% mean improvement): 47.1% vs. 30.2% (<italic>P</italic>=0.026), respectively.

MS patients who had failed oral anti-spasticity treatment (due to undesired side effects and/or unsatisfactory control of their spasticity) were submitted to an intrathecal trial injection of 50mcg baclofen. A pump for the intrathecal administration of baclofen was implanted to the patients who responded favorably to the baclofen trial.

Study enrollment began April 16, 2012 with 128 current sites primarily in Germany and France. Data were collected at the enrollment visit (baseline) and during follow-up visits according to local routine clinical practices; data collected between Day 136 and 270 are reported as Month 6 follow-up. Patients who discontinued treatment were encouraged to stay in the study (patients off treatment). Endpoints included incidence of adverse events (AEs), physician-assessed Clinical Global Impression of Improvement (CGI-I) of walking ability and patient&#x02019;s assessment of impact of MS using the Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale-29 Items (MSIS-29).

Especially the high intake rate of other drugs point to a more specialised NPC treatment of MS patients beside pain control.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Using the HOPE (HOspice and Palliativ Evaluation) database the medical treatment taken at admission, EDSS and demographic data of MS patients of our center collected from January to December 2013 were analysed.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Data of 110 patients (female = 64; mean age = 55 years &#x000b1; 11.1 years, range 24 - 83 years) of MSK could be analysed.

In the group of the 110 patients an amount of 145 different API was given. Beside the standardised used drug classification of the HOPE database additional classes of drugs, e.g. antispastic (87 patients, 8 different API), antiepileptic (87 patients, 16 different API), urological drugs (86 patients, 13 different API), or antidepressant /neuroleptic drugs (59 patients, 15 different API) were necessary to describe the range of treatment.

Furthermore, the underlying structural and functional correlates of MS tremor are poorly understood. Detailed phenomenological studies are needed to characterize MS-tremor and investigate factors that may predict its severity.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To investigate clinical factors that contributes to MS-tremor severity. To determine if dystonia is more common in MS tremor patients than non-tremor controls.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Fifty-four MS patients, with and without disabling upper limb tremor (uni- or bilateral), matched for age, sex and disability (EDSS and disease duration) were recruited resulting in 39 limbs per group. Cerebellar function was rated using the SARA score. Severity of tremor (including writing and drawing) was rated using the Bain score and dystonia (Global Dystonia Scale (GDS) for proximal and distal upper limbs) using standardized video and handwriting recordings. Samples were shuffled and rated by a blinded movement disorder expert. Dystonic features (including dystonic posturing, mirror movements, geste antagonistes and writer&#x02019;s cramp) were scored for presence and severity using a five-point scale.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Significant associations (p&#x0003c; 0.05) between EDSS, distal more than proximal GDS, SARA scores and Bain scores were found. Upper limb GDS were significantly (p&#x0003c; 0.001) worse in patients with tremor than those without. Dystonic features including geste antagonistes, mirror dystonia and dystonic posturing were more frequent and more severe (p&#x0003c; 0.001) in tremor patients. In a multi-variable model, a 1-unit increase in distal GDS predicted: 0.52-unit (95% CI 0.08 to 0.97), p = 0.022) increase in tremor severity; 0.8-units (95% CI -0.07 to 1.6, p = 0.070) increase in writing severity and a 1-unit (95% CI 0.48 to 1.6, p= 0.001) increase in Bain drawing scores. A 1 unit increase in proximal GDS predicted: 0.93-unit increase (95% CI 0.45 to 1.41, p &#x0003c; 0.001) in tremor severity score; 0.99-units (95% CI 0.00 to 1.99), p=0.050) increase in writing scores and 1.5-units (95% CI 0.62 to 2.41, p = 0.002) increase in Bain drawing score.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The results of this study demonstrate the importance of recognizing dystonia as part of the complex movement disorder that represents MS tremor. The presence of dystonia points to injury in the cerebello-pallido-thalamo-cortical network and could explain the efficacy of onabotulinumtoxin-A therapy in the treatment of MS tremor.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section890-1352458514547846"><title>P927</title><sec id="section891-1352458514547846"><title>Efficiency sulbutiamine for treatment of fatigue in patients with multiple sclerosis</title><p><underline>Y Khyzhniak</underline><sup>1,2</sup>, T Kobus<sup>2</sup>, O Mialovytska<sup>2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Bogomolets National University, Neurology, Kyiv, Ukraine, <sup>2</sup>Bogomolets National University, Kyiv, Ukraine</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Multiple sclerosis is the most common autoimmune inflammatory disease in young adults.

Estimates of the prevalence of SD in the MS population range between 40-80%. Pharmacological treatment trials have had only limited efficacy; thus, behavioral treatments need to be explored.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To conduct a pilot randomized control trial of a brief two-visit multidisciplinary behavioral intervention utilizing a consultation model for adults with MS and sexual dysfunction. Further, to test the hypothesis that the intervention group will experience significant improvements compared to a control group in sexual functioning as measured by the Multiple Sclerosis Intimacy and Sexuality Questionnaire-19 (MSISQ-19).</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Participants were recruited from the Holy Name Medical Center MS Center. A total of 50 participants were recruited, 25 randomized to the intervention group and 25 to the control group. Those in the control group received educational materials on the topic of sexuality and intimacy in MS. Those in the intervention group received two consultation intervention sessions along with their sexual partner, each separated by one month to allow for completion of practice assignments between sessions. In both groups, participants completed baseline as well as 2-month outcome measures. The primary outcome measure is the MSISQ-19. The secondary outcome measure is the Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life Inventory.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Data were analyzed using a mixed-model ANOVA with MSISQ-19 as the criterion variable. An interim analysis of 24 of the 50 participants (data collection to be completed 7/2014) shows a significant main effect for timepoint, F (1, 22) = 4.76, p = .04. Regardless of treatment group, there was a significant reduction in sexual symptoms from baseline to follow-up. However, there was neither a main effect for treatment group F (1, 22) = 1.38, p = .253, nor an interaction effect (1, 22) = 0.01, p = .920. Thus, preliminary results indicate that both intervention sessions and educational materials reduce sexual symptoms significantly but that there is no difference in their efficacy. Additionally, qualitative reports from both intervention and control participants reveal improved sexual satisfaction and reduced sexual symptoms.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Behavioral and educational interventions have the potential to improve sexual functioning and sexual satisfaction for people living with MS.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section894-1352458514547846"><title>P929</title><sec id="section895-1352458514547846"><title>Long-term effects of fampridine on walking ability in patients with multiple sclerosis: a phase II, open-label, uncontrolled, monocenter study</title><p><underline>L Filli</underline><sup>1</sup>, S Kapitza<sup>1</sup>, K Reuter<sup>1</sup>, L L&#x000f6;rincz<sup>1</sup>, D Weller<sup>1</sup>, T Sutter<sup>1</sup>, M Farkas<sup>1</sup>, B Z&#x000f6;rner<sup>1</sup>, M Linnebank<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>University Hospital Zurich, Department of Neurology, Zurich, Switzerland</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> The beneficial effect of fampridine, a blocker of voltage-gated potassium channels, on walking speed in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) was demonstrated previously in two Phase III trials.

Elevated body temperature during the relapsing-remitting stage may reflect disease-related inflammatory processes that characterize RRMS, in contrast to the relative paucity of inflammatory events seen in SPMS.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> Here, we aim to replicate our finding of elevated body temperature in RRMS compared to SPMS in a large, multi-center sample. This would support elevated core body temperature as an indication of inflammatory processes taking place in persons with RRMS, whereas we expect SPMS to have lower body temperature, given that disease-related inflammatory processes have abated in this disease stage.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Participants were 98 RRMS patients and 35 SPMS patients. Core body temperature was measured with an infrared aural thermometer (Braun ThermoScan IRT 4520). RRMS group was composed of 34% male, 66% female. SPMS group was 46% male/54% female.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The RRMS group had higher core body temperature than the SPMS group (p=.008). Body temperature for the RRMS group was 36.96&#x000b0;C&#x000b1;0.35, and for the SPMS group was 36.77&#x000b0;C &#x000b1;0.38. This difference remained significant after controlling for age, sex, and recruitment center (p=.050).All effect sizes were considered medium.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Body temperature differences between RRMS and SPMS has now been shown in a large, multi-center sample comprising data from two countries. Core body temperature is an easily obtained metric that may hold important implications regarding disease-related inflammatory processes. Moreover, the decreased body temperature in SPMS observed here may signify the abatement of inflammatory processes during this disease stage.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section898-1352458514547846"><title>P931</title><sec id="section899-1352458514547846"><title>Case report: a patient with residual cognitive sequelae after post-malaria acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis (ADEM)</title><p>LY Cheng<sup>1</sup>, TI de Silva<sup>2</sup>, ST Green<sup>3</sup>, <underline>B Sharrack</underline><sup>4</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>University of Sheffield, Medical School, Sheffield, United Kingdom, <sup>2</sup>Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Royal Hallamshire Hospital, Academic Unit of Immunology and Infectious Diseases, Department of Infection and Immunity, Sheffield, United Kingdom, <sup>3</sup>Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Royal Hallamshire Hospital, Department of Infection and Tropical Medicine, Sheffield, United Kingdom, <sup>4</sup>Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Royal Hallamshire Hospital, Department of Neurology, Sheffield, United Kingdom</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> ADEM is an acute monophasic inflammatory encephalopathy, often precipitated by viral infections and vaccinations.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> We report a case of severe ADEM two months after a malaria infection, resulting in significant cognitive sequelae.

MEPs were recorded from Abductor Hallucis of both legs. Changes in DTI parameters, i.e. Fractional Anisotropy (FA), Axial, Mean, and Radial Diffusivities (AD,MD,RD), were investigated with Tract-Based-Spatial-Statistics (TBSS); DTI results were corrected for multiple comparisons by threshold-free cluster enhancement (p&#x0003c; 0.05). Wilcoxon test was used for statistical analysis. Pts were clinical responders (CR) when T25FWT decreased by &#x0003e;=20%. MEPs were scored assigning 1 point for each abnormal value in Central Motor Conduction Time (CMCT) and/or mean Amplitude (Amp) in either side <sup>(1)</sup> and pts classified as neurophysiological responders (NPR) when the score improved.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> We enrolled 20 pts, median EDSS 5.75 (range 4.0-6.5).

Whole WM TBSS analysis revealed MD and RD reduction (p&#x0003c; 0.05) in corticospinal tracts (CST), not confirmed by a Wilcoxon test on mean values of DTI metrics in CST. 10 pts were classified as CR and 10 as NPR.

The effect of 4-AP on demyelinated axons can explain the improvement in MEPs in our pts. Since the increase of RD values is usually considered a measure of myelin loss, its slight but significant reduction after treatment may suggest an early amelioration in water molecules motion on which a potential 4-AP role has to be further investigated.</p><list list-type="order" id="list20-1352458514547846"><list-item><p>Ruck T et al.

Two patients (50%) developed contralateral hemiparesis and spasticity after the procedure which required physical therapy.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Radiosurgical thalamotomy is a palliative measure that can be useful in patients with highly-disabling tremor due to MS.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section912-1352458514547846"><title>P938</title><sec id="section913-1352458514547846"><title>Impact of bladder symptoms on quality of life in multiple sclerosis</title><p><underline>K Abdel-Aziz</underline><sup>1</sup>, C Young<sup>2</sup>, AJ Thompson<sup>1,3</sup>, O Ciccarelli<sup>1,3</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>NMR Research Unit, Queen Square MS Centre, UCL Institute of Neurology, London, United Kingdom, <sup>2</sup>Walton Centre NHS Foundation trust, Liverpool, United Kingdom, <sup>3</sup>NIHR University College London Hospitals Biomedical Research Centre, London, United Kingdom</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Neurogenic bladder dysfunction is a common feature of multiple sclerosis (MS) but the effect of bladder dysfunction on quality of life in MS remains under-reported. The King&#x02019;s Health Questionnaire (KHQ) is well validated for the assessment of bladder symptoms and their effect on quality of life (QOL). The KHQ contains 2 single item questions addressing general health perception and impact of bladder symptoms; six multi-item QOL domains covering role limitation, physical limitation, social limitation, personal relationships, emotions and sleep/energy. Two further domains score symptom severity and frequency.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> In this prospective observational study we aimed to apply the KHQ to assess the impact of bladder symptoms on the QOL of patients with MS.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> .41 patients with MS (20 relapsing MS, 21 primary progressive MS) with a mean age of 44.4 (SD 9.4) years (26F, 15M) and a mean disease duration of 6.0 (SD 5.7) years were recruited from a tertiary MS clinic. Patients were clinically evaluated with the Expanded Disability Severity Score (EDSS) and the KHQ. A one sample t-test was used to assess the impact of bladder symptoms on each of the six QOL domains within the KHQ. Linear regression models were used to examine relationships between QOL scores and symptom severity and frequency, when adjusting for age, gender and EDSS.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> 37 of 41 patients (90%) experienced some form of bladder symptom when directly questioned. Bladder symptoms negatively impacted on performance of normal roles (P &#x0003c; 0.001), physical function (P &#x0003c; 0.001), social interactions (P &#x0003c; 0.001), personal relationships (P = 0.007), emotions (P&#x0003c; 0.001) and sleep quality (P&#x0003c; 0.001). When correcting for age, gender and EDSS, symptom severity predicted QOL scores in the emotions (standardised regression coefficient (&#x003b2;) = 0.37, P= 0.04), personal relationships (&#x003b2;=0.53, P=0.04), social functioning (&#x003b2;=0.71, P&#x0003c; 0.001) and physical (&#x003b2;= 0.46, P=0.004) domains. Symptom frequency predicted scores in the emotions (&#x003b2;= 0.42, P=0.02), sleep (&#x003b2;= 0.68, P&#x0003c; 0.001), physical (&#x003b2;=0.38, P=0.02), and role limitation (&#x003b2;=0.54, P=0.002) domains.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Bladder symptoms in MS are common and affect QOL, independently of age, gender and global disability. Bladder symptoms in MS are often amenable to treatment; early recognition of symptoms, leading to early treatment could therefore have a positive impact on patients&#x02019; QOL.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section914-1352458514547846"><title>P939</title><sec id="section915-1352458514547846"><title>Sustained</title><p><bold>release fampridine treatment impacts on the daily physical activity amount in MS people with walking disability</bold></p><p><underline>P Mulero</underline><sup>1</sup>, MJ Neri<sup>1</sup>, N Redondo<sup>1</sup>, P Calle<sup>1</sup>, MF Mu&#x000f1;oz<sup>2</sup>, AB Mu&#x000f1;oz<sup>3</sup>, JF Arenillas<sup>1</sup>, N T&#x000e9;llez<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Hospital Cl&#x000ed;nico Universitario de Valladolid, Neurology, Valladolid, Spain, <sup>2</sup>Hospital Cl&#x000ed;nico Universitario de Valladolid, Research Support Unit, Valladolid, Spain, <sup>3</sup>Hospital Cl&#x000ed;nico Universitario de Valladolid, Hospital Pharmacy, Valladolid, Spain</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Sustained-release fampridine (fampridine-SR) is the first drug approved for the improvement of walking in adult MS patients with walking disability (EDSS 4-7). Efficacy is defined according to the percentage of change in walking speed by the Timed 25-Foot Walk (T25FW). Speed improvements of &#x02265;20% are associated with clinically significant changes in self-reported walking ability, using the MSWS-12 score. Nonetheless, the impact of the drug on real daily physical activity has not been evaluated.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of fampridine-SR on the daily physical activity amount.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Patients with a diagnosis of MS, with EDSS between 4 and 7 were proposed to initiate treatment with fampridine-SR (10 mg twice daily). Physical activity was measured using the International Physical Activity Questionary (IPAQ&#x02122;) which splits patients in 3 categories according to the amount of physical activity (low, moderate and high). T25FW, MSWS-12 and IPAQ<sup>TM</sup> were measured at baseline, before starting treatment, and 2 weeks later.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Forty-four patients (70.5% female; mean [SD] age, 51 [9.7] years) have been included at the time of the abstract elaboration. Two patients dropped out the study. Thirty four patients (80.9%) were considered responders to fampridine-SR (mean percent change in T25FWT: 30.6%; range: 20%-50.8%). At baseline, the physical activity amount was low in 25 patients (59.5%) and moderate in 17 (40.5%). After 2 weeks on fampridine-SR, physical activity was low in 19 patients (45,3%), moderate in 22 (52,3%) and 1 (2,4%) patient achieved a high level on IPAQ<sup>TM</sup> score. Statiscally significant differences in scale IPAQ before and after treatment were found in the responder group (p-value=0.005) but not in non-responders (p=0.317).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Increasing the speed walking in MS people seems to impact on the amount of total daily physical activity.

Both may occur even at the earliest stage of the disease. Balance depends on the integration of the somatosensory, vestibular and visual information in the central nervous systems (CNS). Central sensory integration is an essential component of effective balance. Fatigue in MS is also associated with central sensory integration deficit.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> Our objective was to investigate if balance disorders and fatigue are related to the central sensory integration dysfunction.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> We evaluated 44 MS consecutive outpatients with relapsing-remitting disease. We measured balance by modified Sensory Organization Test (mSOT) in the dynamic posturography, Pro Balance Master (NeuroCom). This test provides information about the integration of the proprioceptive, visual and vestibular systems. It consists of four sensorial conditions: eyes open or closed with stable or unstable surface. The sway of patients during the test was converted into a percentage value called Composite Equilibrium score (CE).The CE is calculated based on the weighted average of the percentage for each condition and represents the function of central sensory integration. Fatigue symptom was measured by Fatigue Status Scale (FSS). Statistical analysis was performed by the Spearman correlation test, continuous data was shown by mean (SD) and non continuous data by median (range).</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The median EDSS score was 1 (0 - 4.5) and FSS score was 4.6 (1 - 7.5). The CE score was 72(&#x000b1;11.2). A low correlation was found between FSS and CE (rs= &#x02212;0.407, p=0.006). We also found a low correlation between FSS and each sensorial condition: C1 (rs= &#x02212;0.376, p &#x0003c; 0.05), C2 (rs= &#x02212;0.364, p&#x0003c; 0.05) and C4 (rs= &#x02212;0.371, p&#x0003c; 0.05). There was no correlation between FSS and C3 (rs= &#x02212;0.296, p= 0.05).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Balance disorders and fatigue had a weak correlation in this study. Our patients showed poor performance in SOT test and important fatigue symptom. Both are related to central sensory integration dysfunction, but most likely in different areas in CNS. Previous studies showed a correlation between imbalance and fatigue when brainstem and cerebellar regions were impaired. The lack of correlation could be explained by the fact that neither of our patients presented dizziness nor cerebellar symptom. We concluded that balance disorders and fatigue are associated with impaired in different sensory integration areas in CNS.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section918-1352458514547846"><title>P941</title><sec id="section919-1352458514547846"><title>Effects of long-term treatment with prolonged-release fampridine on cognitive functioning in patients with multiple sclerosis</title><p>SD Broicher<sup>1</sup>, O Geisseler<sup>1</sup>, N Germann<sup>1</sup>, P Brugger<sup>1</sup>, <underline>M Linnebank</underline><sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>University Hospital Zurich, Department of Neurology, Zurich, Switzerland</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Non-pharmacological interventions, such as ergotherapy, psychotherapy and cognitive rehabilitation may at least transiently improve cognition, but probably do not prevent the long-term decline of cognitive functions in subjects with multiple sclerosis (MS). In FAMPKIN, the original study of the EXTENSION described here, we found that treatment with prolonged-release fampridine (4-aminopyridine), a potassium-channel blocker, is associated with improvements in walking function, as well as fatigue. Despite increasing awareness of cognitive dysfunction in MS patients, past efforts to develop treatments for cognitive impairment in MS have largely been minimal or ineffective.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> The aim of the present neuropsychological part of FAMPKIN EXTENSION is to study neuropsychological functions in patients with MS under fampridine therapy.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> 32 MS subjects of FAMPKIN EXTENSION were included and received continuous and unblinded treatment with fampridin PR (twice a day with 10mg) for 11.5 months. Cognitive functioning was assessed 2 times within one year using an established neuropsychological test battery as well as questionnaires to examine depression and fatigue. Tests were administered during continuous treatment with prolonged-release fampridine (V2), and within a 2 week treatment-free interval (V3). Changes between V2 and V3 were evaluated using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> There was a statistically significant difference in test-retest <italic>z</italic> scores for four of six target cognitive measures assessing attention (tonic alertness: V2: <italic>Mdn</italic>=264.50, V3: <italic>Mdn</italic>=271.50, <italic>z</italic>=&#x02212;2.23, <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c; 0.05; selective attention, errors: V2: <italic>Mdn</italic>=1.00, V3: <italic>Mdn</italic>=0.00, <italic>z</italic>= &#x02212;2.88, <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c; 0.01), psychomotor speed (Digit Symbol: V2: <italic>Mdn</italic>=43.00, V3: <italic>Mdn</italic>=49.50, <italic>z</italic>=&#x02212;2.42, <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c; 0.05) and executive function (design fluency: V2: <italic>Mdn</italic>=18.50, V3: <italic>Mdn</italic>=13.00, <italic>z</italic>=&#x02212;2.80, <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c; 0.05), always indicating better test performance under fampridine therapy.

The current formulation was developed to overcome this and improve clinical application of &#x00394;<sup>9</sup>-THC in the treatment of spasticity and pain in MS.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> The aim of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy of a novel oral formulation of &#x00394;<sup>9</sup>-THC (ECP002A) to treat spasticity, pain and improve functional outcome measures in 24 patients with primary or secondary progressive MS.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> This was a two-phase study consisting of a dose-finding phase utilizing pharmacokinetic- pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) modeling and a treatment phase. In the dose-finding phase, the effect of an escalating oral dose of ECP002A on pharmacodynamic outcome variables was assessed in a randomized placebo-controlled, two-way cross-over trial design. Patients visited the outpatient clinic on two occasions and received an escalating oral dose of ECP002A or placebo. Plasma concentrations of &#x00394;<sup>9</sup>-THC and metabolites were measured to generate an individual treatment regimen based on PK and PD. In the 4-week treatment phase, the individual dose was administered three times daily in a randomized placebo-controlled, parallel fashion. During the treatment phase muscle spasticity (Ashworth and subjective spasticity), pain and clinical outcomes (e.g. EDSS, 25Ft Timed walk, GNDS) were measured at baseline, week 2 and 4.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Pain was significantly reduced when measured directly after administration of ECP002A in the clinic, but not when measured in a daily diary. A similar pattern was observed in subjective muscle spasticity. Other clinical outcomes were not significantly different between active treatment and placebo.

While an interim analysis does not demonstrate any association between testosterone and MSRF, recruitment is ongoing and final results will be available in September 2014. Analysis of the completed dataset will determine if low or low-normal testosterone levels are associated with fatigue or any other demographic or clinical features of MS. If hypogonadism is common in MS this might reflect an unappreciated important comorbidity and/or another cause of fatigue or reflect a neuroendocrine manifestation of MS itself.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section928-1352458514547846"><title>P946</title><sec id="section929-1352458514547846"><title>Urinary dysfunction in multiple sclerosis; frequency, characteristics and management in standard care</title><p><underline>L Wdowiak</underline><sup>1</sup>, A Al Khedr<sup>1</sup>, F Saint<sup>2</sup>, O Godefroy<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>CHU Amiens, Neurology, Amiens, France, <sup>2</sup>CHU Amiens, Urology and Transplant, Amiens, France</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most frequent central nervous system demyelinating disease which affects young people, mostly women.

It is widely acknowledged that pain has a significant impact on health-related quality of life in MS patients. Prevalence estimates for any pain syndrome, however, vary substantially - from 26% to over 80%. It remains unclear if prevalence increases with worsening disability and duration of MS. Such variability is in part attributable to the lack of systematic classification for pain syndromes - studies include a wide variety of pain categories (i.e. neuropathic, inflammatory, nociceptive, mixed, psychogenic, etc.). Mechanisms of pain in MS are complex and poorly understood, but new diagnostic procedures including quantitative sensory testing and pain-related evoked potentials may lead to better characterization and classification of central pain in MS. Although a variety of pain medications are used to treat pain in MS, evidence-based recommendations are lacking as there are only a handful of small randomized controlled studies for treatment of central pain syndromes in MS.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Central pain syndromes are common and significantly reduce quality of life in MS patients. A comprehensive, widely accepted classification of pain syndromes analogous to the International Classification of Headache Disorders would advance epidemiologic studies in the field. There remains a significant need for well-designed studies to clarify the mechanisms, comorbidities, and treatment of central pain in the MS population.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section932-1352458514547846"><title>P948</title><sec id="section933-1352458514547846"><title>Increased arrhythmic incidence in multiple sclerosis is associated with the location of the demyelinating plaques in the spinal cord</title><p><underline>K Kilintireas</underline><sup>1</sup>, E Giallafos<sup>1</sup>, V Haina<sup>1</sup>, S Gerakoulis<sup>1</sup>, M Panagiotou<sup>1</sup>, E Evaggelopoulou<sup>1</sup>, G Koutsis<sup>1</sup>, M Anagnostouli<sup>1</sup>, E Stampoulis<sup>1</sup>, E Andreadou<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>University of Athens, 1st Department of Neurology, Athens, Greece</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Arrhythmias have been linked with mortality and morbidity in Multiple Sclerosis (MS). However very few data exist concerning the incidence of serious arrhythmias in MS.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> Aim of this study was the detection of the arrhythmic burden in MS.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> We enrolled 108 consecutive patients that fulfilled the 2005 revised McDonald criteria for MS. Age at disease onset, disease duration, disease subtype, medication and EDSS score at the time of examination were recorded. MRI and CSF data were collected. Cardiac ultrasound, 24hour-ambulatory ECG recording (Holter), electrocardiography and clinical examination were performed to identify patients with arrhythmia. Ventricular arrhythmias were classified according to Lown criteria; classes 3 and above were classified as complex ventricular arrhythmias (CVA). Patients with history of arrhythmias, use of antiarrhythmics or implanted pacemaker or defibrillator were excluded.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Mean age of the patients was 42.3&#x000b1;9.5 years and 46 (42,59%) males; 65 patients (60,19%) had a Relapsing-Remitting type of MS, 5 (4,63%) had a Primary Progressive type while the rest 38(35.18%) had Seconary Progressive MS. Mean disease duration was 12&#x000b1;13 years and mean EDSS score was 2.5 &#x000b1; 1.5. All patients had normal echo findings with ejection fraction 59.4&#x000b1;7.5% and no wall abnormalities. 22 patients (20,37%) had abnormal holter with 8 (7,4%) patients having atrioventricular block and 14 (12,96%) had CVA. Premature ventricular beats were detected in 76 (70,37%) patients, of whom 14(12,96%) were classified as CVA 3 having non sustained ventricular tachycardia. A common finding of the abnormal holter patients was the presence of demyelinating lesions in the lower cervical (C5-7) and upper thoracic (Th1-4) spinal cord. No differences were observed in type of MS, disease duration, EDSS and treatment approaches.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our study shows a high incidence of arrhythmias in the MS population. This finding might be due to the presence of lesions in lower cervical and upper thoracic spinal cord possibly interfering with ANS function. Our findings might have implications for treatment strategies and help to distinguish patients at higher risk.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="section934-1352458514547846"><title>Treatment biomarkers, pharmacology, and MOA</title><sec id="section935-1352458514547846"><title>P949</title><sec id="section936-1352458514547846"><title>Natalizumab-induced circulating hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) have higher expansion capacity in MS patients who show significantly increased HSC count</title><p><underline>M Mattoscio</underline><sup>1</sup>, B Mazzanti<sup>2</sup>, R Nicholas<sup>1</sup>, O Malik<sup>3</sup>, R Saccardi<sup>2</sup>, P Muraro<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Imperial College, Medicine, Division of Brain Sciences, London, United Kingdom, <sup>2</sup>University of Florence, Careggi Hospital, Cord Blood Bank, Florence, Italy, <sup>3</sup>Imperial College London NHS Trust, Medicine, Division of Brain Sciences, London, United Kingdom</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> We have previously shown that different HSC mobilization responses among natalizumab-treated MS patients are associated with differential clinical response to the treatment.

Treg deficiency, instability and dysfunction are implicated in the pathogenesis of numerous autoimmune diseases, including relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). Daclizumab HYP (DAC HYP) is a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds the IL-2 receptor alpha chain (CD25) and prevents its association with IL-2. DAC HYP inhibits high affinity IL-2R&#x003b1;-dependent IL-2 signaling while leaving intermediate affinity IL-2R&#x003b2;&#x003b3;-signaling intact. DAC HYP has demonstrated clinical efficacy in patients with RRMS.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To determine the <italic>in vivo</italic> impact of CD25 blockade on the phenotype and stability of human Tregs, and to evaluate associations between circulating Tregs and treatment response or adverse events in DAC HYP-treated RRMS patients.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Tregs from DAC HYP- and placebo-treated RRMS patients from the SELECT phase II clinical trial were analyzed at baseline and post-treatment over the 52-week study. Phenotypic and functional properties were measured using flow cytometry. Lineage stability was assessed by epigenetic analysis of the <italic>FOXP3</italic> promoter. IL-2 signaling was quantitated using STAT5 PhosFlow. Associations between Treg measurements and treatment response or cutaneous adverse events were determined by a negative binomial model and Wilcoxon Rank-sum test, respectively.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Tregs in placebo-treated RRMS patients remained stable over the 52-week study. DAC HYP-treated patients had a 45.8% decline in activated Tregs and a 29.7% decline in resting Tregs. Tregs in DAC HYP-treated patients retained a demethylated <italic>TSDR</italic> in the <italic>FOXP3</italic> promoter, maintained active cell cycling and had minimal production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-2, IFN-&#x003b3;, and IL-17. In the presence of DAC HYP, IL-2 serum concentrations increased and IL-2R&#x003b2;&#x003b3; signaling induced STAT5 phosphorylation and sustained FoxP3 expression. No associations were observed between circulating Treg numbers and treatment response or adverse events.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> FoxP3-expressing cells maintained during DAC HYP treatment retain phenotypic and functional characteristics of Tregs. Increased serum IL-2 and IL-2 signaling via the intermediate affinity IL-2R&#x003b2;&#x003b3; in Tregs contributes to Treg maintenance. These data suggest that Treg lineage stability can be maintained in the face of CD25 blockade and that DAC HYP-treated patients retain a population of functional Tregs.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section939-1352458514547846"><title>P951</title><sec id="section940-1352458514547846"><title>Pharmacogenomics of interferon-beta treatment in Caucasian MS patients</title><p>S Mahurkar<sup>1</sup>, V Suppiah<sup>1</sup>, M Moldovan<sup>2</sup>, M Slee<sup>3</sup>, M Krupa<sup>3</sup>, H Butzkueven<sup>4</sup>, V Jokubaitis<sup>4</sup>, B Taylor<sup>5</sup>, A Kermode<sup>6</sup>, S Broadley<sup>7</sup>, G Stewart<sup>8</sup>, D Booth<sup>8</sup>, F McKay<sup>8</sup>, J Lechner-Scott<sup>9</sup>, F Martinelli Boneschi<sup>10</sup>, K Vandenbroeck<sup>11</sup>, A Antig&#x000fc;edad<sup>12</sup>, M Comabella<sup>13</sup>, S Malhotra<sup>13</sup>, X Montalban<sup>13</sup>, <underline>C O&#x02019;Doherty</underline><sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>University of South Australia, School of Pharmacy and Medical Sciences, Adelaide, Australia, <sup>2</sup>University of South Australia, School of Population Health, Adelaide, Australia, <sup>3</sup>Flinders University and Medical Centre, Adelaide, Australia, <sup>4</sup>University of Melbourne, Department of Medicine, Melbourne Brain Centre, Melbourne, Australia, <sup>5</sup>University of Tasmania, Menzies Research Institute, Hobart, Australia, <sup>6</sup>University of Western Australia, Centre for Neuromuscular and Neurological Disorders, Perth, Australia, <sup>7</sup>Griffith University, School of Medicine, Meadowbrook, Australia, <sup>8</sup>University of Sydney, Westmead Millennium Institute, Sydney, Australia, <sup>9</sup>University of Newcastle, Department of Neurology, John Hunter Hospital, Callaghan, Australia, <sup>10</sup>Scientific Institute San Raffaele, Department of Neurology and Laboratory of Neurogenetics of complex disease Institute of Experimental Neurology, San Raffaele, Italy, <sup>11</sup>University of the Basque Country, Neurogenomiks Laboratory, University of the Basque Country &#x00026; IKERBASQUE, Basque Foundation for Science, Bilbao, Spain, <sup>12</sup>Hospital de Basurto, Servicio de Neurolog&#x000ed;a, Bilbao, Spain, <sup>13</sup>Universitat Aut&#x000f2;noma de Barcelona, Servei de Neurologia-Neuroimmunologia.

Current first-line DMDs include 3 interferon-beta (IFN&#x003b2;) products. While these agents have been shown to be effective, up to half of treated patients do not respond well to these treatments and determination of response status requires clinical follow-up of 1-2 years. This may lead to prolonged patient suffering and delays the administration of other effective treatments in non-responsive patients. Hence it is imperative to identify biomarkers that can predict the outcome of IFN&#x003b2; treatment prior to the initiation of therapy for MS management.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> This project aims to identify genetic biomarkers associated with response to IFN&#x003b2; treatment.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> To explore the genetic variants associated with interindividual response variability to IFN&#x003b2; treatment we conducted a two-stage GWAS. In the discovery stage, Australian MS patients from the Australia &#x00026; New Zealand Multiple Sclerosis Genetics Consortium (ANZgene) and Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium 2 (WTCCC2) were used to identify responders (R) &#x00026; non-responders (NRs) to IFN&#x003b2; treatment by applying extreme phenotype criteria in patients followed up for 2 years (R: No relapse &#x00026; no change in EDSS.

Possible cryptic relatedness or population stratification among the subjects were evaluated using PLINK and EIGENSTRAT respectively.</p><p>Discovery stage analysis was performed on a total of 284,577 SNPs obtained from 127 Australian IFN&#x003b2; treated patients (R=51 &#x00026; NR=76). Prioritization of SNPs for the validation stage was based on P values generated by combination of efficiency robust statistical testing strategies such as MAX4 and proportional odds model. P values were also corrected to account for variable baseline covariates.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> 339 statistically significant SNPs from the discovery stage were selected for replication in the validation cohort comprising of 479 IFN&#x003b2; treated MS patients (R=273 &#x00026; NR=206) from Australia, Italy &#x00026; Spain.

The influence of Fingolimod treatment on B cell subsets of multiple sclerosis patients and its potential clinical relevance have not been evaluated, so far.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> The aim of our study was to evaluate the impact of Fingolimod treatment on B cell subset composition in the periphery and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and B cell functions such as cytokine production and migratory capacity.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> We analyzed B cell subset composition and cytokine production of B cells derived from peripheral blood mononuclear cells from multiple sclerosis patients under Fingolimod treatment in comparison to untreated multiple sclerosis patients and healthy controls, by flow cytometry and ELISA. Further, lymphocyte migration across primary human brain microvascular endothelial cells was evaluated in an <italic>in vitro</italic> transmigration assay under homeostatic as well as under inflammatory conditions, and B cell subsets were evaluated in CSF and peripheral blood by flow cytometry. Finally, regulatory B cell frequencies were correlated with parameters of disease stability.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Within the peripheral B cell compartment of Fingolimod-treated patients, the proportion of regulatory B cells (CD38<sup>+</sup> CD27<sup>-</sup> CD24<sup>+</sup> CD5<sup>+</sup>) was significantly increased when compared to treatment-na&#x000ef;ve multiple sclerosis patients and to healthy controls, and significantly more regulatory B cells produced Interleukin-10. Fingolimod treatment enhanced the capacity of regulatory B cells to transmigrate across brain endothelial cells in an <italic>in-vitro</italic> model of the blood-brain-barrier. In line with this, the CSF/blood ratio of total B cells and regulatory B cells was strongly increased by Fingolimod treatment, and patients exhibited increased regulatory B cell frequencies in the CSF. Finally, elevated regulatory B cell frequencies in the periphery significantly correlated with clinical and paraclinical disease stability, thus pointing to a functional relevance of regulatory B cells under Fingolimod treatment.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Taken together, these data point to a novel and as yet unrecognized role of Fingolimod in correction of impaired B cell functions in multiple sclerosis by enhancing regulatory B cells.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section943-1352458514547846"><title>P953</title><sec id="section944-1352458514547846"><title>Vitamin D3 administration to MS patients leads to increased serum levels of TGF-beta</title><p><underline>J &#x000c5;ivo</underline><sup>1</sup>, A H&#x000e4;nninen<sup>2</sup>, J Ilonen<sup>3</sup>, M Soilu-H&#x000e4;nninen<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Turku University Hospital, Neurology, Turku, Finland, <sup>2</sup>University of Turku, Department of Clinical Microbiology and Immunology, Turku, Finland, <sup>3</sup>University of Turku, Immunogenetics Laboratory, Turku, Finland</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Vitamin D is an environmental risk factor for MS.

In a previous Phase 2, randomized, placebo and active-controlled, multi-center trial in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS), the number of gadolinium-enhancing (Gd+) lesions and annualized relapse rates were significantly reduced with OCR. OCR is currently in Phase 3 clinical development for relapsing MS (RMS) and primary progressive MS (PPMS).</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To determine the kinetics of B-cell reduction and reconstitution in cynomolgus monkey peripheral blood and lymphoid tissues following intravenous (IV) administration of one or two cycles of OCR.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> OCR was administered to cynomolgus monkeys at doses of 0, 10, 50 and 100 mg/kg over one or two treatment cycles. Cycle 1 consisted of two IV infusions given two weeks apart. Following a 14 week observation period, a subset of cohorts were given a retreatment cycle (cycle 2) consisting of two IV infusions administered two weeks apart. Peripheral blood B-cells were periodically monitored by flow cytometry throughout the study. At two necropsy time points, B-cells from select lymphoid tissues were quantified by flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry (IHC).</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Following cycle 1, peripheral blood B-cells (CD3-CD40+) were rapidly suppressed to undetectable levels for all cohorts with repopulation beginning at week 6 (10 mg/kg) and week 14 (50 and 100 mg/kg). Following the 2nd cycle there was near complete B-cell recovery by week 43. At 100 mg/kg, the rate of B-cell recovery was similar for cohorts receiving either one or two cycles. At week 20 (2 weeks after cycle 2), there was a consistent reduction of B-cells in spleen, lymph nodes (LN) and Peyer&#x02019;s patches as measured by ICH with reduction most prominent in spleen. By the study termination (week 43), repopulation of lymphoid B-cells was similar to controls. By flow cytometry, mean lymphoid tissue B-cells at week 20 were reduced to 55/52% (bone marrow), 0.5/0.8 % (spleen), and 3/3% (LN) relative to controls at the 50/100 mg/kg doses. Upon recovery (week 43), values were comparable to controls.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Ocrelizumab induced a rapid depletion in blood B-cells in cynomolgus monkeys, but only partial depletion in lymphoid tissue B-cells following two cycles of administration. The effects were reversible and following either one or two cycles, the rate of peripheral blood B-cell reconstitution was similar.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section947-1352458514547846"><title>P955</title><sec id="section948-1352458514547846"><title>Laquinimod reduces CNS autoimmunity by activation of natural killer cells</title><p><underline>M Ott</underline><sup>1</sup>, C Wegner<sup>1</sup>, L Hayardeny<sup>2</sup>, E Ullrich<sup>3</sup>, W Br&#x000fc;ck<sup>1</sup>, S Nessler<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>University Medical Center Goettingen, Department of Neuropathology, Goettingen, Germany, <sup>2</sup>Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., Netanya, Israel, <sup>3</sup>Johann Wolfgang Goethe-University, LOEWE Center for Cell and Gene Therapy, Frankfurt/Main, Germany</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Laquinimod, a new orally active immunomodulator, is currently under investigation for the treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS). In previous clinical trials laquinimod considerably reduced the annualized relapse rate, disability progression and brain atrophy in MS patients. Experimental data provided evidence for immunomodulatory effects of LAQ on innate and adaptive immune cells. As such, LAQ reduced the immunogenicity of dendritic cells (DCs) and induced type II myeloid cells. Since recent immunological studies emphasized a strong crosstalk between DCs and natural killer cells (NKs), we analyzed whether LAQ modulates NK cell responses.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> This study investigated the effects of laquinimod on NK cell phenotypes in MOG<sub>35-55</sub> immunized C57BL/6 mice.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> We characterized activating and inhibitory receptors on NK cells in LAQ-treated, MOG<sub>35-55</sub> immunized animals by flow cytometry. Functional studies (cytotoxicity, cytokine production, inhibition of T cell proliferation) were performed with ex vivo purified NK cells from MOG<sub>35-55</sub> immunized and LAQ-treated mice. Treatment efficacy of LAQ was analyzed in EAE animals depleted of NK cells by PK136 antibody administration.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> LAQ increased the frequency of CD69+ NK cells (p &#x0003c; 0.001) and upregulated the expression of the activating receptors TACTILE (p &#x0003c; 0.001), DNAM-1 (p&#x0003c; 0.01) and NKG2D (p &#x0003c; 0.001) specifically on NK cells. Additionally, LAQ improved classical NK cell effector functions, as NK cells derived from LAQ-treated mice killed B16F10 melanoma cells <italic>in vitro</italic> more efficiently than NK cells derived from vehicle controls (p&#x0003c; 0.05). In addition, they produced more IFN&#x003b3; in response to IL-12 and IL-18 stimulation (p&#x0003c; 0.05). In a triple co-culture system with 2D2 T cells and bone marrow derived DCs, NK cells derived from LAQ-treated mice significantly inhibited T cell proliferation in response to MOG<sub>35-55</sub> (p&#x0003c; 0.05). Depletion of NK cells in vivo did not change the LAQ-induced reduction of DCs (CD11c<sup>high</sup> MHCII<sup>+</sup>) in the spleen but impaired the efficacy to suppress EAE.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Treatment with LAQ induced NK cell activation, which contributes to the efficacy of LAQ to suppress CNS autoimmunity.

Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting (FACS) analysis of Treg, Thelper (Th)1 and Th17 cells. Immunological molecule mRNA levels (chemokines:CCL-11,CXCL-10;chemokine receptors:CCR-4,CCR-6; cytokines:IFN&#x003b3;,TGF&#x003b2;,TNF&#x003b1;,IL-1&#x003b2;,IL-2,IL-6,IL-10,IL-12p35,IL-17A,IL-17F,IL22,IL-23,IL-26,IL-27;and T-bet,ROR&#x003b3;t,Foxp3) quantified by TaqMan&#x000ae; low density array (TLDA) real-time polymerase chain reaction in whole blood. Treg suppressor activity assessed at M12 and M24 by ELISPOT on peripheral blood mononucleate cells (PBMC) depleted of CD25high T cells and activated with myelin basic protein (MBP) or anti-CD3-CD28. Timepoints: Baseline (before first alemtuzumab course);Month (M) 6, M12, M18, M24: respectively 6,12,18, 24 months after the first course. M12 was before second alemtuzumab course. The relative mean difference between baseline and subsequent timepoints estimated through the formula: (Timepoint-Baseline)/Baseline, and significance of the differences tested.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Twenty-nine patients from 6 European sites. After alemtuzumab, CD4+ lymphocytes decreased from 45 to 14%.Th17 increased at M18; no significant variation were observed in Th1 cells. T-bet and IL-23 decreased; Foxp3, TGF&#x003b2;, IL-10 and IL-27 increased from M6 to M24. Treg cell specific suppressive function on MBP auto-reactive Th1 and Th17 cell increased only at M24, whereas the number of Treg cells and their overall suppressor function did not significantly change during the follow-up. Six relapses were observed in 5 patients. No occurrence of severe autoimmune diseases or dysthyroidism.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The overall alemtuzumab-induced CD4+ lymphocyte depletion might relate to the reduction of MS disease activity. The increase of suppressor cytokines IL-27,IL-10,TGF&#x003b2; and of MBP-specific Treg suppressor function could have resulted in the decrease of T-bet, modulating the anti-CNS pathogenicity of Th1 and Th17 cells. The further 2 year long-term follow-up could provide information on the timing of subsequent courses of alemtuzumab in individual patients.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section951-1352458514547846"><title>P957</title><sec id="section952-1352458514547846"><title>Fingolimod selectively affect antigen-presenting cells ex vivo and in vitro in multiple sclerosis</title><p><underline>K Thomas</underline><sup>1</sup>, U Hainke<sup>1</sup>, T Sehr<sup>1</sup>, T Schulthei&#x000df;<sup>1</sup>, T Ziemssen<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>University Hospital Dresden, Center of Clinical Neuroscience, Dresden, Germany</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Fingolimod (FTY) is known as S1P receptor analog that mediates inhibition of lymphocyte egress from lymph nodes into peripheral blood. Beside these effects also directed modulation of immune cell populations is discussed. Dendritic cells (DC) and monocytes (Mo) are professional antigen presenting cells (APC) orchestrating relevant processes of innate immunity and suggested to be directly involved in multiple sclerosis (MS) pathogenesis. The most frequent proinflammatory human blood DC is the so-called slanDC. It is assumed that immunomodulatory MS treatment strategies including FTY evoke indirect effects on T and B cell populations by specific modulation of APC function.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To evaluate effects of FTY on the innate immune system in MS.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> As ex vivo project, blood was drawn from MS patients before and during FTY therapy. T cells, B cells, NK cells, slanDC, CD1+DC and Mo were analyzed by FACS at different timepoints. As detailed <italic>ex vivo-in vitro</italic> project, slanDC, CD1+DC and Mo were isolated by immunomagnetic cell sorting of healthy controls (HC) and FTY treated MS patients. After stimulation with TLR-2/4 ligands in presence or absence of FTY or FTY-phosphate (FTY-P), APC were analyzed regarding cytokine release, expression of surface markers, phagocytosis activity and capacity to promote proliferation and differentiation of T-cells.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> In ex vivo analysis cell number of CD4, CD8 and CD19 lymphocytes decreased after treatment initiation, whereas slanDC, CD1+DC and Mo kept stable during 24 month follow up. FTY and FTY-P decreased proinflammatory cytokine release of IL-6, IL-1b and TNF-a in slanDC, CD1+DC and Mo after LPS or PGN stimulation. Compared to HC, slanDC of FTY treated patients showed a decreased IL-6 and IL-1b secretion after LPS, but an increased IL-10 secretion. Expression of surface maturation and activation markers including CD83 and CD86 were down regulated in slanDC and CD1+DC after FTY challenge. FTY but not FTY-P pre-treatment inhibited slanDC and CD1+DC depending CD4 and CD8 T cell proliferation. FTY and FTY-P reduced the ability of LPS-stimulated slanDC and CD1+DC to promote differentiation of na&#x000ef;ve CD4 T-cells into IFN-g-expressing Th1 cells. Mo and slanDC decreased in phagocytosis capacity after FTY and FTY-P.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> For the first time we present direct immunomodulatory effects of FTY on different APC subpopulations in contrast to known impact on T and B lymphocyte trafficking. These results suggest the possibility of impact on T cell programming by FTY.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section953-1352458514547846"><title>P958</title><sec id="section954-1352458514547846"><title>Steady state pharmacokinetics and blood lymphocyte responses in healthy subjects dosed with XP23829, a novel fumaric acid ester for multiple sclerosis</title><p><underline>L Steinman</underline><sup>1</sup>, RJ Fox<sup>2</sup>, D Lissin<sup>3</sup>, L Clark<sup>3</sup>, K Cundy<sup>3</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Stanford School of Medicine, Department of Neurology and Neurological Sciences, Stanford, CA, United States, <sup>2</sup>Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Mellen Center for Multiple Sclerosis Treatment and Research, Cleveland, OH, United States, <sup>3</sup>XenoPort, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, United States</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> XP23829 is an innovative prodrug of monomethyl fumarate (MMF), the same active metabolite produced by dimethyl fumarate (DMF).

Each cohort received 7 days at maintenance dose following up to 4 days of up-titration: Formulation 1 at 200 mg BID or 400 mg BID (fasted); Formulation 2 at 800 mg QD (fed or fasted) and 500 mg BID (fed). An additional cohort received DMF (Tecfidera<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, BG-12) 240 mg BID (fasted; fed on Day 7). PK of MMF in blood and plasma were determined on Day 7 (Days 6 and 7 for DMF). Clinical labs were assessed at screening, baseline, Day 8 (1 day after last dose) and follow-up (8-10 days after last dose).</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Mean area under the curve over 24 hours (AUC<sub>ss,24</sub>) values in plasma MMF were 3670 and 6910 ng*hr/mL for 200 and 400 mg BID Formulation 1, respectively and 7010 ng*hr/mL for DMF (fasted).

<italic>In vitro</italic>, teriflunomide inhibited proliferation of human T and B cells stimulated with anti-CD3 or CpG, respectively, and strongly inhibited proliferation of mouse T cells stimulated with high-affinity peptides; it had no impact on cell viability. Teriflunomide-treated EAE rats had reduced CNS T- and B-cell infiltration, reduced disease severity and preserved neuronal conduction in somatosensory and motor tracts. Teriflunomide-treated mice developed effective but slightly delayed (&#x0003c; 2 weeks) memory and primary antibody responses to adenovirus. Teriflunomide-treated patients with MS mounted effective memory responses to influenza vaccine (TERIVA, NCT01403376), and teriflunomide-dosed healthy subjects made seroprotective antibody responses to rabies vaccine (neoantigen), albeit at lower titers than those given placebo. The TEMSO (NCT00134563) and TOWER (NCT00751881) trials showed significant decreases in annualized relapse rates and CNS lesion accumulation (TEMSO only; not tested in TOWER) vs placebo, consistent with an anti-inflammatory MoA for teriflunomide. There was no evidence of immunosuppression in TEMSO, its extension (NCT00803049) or TOWER; infection and malignancy rates were similar to placebo. Mean leukocyte counts were reduced by &#x0003c; 15% from baseline, but remained in the normal range.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Teriflunomide modulates immunity through selectively inhibiting proliferation of activated T and B cells. Our observations provide insight into the mechanism by which teriflunomide treatment reduces disease severity while preserving protective immunity in patients with MS.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section957-1352458514547846"><title>P960</title><sec id="section958-1352458514547846"><title>Enhanced axonal metabolism in multiple sclerosis patients treated with natalizumab</title><p><underline>OT Wiebenga</underline><sup>1,2</sup>, AM Klauser<sup>2</sup>, MM Schoonheim<sup>2</sup>, GJA Nagtegaal<sup>1,2</sup>, MD Steenwijk<sup>1</sup>, JA van Rossum<sup>3</sup>, CH Polman<sup>3</sup>, F Barkhof<sup>1</sup>, PJW Pouwels<sup>4</sup>, JJG Geurts<sup>2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>VU University Medical Center, Radiology and Nuclear Medicine, Amsterdam, Netherlands, <sup>2</sup>VU University Medical Center, Anatomy and Neurosciences, Amsterdam, Netherlands, <sup>3</sup>VU University Medical Center, Neurology, Amsterdam, Netherlands, <sup>4</sup>VU University Medical Center, Physics &#x00026; Medical Technology, Amsterdam, Netherlands</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> The anti-inflammatory effect of natalizumab, second-line therapy for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) in most countries, leads to a dramatic reduction in the formation of white matter (WM) lesions, a decrease in the whole-brain atrophy rate as well as improved rates of clinical progression and relapses. Previous spectroscopy studies have shown that patients treated with interferon beta-1b (IFNb) or glatiramer acetate (GA) have increased total N-acetylaspartate over total creatine (tNAA/tCr) ratios, whereas the effect of natalizumab on brain metabolite concentrations remains unknown.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To investigate the longitudinal effect of natalizumab on absolute concentrations of brain metabolites in RRMS patients using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI).</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> 25 RRMS patients initiating natalizumab treatment were included and scanned every six months for 18 months. Control groups included 18 RRMS patients with similar disease duration and lesion volumes, continuing IFNb or GA and 12 healthy controls, matched for age and sex. Imaging included short echo-time 2D-MRSI with absolute metabolite quantification of tNAA, tCr, choline-containing compounds (Cho), myo-inositol (Ins) and glutamate (Glu). Concentrations were determined for whole regions of lesional white matter (LWM), normal appearing white matter (NAWM) and grey matter (GM).</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> At baseline in both patient groups, lower concentrations of tNAA and tCr were found in LWM compared to NAWM and additionally lower Glu in LWM of natalizumab patients. In natalizumab patients only, significant metabolite increases were found for LWM tNAA (7%, p&#x0003c; 0.001), tCr (6%, p=0.042) and Glu (10%, p=0.028), while lesion volumes did not change. In IFNb/GA patients, no significant change was measured in LWM for any metabolite, while lesion volumes increased. NAWM and GM metabolite concentrations remained stable in both patient groups and the healthy control group.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Only patients treated with natalizumab showed an increase in tNAA, tCr and Glu in lesional white matter. These increasing metabolite concentrations might be a sign of enhanced axonal metabolism due to the anti-inflammatory effect of natalizumab.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section959-1352458514547846"><title>P961</title><sec id="section960-1352458514547846"><title>Characterization of CD56bright NK cells in daclizumab HYP-treated RRMS patients</title><p><underline>DJ Huss</underline><sup>1</sup>, MF Fragoso<sup>1</sup>, P Cullen<sup>2</sup>, N Allaire<sup>2</sup>, JD Fontenot<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Biogen Idec, Immunology Research, Cambridge, MA, United States, <sup>2</sup>Biogen Idec, Computational Biology and Genomics, Cambridge, MA, United States</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Daclizumab HYP (DAC HYP) is a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds the alpha chain (CD25) of the high affinity IL-2 receptor and prevents its association with IL-2. DAC HYP inhibits high affinity IL-2R&#x003b1;-dependent IL-2 signaling while leaving intermediate affinity IL-2R&#x003b2;&#x003b3; signaling intact. CD56<sup>bright</sup> natural killer (NK) cells express low levels of IL-2R&#x003b1; but high levels of IL-2R&#x003b2;&#x003b3; and are expanded in DAC HYP-treated relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) patients. It is hypothesized that the increased numbers of CD56<sup>bright</sup> NK cells contribute to the therapeutic efficacy of DAC HYP. Previous work has reported that CD56<sup>bright</sup> NK cells act either through the production of immunoregulatory cytokines or through direct cytolytic activity.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To characterize the impact of CD25 blockade on CD56<sup>bright</sup> NK cells and to investigate the contribution of CD56<sup>bright</sup> NK cells to the therapeutic efficacy of DAC HYP.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Banked cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from DAC HYP- and placebo-treated RRMS patients enrolled in the SELECT phase II clinical trial were analyzed. Phenotypic characterization of NK cells was performed by flow cytometry. Transcriptional profiling of FACS sort-purified NK cells subsets from pre-treatment baseline and post-treatment week 24 and week 52 was performed. <italic>In vitro</italic> functional studies were conducted to determine the effects of high- and intermediate-affinity IL-2R signaling on both healthy donor NK cells and NK cells from DAC HYP-treated RRMS patients.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> DAC HYP-treatment differentially affected NK cell subsets, including expression of IL-2R components and NK cell receptors.

CD39 is an ectonucleotidase that cleaves ATP to AMP and has been suggested as a novel marker for regulatory T cells (Treg). As ATP has numerous pro-inflammatory effects, its degradation by CD39 could be beneficial. Fingolimod, used for the treatment of relapsing-remitting (RR) MS, interferes with T cell egress from lymph nodes. Its effect on Tregs is only partially described.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> The purpose of this study was to explore whether regulatory mechanisms are induced in fingolimod-treated MS patients.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMC) were collected from healthy controls and RRMS patients before starting fingolimod therapy and 3 months after treatment initiation. Natural Treg frequency was assessed by the novel technique of methylation-specific qPCR of the first intron of <italic>FOXP3. Ex vivo</italic> cytokine expression in PBMCs was analyzed by qPCR. <italic>Ex vivo</italic> CD39 expression was analyzed by flow cytometry in CD4<sup>+</sup>, CD8<sup>+</sup>, CD19<sup>+</sup> cells as well as in CD4<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>hi</sup> Tregs. CD39 activity was assessed by ATP luminometry.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Natural Treg frequency was similar between MS patients and healthy controls. B cell, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell and Treg proportions were largely reduced by fingolimod. <italic>Ex vivo</italic> CD39 mRNA levels were however increased in MS patients, in comparison to healthy controls. Fingolimod treatment further increased CD39 and AHR mRNA levels in PBMCs, while IL-17A, IL-22 and FOXP3 mRNA were reduced. The proportion of CD39<sup>+</sup> Tregs was increased by fingolimod but not of CD39<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>-</sup> T cells. Fingolimod reduced the proportion of CD39<sup>+</sup>CD19<sup>+</sup> B cells and CD39<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. We could not detect however any change in CD39 activity following treatment by fingolimod.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Fingolimod not only mediates CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell retention, but also decreases the proportion of CD19<sup>+</sup> circulating B cells. Interestingly, the proportion of circulating CD39<sup>+</sup> Tregs is specifically increased. This observation could have functional relevance to the therapeutic effects of fingolimod, as CD39<sup>+</sup> Tregs have been shown to suppress pathogenic Th17 cells<sup>1</sup>. Work is in progress to understand whether this effect is purely related to the cellular redistribution mediated by fingolimod or could be due to interference with sphingosine-1-P receptor signaling at the cellular level.</p><list list-type="order" id="list23-1352458514547846"><list-item><p>Fletcher JM et al.

Laquinimod crosses the blood-brain barrier and enters the CNS, thus in addition to peripheral actions it may directly impact CNS-resident lineages including astrocytes and microglia, which increasing evidence implicates as key regulators of CNS inflammation. Interleukin-1beta (IL-1&#x003b2;) is implicated in lesion pathogenesis in MS, and is a strong inducer of astroglial reactivity in human cultures.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> Here, we report that laquinimod profoundly impacts proinflammatory gene expression in a primary human model of reactive astrogliosis <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Primary human astrocytes were isolated and treated with IL-1&#x003b2; in combination with laquinimod. Cells were examined via microarray analysis, QPCR, and multiplex ELISA.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> We found that IL-1&#x003b2; 10ng/ml induced a pro-inflammatory transcriptional pattern in primary human astrocytes which encompassed induction of inflammatory cytokines, reactive nitrogen species, chemokines, adhesion molecules, matrix metalloproteinases, and inducers of endothelial plasticity and blood-brain barrier permeability, as shown by microarray analysis, QPCR and multiplex ELISA. Importantly, at therapeutic concentrations, laquinimod dose-dependently abrogated IL-1&#x003b2; induction of cytokines including TNF&#x003b1;, IL-6, IFN&#x003b1;, IL-12 and IL-23, inducible nitric oxide synthase, the matrix metalloproteases MMP7 and MMP10, and the permeability factor VEGF-A, implicated as a driver of BBB disruption. Suggesting immunomodulation rather than suppression, laquinimod differentially regulated IL-1&#x003b2;-induced expression of CXC and CC chemokines, inhibiting induction of CXCL1,2,5,6,8 and 10 and CCL8 while potentiating CCL5 and CXCL14. IL-1&#x003b2; signals via the transcription factor NF-&#x003ba;B, and suggesting mechanism, laquinimod treatment delayed IL-1&#x003b2;-induced I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; degradation and NF-&#x003ba;B p65 nuclear translocation.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Collectively, these data reveal laquinimod as a regulator of the proinflammatory phenotype in a human model of reactive astrogliosis, and suggest that it may act on resident cells to reduce production of cytotoxic mediators, restrict inflammatory cell chemotaxis and migration, and rescue blood-brain barrier integrity. Laquinimod therapy may restrict lesion pathogenesis in RRMS and other inflammatory CNS conditions, via direct actions on immune-competent CNS-resident cells.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section965-1352458514547846"><title>P964</title><sec id="section966-1352458514547846"><title>The effect of immune therapeutic agents on the T-cell receptor repertoire in MS-patients</title><p><underline>T Dehmel</underline><sup>1</sup>, C Warnke<sup>1</sup>, AK Mausberg<sup>1</sup>, M Comabella<sup>2</sup>, X Montalban<sup>2</sup>, H-P Hartung<sup>1</sup>, BC Kieseier<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Heinrich-Heine-University, Neurology, D&#x000fc;sseldorf, Germany, <sup>2</sup>Universitari Vall d&#x02019;Hebron, Servei de Neurologia-Neuroimmunologia, Barcelona, Spain</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> In healthy individuals the V-beta element lengths of the TCR represent a Gaussian distribution, whereas MS patients exhibit shifted patterns or oligoclonal expansions of several V-beta elements.

The analysis of the TCR repertoire seems to mirror their specific mode of action: While immunomodulators like IFN-beta or GA are not expected to show a variation in the TCR repertoire, the increase of the peripheral T cell expansion under treatment with Fingo could be a result of the retention of specific T cells in the lymph nodes. The &#x02018;normalizing&#x02019; effect on the peripheral TCR repertoire under treatment with Nat may reflect an altered immune surveillance of the CNS, which leads to an inhibition of a secondary oligoclonal T cell expansion in the periphery.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section967-1352458514547846"><title>P965</title><sec id="section968-1352458514547846"><title>Reduction in microglia activation measured by [11C]PK11195-PET in patients treated with natalizumab</title><p>A Maoz<sup>1</sup>, E Monohan<sup>1</sup>, P Kothari<sup>1</sup>, L Solnes<sup>1</sup>, N Nealon<sup>1</sup>, J Perumal<sup>1</sup>, C Riley<sup>2</sup>, S Newman<sup>3</sup>, T Vartanian<sup>1</sup>, S Vallabhajosula<sup>1</sup>, D Mozely<sup>1</sup>, <underline>S Gauthier</underline><sup>4</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, United States, <sup>2</sup>Columbia University Medical College, New York, NY, United States, <sup>3</sup>North Shore University Hospital, Manhasset, NY, United States, <sup>4</sup>Weill Cornell Medical College, Judith Jaffe Multiple Sclerosis Center, New York, NY, United States</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> The primary innate immune cells in multiple sclerosis (MS) consist of infiltrating macrophages/monocytes and resident microglia for which function to cause CNS injury both through direct effects on neighboring cells, such as oligodendrocytes, and through generation of soluble proinflammatory mediators that have distant effects on cells, such as neurons. [C11]-PK11195 (PK) is a Positron Emission Tomography (PET) radioligand known to bind to the translocator protein expressed by activated microglia and macrophages. Natalizumab, approved for treatment of relapsing-remitting (RR), has a primary mechanism thought to be mediated through the blockade VLA-4 integrins, which diminishes the migratory capacity of peripherally derived immune cells. However, the effect of natalizumab on innate immune inflammatory burden in within the CNS is unknown.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To determine the effect natalizumab on whole-brain binding of [C11]-PK11195 as well as within lesions at 3 and 6 months of treatment.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Twelve RRMS patients starting natalizumab therapy were included in the study. Dynamic images of brain [C11]-PK11195-PET were acquired over a period of 60 minutes at baseline, 3 months and 6 months post Natalizumab treatment. Quantification of PK uptake was done by volume of distribution (V<sub>T</sub>) calculation using image-derived input function. Input time activity curves were computed using the carotid artery using fine reconstruction of 60 frames of 3 seconds each that allows capturing the peak in activity. Full pharmacokinetic quantification was done using a segmented MRI including the caudate, putamen, cerebellum, cortical gray matter, white matter, whole brain and total lesion.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> At the time of this abstract, quantification of [C11]-PK11195-PET uptake at each brain region was completed in 10 patients. After the start of natalizumab treatment, half of the patients (5) demonstrated a significant decrease in VT (&#x0003e;16%, P &#x0003c; 0.001) in all regions by 6 months. Moreover, among all the 10 patients, the average VT of all regions significantly decreased by 4.4% (P&#x0003c; 0.05).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> These results suggest that PK-PET may be a useful tool to quantify the therapeutic reduction of the innate immune response in MS patients. In patients treated with Natalizumab, the beneficial effect may expand beyond the reduction of migratory capacity of immune cells and reduce innate immune burden within lesions as well as in other brain regions indicating a global reduction in CNS immune burden.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section969-1352458514547846"><title>P966</title><sec id="section970-1352458514547846"><title>High dose corticosteroid treatment alters transcripts of susceptibility genes in peripheral blood of multiple sclerosis patients</title><p><underline>H Faber</underline><sup>1</sup>, S Nischwitz<sup>1</sup>, M Knop<sup>1</sup>, P Weber<sup>1</sup>, B P&#x000fc;tz<sup>1</sup>, F Weber<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Max Planck Institute of Psychiatry, Munich, Germany</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> To date, more than 100 genetic risk loci associated with multiple sclerosis (MS) have been detected in two recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS), which are mainly related to genes with key functions in the immune system.

Initially identified over a decade ago, miRNAs are estimated to target approximately 60% of the mammalian genome, including genes known to influence both innate and adaptive immunity. In recent years, miRNAs have been suggested as potential biomarkers and biological targets of emerging drug therapies in immune disorders and neurodegenerative diseases. In multiple sclerosis (MS), miRNAs are abnormally expressed in cells comprising the immune and central nervous systems, including T cells, B cells, and macrophages/microglia.

Recently, Schwab and colleagues showed a correlation between a low expression of CD62L on CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells and the development of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) in Natalizumab(NTZ)-treated Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patients.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To verify the effect of NTZ treatment on the expression of CD62L on CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and the possible correlation with PML.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Patients were recruited by CRESM, San Luigi, University Hospital. We conducted a flow cytometry analysis on cryopreserved, viable peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 14 healthy donors (HD) and 127 patients with MS: 74 had been treated with NTZ (1-86 months), 42 received other treatments (22 with Interferon beta, IFNb; 20 with Glatiramer acetate, GA) and 10 were untreated (T0). We also analyzed one PML case in a NTZ-treated patient from the Multiple Sclerosis Center of the University of Chieti.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The percentage of L-selectin on CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells was significantly lower in patients treated with NTZ (34.98% &#x000b1; 13.39; mean &#x000b1; SD) when compared to patients treated with GA (49.30% &#x000b1; 14.03; p=0.0004), IFNb (45.71% &#x000b1; 19.22; p=0.0237) or HD (45.41% &#x000b1; 10.08; p=0.0057). There are no significant differences between NTZ-treated and T0 patients (42.09% &#x000b1; 9.36). Interestingly, we found two outliers for the expression of CD62L<sup>+</sup> on CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells in GA-treated group and in T0 patients. In the NTZ-treated group three patients had values lower than the calculated risk threshold 13.57% (mean-2x SD of IFNb+GA group). The effect of NTZ was already evident during the first year of treatment, and persisted in the following years (p=0.0048, compared to IFNb+GA group). In the three high risk patients two CD62L serial evaluations were performed, during NTZ treatment and four months after withdrawal: during treatment 2 out of 3 had low values of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD62L<sup>+</sup> which increased to normal values 4 months after discontinuation. We also had the opportunity to analyze a patient in the acute PML/IRIS phase, 4 months after NTZ withdrawal and under steroid treatment, CD62L expression was 30.48%.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> NTZ treatment decreases the expression of CD62L on circulating CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. This effect is already evident in the first year of treatment and disappears after withdrawal of treatment. The study of the effect of NTZ on CD4<sup>+</sup>CD62L<sup>+</sup> cells can be a valuable tool to personalize NTZ therapy.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section975-1352458514547846"><title>P969</title><sec id="section976-1352458514547846"><title>Distinct effects of fingolimod on gene expression of T-cell subsets in the blood of patients with multiple sclerosis</title><p><underline>B Fitzner</underline><sup>1,2</sup>, M Hecker<sup>1,2</sup>, D Koczan<sup>2</sup>, J Friess<sup>1</sup>, L Roch<sup>1</sup>, I Schr&#x000f6;der<sup>1</sup>, K Flechtner<sup>2</sup>, H-J Thiesen<sup>2</sup>, A Winkelmann<sup>1</sup>, UK Zettl<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>University of Rostock, Department of Neurology, Rostock, Germany, <sup>2</sup>University of Rostock, Institute of Immunology, Rostock, Germany</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Fingolimod is an oral disease-modifying agent approved for the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS). It is a sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modulator that prevents the egress of CD4+ T helper cells and CD8+ cytotoxic T cells from lymphoid tissues. In particular, the percentages of naive T cells and central memory T cells, which express the homing receptor CCR7, are reduced in the peripheral blood of treated patients. However, the precise molecular effects on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells have so far not been investigated at the transcriptome level.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To study the gene expression patterns of T cells before and during fingolimod treatment in order to better understand the molecular mechanisms of the drug and to identify biomarkers of the individual biological response to therapy.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> With informed consent, blood samples were drawn from 10 patients with relapsing-remitting MS at 3 different time points: before fingolimod treatment initiation (baseline) as well as after 24 hours and 3 months. CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were separated by magnetic-activated cell sorting. Cellular RNA was isolated and then analyzed with Affymetrix Human Transcriptome Arrays (HTA) 2.0, which contain &#x0003e;6.0 million distinct probes covering &#x0003e;70.000 coding and non-coding transcripts.

However, after 3 months, 979 genes and 172 genes were differentially expressed in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, respectively. The levels of a subset of 37 genes were altered in both cell types, e.g. FCGR3A, FCGR3B (up-regulated) and CCR7 (down-regulated). Average CCR7 mRNA levels were in particular decreased in CD8+ T cells. An analysis of gene functions revealed that common and distinct biological processes and pathways are affected in both T cell subsets.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Treatment with fingolimod leads to a marked reduction of lymphocytes in the peripheral blood. Here, we present the first study that used high-resolution gene expression microarrays to analyze how the molecular properties of two different T cell subsets are modulated during therapy.

Each patient was sampled before initiation of Natalizumab and one year thereafter. Optimal responders were defined as relapse free and disability progression free patients and a gene expression profile of this group was evaluated by paired t-test. Genes with p&#x0003c; 0.05 after Bonferroni correction were defined as most informative genes (MIG&#x02019;s). Gene expression differences between optimal and sub-optimal responders over 1 year and functional analysis using Ingenuity software were performed.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Seventy eight percent (n=52) of patients under Natalizumab treatment were relapse and disease progression free.

Natalyzumab respoders were characterized by 508 MIGs enriched by mechanisms of B cells activation including B cells development (p=8.7E-08), PI3K Signaling in B lymphocytes (p=6.1E-06), and BCR signaling (p=3.4E-04). Sub-optimal responders were differed in gene expression of 345 genes (p&#x0003c; 0.05 by T-test). Interestingly, this profiles was also enriched by genes related to B cells development (p=2.8E-04), however, based on completely different pathway components. Sub-optimal responders were characterized by activation of immunoglobulins family genes including IGHD, IGHM, IGKC, IGLC1, CD43.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> At one year of Natalizumab treatment patients with sub-optimal clinical response demonstrated over-expression of specific subset of immunoglobulins related genes.

CD25 expression, CD56<sup>bright</sup> NK cells (CD3-CD16<sup>+</sup>CD56<sup>bright</sup>), and Tregs (CD4<sup>+</sup>CD127<sup>low/-</sup>FoxP3<sup>+</sup>), were measured by validated FACS assays. Serum IL-2 levels were measured by a validated immuno-PCR ELISA. Results were compared to subjects who had been on long-term treatment with DAC HYP 150mg in the SELECTED study, including a subset of subjects that experienced a 6 month washout during long-term treatment.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Complete saturation of CD25 on T cells was seen by 8 hours after the first SC injection of DAC HYP 150mg and sustained through the monitored treatment period, up to 2 years. By day 4, Tregs declined by &#x02248;25% and continued to decline and then plateaued at &#x02248;-60% change from baseline after week 8. A notable &#x02248;50% increase in CD56<sup>bright</sup> NK cells was seen by day 8 and the expansion continued in year 1 of treatment resulting in &#x02248;5-fold increase by week 52. Serum IL-2 levels increased &#x02248;2-fold by 4 weeks and were stable thereafter. In subjects who received DAC HYP for 3 years, the expansion of CD56<sup>bright</sup> counts plateaued after year 1 and counts were then maintained in years 2 and 3. After the initial decline up to week 8, Tregs were maintained at a constant reduced level in years 2 and 3. Furthermore, the observed effects of DAC HYP on CD56 <sup>bright</sup> NK cells and Tregs were reversible to baseline levels over 6 months of washout and after re-initiation of treatment mirrored the dynamics of the first year of treatment.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The PD effects of DAC HYP have an early onset of action and are sustained during treatment, yet reversible upon washout.

Tregs play a role in autoimmunity and supposedly control autoreactivity. iNKT cells are potent cytokine producers and have immunoregulatory potential. Fingolimod (FTY) induces lymphocyte retention in lymph nodes, decreasing the severity of inflammatory phenomena. However, little is known on the dynamics of the cell populations that are involved in lymph node entrapment.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To evaluate numbers of peripheral Treg and iNKT cells in Relapsing-Remitting (RR) MS patients before and after 3, 7, 14 days and 1, 6 and 12 months of treatment with FTY.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were volumetrically counted on whole blood using a CyFlow Counter (Partec, Muenster, Germany). Isolated PBMC were stained with different mAbs and analyzed with a 16 parameter Partec CyFlow ML. Treg cells were identified using the following mAbs: anti-CD3, -CD4, -CD25, -CD127, Foxp3; iNKT cells were recognized using anti-CD3, -CD4, -CD8, CD161 and -Va24Ja18. Data was analyzed by FlowJo 9.7.4 and Stata 11.0 softwares using Ranksum and Anova test.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Nine RRMS patients were enrolled and followed up for one year. The number of CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells decreased after 1 month of therapy (median number of CD3+ from 1281/ul to 267/ul, CD4+ from 737/ul to 39/ul and CD8 from 460/ul to 245/ul; CD4% from 61.5 to 20.75), and remained at low values, while the percentage of CD8 increased (from 30.90% to 55.20%). Moreover, FTY induced a significant increase in the amount of peripheral Tregs (from 3% to 7%). The number and percentage of iNKT did not change during treatment of FTY. However, we observed that within iNKT cells, the percentage of those expressing CD4+ decreased (from 53.5% to 27% among iNKT), while those that were CD4- and CD8- (i.e., double negative, DN) increased during the first 14 days of therapy (from 20.60% to 43.10% among iNKT).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> FTY increased the circulating levels of Tregs; this is consistent with the capability of restoring Treg homeostasis in MS patients. Moreover, FTY causes a reduction in iNKT cells expressing CD4, that produce Th2-type cytokines, and an increase of DN iNKT, that are less cytotoxic than those expressing CD8+. Taken together, these data suggest a double beneficial role of FTY in MS through the negative modulation of inflammatory iNKT cells and the restoration of Treg homeostasis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section985-1352458514547846"><title>P974</title><sec id="section986-1352458514547846"><title>Increased neutralization capacity of TNF-&#x003b1; in sera of MS patients may play a role in MS pathogenesis and is reversed by therapy with interferon-&#x003b2;</title><p>K Fainberg<sup>1</sup>, K Regev<sup>1</sup>, O Dorman<sup>1</sup>, <underline>A Karni</underline><sup>1,2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center, Neurology, Tel Aviv, Israel, <sup>2</sup>Sackler&#x02019;s Medical School, Tel Aviv, Israel</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> High TNF&#x003b1; is found in active MS lesions and in CSF of MS patients it correlates with disease activity.

The capacity of sera to neutralize TNF&#x003b1; bioactivity was studied by a neutralization of TNF&#x003b1;- induced death of L929 cell line. Briefly, 1ng/ml of rhTNF&#x003b1; was incubated with two fold dilutions of sera from donors for 2hr, 37&#x000b0;C. Then, 50&#x000b5;l/well of the serum-rhTNF&#x003b1; mixed solution was added to the cells, with1&#x000b5;g/ml Actinomycin D, for overnight, 37&#x000b0;C, 5% CO2.

MS symptoms are consequence from interruption of nerve impulse on the myelinated tracts of the CNS. Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (PDCs) are the major producers of type 1 interferon and may express molecules like indoleamine-2-3-oxigenase (IDO) and HLA-g with immunosuppressive effect. As MS is a disease with inflammation-related symptoms, all medicines for MS aim modulating or suppressing the inflammatory response. In recent years several drugs based on monoclonal antibodies have been developed an attempt to ameliorate the symptoms of MS. Natalizumab (NTZ), an anti-VLA-4 monoclonal antibody which binds to the &#x003b1;4 subunit of &#x003b1;4&#x003b2;1 and &#x003b1;4&#x003b2;7 integrins expressed on the surface of activated T cells, avoids the migration across the blood-brain barrier toward to the CNS by endothelial receptors such as VCAM-1 and ICAM-1.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> In this work we aimed to investigate the behavior of PDCs from MS patients submitted to treatment with NTZ.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Male and female MS patients (N=16) and healthy controls between 20 and 40 years old were our group of study. For performing the experiments, PBMCs were separated from the blood and some cerebrospinal fluid was collected. Anti-BDCA-2 and anti-HLA-g antibodies (BD Biosciences) were used to mark the cells of interest and the samples were acquired in a FACS Calibur&#x000ae; flow cytometer. The results were analyzed using the software Kaluza. Mann-Whitney test was used for the statistical analyses and p-value &#x0003c; 0.5 was considered significant.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> In patients with relapsing-remitting MS treated with NTZ, we observed a significant increase of HLA-g expressing on PDCs from the peripheral blood and the presence of HLA-G in PDCs in cerebrospinal fluid.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our results suggest that in addition to blocking the migration of activated T cells, NTZ may contribute to the modulation of the inflammatory response in patients with MS.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section989-1352458514547846"><title>P976</title><sec id="section990-1352458514547846"><title>Effects of alemtuzumab on selective immune cell subsets in the blood of patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis</title><p><underline>K Thomas</underline><sup>1</sup>, J Blankeburg<sup>1</sup>, J Eisele<sup>1</sup>, T Ziemssen<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>University Hospital Dresden, Center of Clinical Neuroscience, Dresden, Germany</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> The monoclonal anti-CD52 antibody alemtuzumab mediates antibody and complement-depending cytotoxicity.

Surface and intracellular markers of T-cell, B-cell, NK-cell and APC subpopulations were characterized with fluorescence-labeled antibodies and evaluated on LSR-Fortessa.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Regarding CD52 expression, CD8+ and Treg-cells presented lower CD52-baseline expression than CD4+ and Th17 T-cells. CD52-baseline expression did not differ in B-cells. Baseline CD52-expression displayed lowest amounts on NK cells, compared to other cell subsets. CD52-expression was similar low between all investigated APC subtypes.</p><p>Absolute numbers of CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells decreased after alemtuzumab persisting up to M24. Relative number of CD4+ lymphocytes remained depleted, whereas CD8+ lymphocytes reached baseline values at M6. In M3, CD4+ and CD8+ CD45RA+ cells decreased and returned to baseline after M12. CD4+ and CD8+ CD45RO+cells proceeded in the opposite way. CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ Treg-cells increased in M3. Th17 T-cells decreased persistently after alemtuzumab.. Alemtuzumab decreased the number of CD19+ B-cells which recovered until M12. Individual B-cell subsets including CD19+CD27+ B-cells showed a persistent decrease, whereas CD19+CD5+ B-cells increased again. Absolute numbers of NK-cells were not affected by alemtuzumab treatment. Percentage of CD3-CD56+ NK-cells increased from baseline. There were no changes regarding frequency of monocytes, slanDC and CD1+DC. Only BDCA2+DC decreased after alemtuzumab.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Alemtuzumab lead to an effective depletion of most but not all investigated immune cell subtypes. Different reconstitution patterns and CD52-baseline expression may predict and account for individual cell depletion and immunosuppressive effects.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section991-1352458514547846"><title>P977</title><sec id="section992-1352458514547846"><title>Investigation of the effects of itraconazole, a probe CYP3A and P-glycoprotein inhibitor, on the pharmacokinetics of ceralifimod (ONO-4641)</title><p><underline>S Kr&#x000f6;sser</underline><sup>1</sup>, P Wolna<sup>1</sup>, W Geng<sup>2</sup>, N Matsunaga<sup>3</sup>, C Hasegawa<sup>3</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, <sup>2</sup>EMD Serono, Inc., Billerica, MA, United States, <sup>3</sup>Ono Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Ibaraki, Japan</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Ceralifimod (ONO-4641) is an oral, selective, non-prodrug, sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor-1 and -5 agonist in clinical development for the treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. <italic>In vitro</italic> studies have shown that ceralifimod is slowly and partially metabolized, mainly by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 and CYP3A5, and that it is a substrate of the drug transporter P-glycoprotein (Pgp).</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> The purpose of this mechanistic drug-drug interaction (DDI) study was to investigate the effects of repeated oral doses of itraconazole, a prototypic strong CYP3A and Pgp inhibitor, on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of ceralifimod, specifically the role of CYP3A in ceralifimod metabolism and the role of Pgp in the systemic exposure of ceralifimod.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> 16 healthy volunteers (6 men, 10 women) were included in this open-label, sequential, two-period trial. In the first period, ceralifimod PK was assessed under fasting conditions and without itraconazole coadministration: subjects received a single 0.15-mg dose of ceralifimod on Day 1. In the second period, ceralifimod PK was assessed in combination with itraconazole: subjects received 200 mg itraconazole once daily for 14 days starting on Day 23 and a second single dose of ceralifimod 0.15 mg on Day 26 (fourth day of itraconazole administration). Serial blood samples collected over 312 hours post ceralifimod dosing in both study periods were assessed via validated high-performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometric detection to quantify ceralifimod PK assessments.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Ceralifimod concentration-time profiles and PK parameters remained essentially unaltered when coadministered with itraconazole. The statistical analysis resulted in test/reference ratio estimates for peak concentration (C<sub>max</sub>) and area under the curve (AUC<sub>0-264h</sub>) close to 100% (99.7% and 103.5%, respectively). 90% confidence intervals derived from the residual error term (90.9-109.4% for C<sub>max</sub>; 93.7-114.4% for AUC<sub>0-264h</sub>) were within the usual interval (80-125%) for bioequivalence studies.

Optimising the dosing and monitoring the regimen of RTX treatment is an urgent challenge for the management of patients with relapsing autoimmune disorders of CNS. This means maximizing the efficacy of the RTX treatment and reducing overtreatment, and the cost and risks of severe adverse events. Monitoring blood CD19+ B cells by Flow Cytometry (FC) is the common strategy to personalize RTX re-treatment (Treatment-to-target-approach), but relapses occur despite CD19 antigen remaining under the threshold (&#x0003c; 0.1% total lymphocytes), possibly due to a limited sensitivity of FC.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> Aim of the present study is to compare pre-amplification (PA) Real Time PCR (RT-PCR) blood CD19 mRNA quantification with FC.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Five series of blood samples from 3 NMOSD patients treated with RTX were studied (47 blood samples), analysing CD19+ B cells by FC and PA-RT-PCR; a positivity threshold for PA-RT-PCR was defined (CD19 mRNA Relative Expression &#x0003e; 1,739x10<sup>-3</sup>).</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> CD19+ B cells were quantified by PA-RT-PCR in all 47 samples, whereas they were &#x0003c; 0.1% of total lymphocytes in 31/47 samples analysed by FC. In all samples in which CD19+ B cells were above FC threshold, CD19 mRNA was also above its threshold. Interestingly, CD19 mRNA was also above PA-RT-PCR threshold in 8 other paired samples, which resulted negative by FC, and preceded the positivity of FC in 7 out 8 of them by 1 -3 months.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The present study indicates that the PA-RT-PCR method could be a more sensitive strategy than FC for the detection of CD19+ B cells, thus improving the treatment-to-target approach of RTX retreatment. This approach could be applied to other RTX- treated diseases and to other monoclonal antibodies directed against CD20+ B cells.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section995-1352458514547846"><title>P979</title><sec id="section996-1352458514547846"><title>Peripheral blood lymphocyte count: a possible immunological marker of fingolimod efficacy?</title><p><underline>M Zaffaroni</underline><sup>1</sup>, D Baroncini<sup>1</sup>, A Bianchi<sup>1</sup>, P Annovazzi<sup>1</sup>, SM Baldini<sup>1</sup>, G Minonzio<sup>2</sup>, A Ghezzi<sup>1</sup>, G Comi<sup>3</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Multiple Sclerosis Study Centre, S.

Raffaele Hospital, Milan, Italy</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Fingolimod 0.5 mg (FTY) is an established oral drug for relapsing-remitting (RR) multiple sclerosis (MS). FTY inhibits lymphocytes egress from lymph nodes, interrupting their recirculation to the central nervous system. As a consequence, blood lymphocyte count (L) decreases to 20-30% of baseline. There are no data regarding immunological markers that can be used as a measure of FTY treatment efficacy.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> Our aim was to assess a possible relationship between L and clinical/MRI outcome in MS patients treated with FTY in a clinical setting.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> All consecutive patients who started FTY in our Centre before January 1st, 2013 (n=61) were included; six were excluded due to inadequate number of blood tests. Observation period was 1 year for the whole cohort, 2 years for 29 patients. Neurological exam, blood neutrophil count (N) and L were performed at baseline (T0), after 1 month (T1), then quarterly. Brain MRI was done yearly. Other variables considered: gender, BMI, previous disease-modifying drugs and immunosuppressants (IS), number of relapses 1-2 years before FTY, age and MS duration. Possible confounding factors like steroid courses were recorded. Definition of active patients was: &#x02265;1 new T2 lesions or &#x02265;1 Gd-enhancing lesion at MRI and/or &#x02265;1 relapse and/or &#x02265;1 point worsening in EDSS score confirmed after 6 months.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> we compared active vs disease-free patients with respect to the following variables: L at T0 (L0), L at T1 (L1), mean L (mL) over 1 and 2 years of treatment, &#x00394;L1 (L0-L1) and &#x00394;L (L0-mL). No significant differences were found over 1 year of treatment. A significant difference was found for L0 (2084&#x000b1;392 vs 2428&#x000b1;428; p=0.050) and &#x00394;L1 (1503&#x000b1;402 Vs 1830&#x000b1;314; p=0.049) over 2 years.

This latter finding was not observed for mean N (1401&#x000b1;1486 vs 1151&#x000b1;1039, p=0.344), excluding a relevant direct effect of steroids on L. Multivariate logistic analysis (L0, &#x00394;L1, gender, IS) abolished any statistically significant correlation.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Lower values of L0 and &#x00394;L1 were associated with MS activity over 2 years of FTY treatment. However, such finding was not confirmed by multivariate model. Therefore, in our opinion, peripheral blood lymphocyte count cannot be used as a marker of FTY treatment efficacy.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section997-1352458514547846"><title>P980</title><sec id="section998-1352458514547846"><title>A two-years follow-up study of multiple sclerosis patients treated with interferon-beta: predictive value of NAbs at six months of treatment</title><p>AM Arias-Leal<sup>1</sup>, MI Dominguez-Mozo<sup>1</sup>, M Garcia-Montojo<sup>1</sup>, MA Garcia-Martinez<sup>1</sup>, I Casanova<sup>1</sup>, R Arroyo<sup>1</sup>, <underline>R Alvarez-Lafuente</underline><sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Hospital Clinico San Carlos, Madrid, Spain</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Interferon beta (IFN-beta) is a first-line treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS); although the clinical efficacy of this therapy has been demonstrated consistently in large, randomized, placebo-controlled trials, a proportion of treated patients ranging from 7% to 49% show a poor clinical response.

In response to stress cells of the blood brain barrier make fine tuned regulatory adaptations that result in a continuous matching of tissue oxygen with capillary density (adaptive angioplasticity) that promotes survival. Loss of adaptive angioplasticity may underlie the pathophysiology of a number of neurodegenerative diseases including multiple sclerosis (MS).

Induction of angioplasticity was associated with induction of hypoxia inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1a) and VEGF as well as increased vascular density and decreased evidence of leukocyte migration to the spinal cord. In addition, endothelial activation markers VCAM and uPAR were decreased in the spinal cords of hypoxia exposed EAE mice.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Stress induced adaptive angioplasticity promotes recovery of EAE. Mechanistic insight may lead to the identification of novel therapeutic targets that will promote tissue repair. Current knowledge of pathophisiology and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases requires further research in this area. The intent of the study is to identify new molecular targets that promote repair in neurodegenerative diseases including multiple sclerosis. EAE with stress induced angioplasticity is the key model for that study.</p></sec></sec></sec></body></article>
