Non-pharmacological treatments are usually very well accepted by both children and their parents and are free from medication side effects. Nevertheless, they may be as effective as the pharmacological interventions; therefore, according to many experts and based on the majority of current evidence, a non-pharmacological approach should be the first intervention attempt in children with RAP. In particular, the importance of the bio-psychosocial approach is highlighted, as a majority of children will improve with counselling and reassurance that no serious organic pathologies are suspected, especially when the physician establishes a trustful relationship with both the child and their family. Placebo and pharmacological interventions could be attempted when the bio-psychosocial approach is not applicable or not efficacious. In some difficult cases, finding an effective treatment for FAP can be a challenge, and a number of strategies may need to be tried before symptoms are controlled.

</p></sec><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par3">Recurrent abdominal pain (RAP) is one of the most common health complaints in both children and adults. In the majority of cases, RAP represents a non-severe chronic medical condition that is not associated with a properly defined pathology of the gastrointestinal tract and that is characterized by intermittent abdominal pain associated with variety of symptoms that include distension, bloating, an irregular number of daily bowel movements (i.e., varying from constipation to the opposite and diarrhea), nausea or vomiting, lack of appetite or precocious stomach fullness, tiredness, and a general feeling of unhappiness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. When RAP is not associated with a detectable organic issue or pathology, this medical condition can be renamed functional abdominal pain syndrome (FAPS) or, better, according to the recent European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) Rome IV criteria, functional abdominal pain disorders (FAPDs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Although RAP is considered a functional disorder rather than an organic disease, affected children and their families can still experience anxiety and concerns that can interfere with school, sports, and regular daily activities and lead to frequent attendances at pediatric emergency departments or pediatric gastroenterology clinics.</p><p id="Par4">Historically, RAP syndrome was described for the first time in 1958 by Apley and colleagues in a group of scholar students [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]; despite nearly 50&#x000a0;years of scientific efforts aiming to clarify etiopathogenic ambiguities and possible treatments, the management of this syndrome remains a time-consuming and frustrating clinical challenge for most physicians and gastroenterologists. We reviewed the recognized and recent medical literature on RAP in pediatric patients with the aim of disclosing and summarizing the current best management options for this common medical condition. We analysed a selection of recent and relevant scientific contributions on the management of FAP in pediatric patients. The following keywords were used to search among the world medical library collections (MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane, and Cinahl): abdominal pain-related functional gastrointestinal disorders, functional abdominal pain disorders, functional gastro-intestinal disorders, recurrent abdominal pain, functional dyspepsia, irritable bowel syndrome, and FAPD. Preference for the inclusion of studies was given to recent scientific contributions, official medical society guidelines, and reviews over randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and evidence-based medicine. We focused our search on the &#x0201c;non-pharmacological,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;pharmacological,&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;placebo&#x0201d; treatment of the functional abdominal pain of children aged 2&#x02013;18&#x000a0;years, and we covered the period 1 January 2005 to 30 October 2017.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Definitions</title><p id="Par5">The proper definition of RAP is the presence of three or more episodes of abdominal pain over a period of at least 3&#x000a0;months that are sufficiently severe to affect daily activities. Moreover, RAP is a term that, from a strict definition should include both organic and non-organic (i.e., functional) causes of chronic abdominal pain, whereas other terms such as FAPS or FAPDs must be representative of a chronic RAP that is not due to an organic, structural, or metabolic disease, as far as can be detected by common examinations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. However, as only very few cases of RAP are related to a defined organic pathology, RAP is a term that is often used as a synonym of FAPS or FAPDs. In addition, in clinical practice, most physicians will consider a diagnosis of RAP for any intermittent and relapsing abdominal pain that exceeds 1 or 2&#x000a0;months in duration.</p><p id="Par6">Functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) is a term that is commonly used interchangeably with FAPS or FAPDs but, according to the recent Rome IV criteria, should be used to group all the chronic gastrointestinal issues of uncertain origin, including dyspepsia, cyclic vomiting, and others, as presented in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. FAPDs represent a subgroup of FGIDs that includes four defined diagnoses: functional dyspepsia (FD), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), abdominal migraine (AM), and functional abdominal pain&#x02014;not otherwise specified (FAP-NOS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Although not included in the FGIDs group, chronic abdominal wall pain (CAWP) is another kind of long-term, intermittent, abdominal pain in which the pain arises from the abdominal wall rather than from visceral organs, with minimal or no relationship to food intake or defecation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Functional gastrointestinal disorders: children and adolescents</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td align="left">H1.

</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Diagnosis</title><p id="Par7">The diagnosis and proper sub-classification of FGIDs is mostly clinical and based on the Rome IV criteria (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). According to the most recent criteria, FAP can generally be clinically diagnosed (i.e., without the requirement of additional diagnostic aids) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] when the physical examination of the child is overall normal and there are no alarming signs or symptoms. Compared with the Rome III criteria, a relatively new concept is that physicians no longer need to virtually exclude all the other organic causes of abdominal pain before making the diagnosis of FGIDs. Thus, in the new diagnostic criteria for each different group of FGIDs, the previous sentence &#x0201c;no evidence for organic disease&#x0201d; is replaced with the new &#x0201c;after appropriate medical evaluation the symptoms cannot be attributed to another medical condition&#x0201d; (see Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).<table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table&#x000a0;2</label><caption><p>Diagnostic criteria for different groups of abdominal pain-related functional gastrointestinal disorders</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td align="left">Functional dyspepsia<break/>&#x000a0;Functional dyspepsia has been defined by the Rome IV criteria and must include one or more of the following bothersome symptoms at least 4&#x000a0;days per month for at least 2&#x000a0;months before the diagnosis is made:<break/>&#x000a0;&#x000a0;1.

</p><p id="Par8">In diagnosing FAP, then, according to the new ESPGHAN guidelines, physicians are not obliged to perform numerous medical exams to virtually exclude any organic cause of abdominal pain but can choose to narrow the exams down to a few select tests and finally make the diagnosis. The cornerstone of the diagnosis is an accurate anamnesis: a detailed history about the abdominal pain and any other associated symptoms, including onset, duration, frequency, site, characteristics, and triggering or relieving factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Laboratory tests and radiological investigations are generally not mandatory for the diagnosis of FAP; they should be considered whenever concerns of an organic pathology must be ruled out or when, during the physical examination of the child, the physician recognizes some of the &#x0201c;red flag&#x0201d; signs. It is important to underline that sometimes FGIDs can coexist with other organic or other pathological medical conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]; therefore, in ambiguous cases or when concerns about IBS or other underlying gastrointestinal diseases arise, children should be referred to a pediatric gastroenterologist for further investigation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Management</title><p id="Par9">The review of the current literature on RAP does not highlight a unique effective strategy to treat the symptoms of this peculiar condition. The most important step is to make an absolutely correct diagnosis. If specific causes for the pain are discovered, then the management is specific and directed to treat them. When no organic causes and no alarming signs are found, the abdominal pain is then named functional pain (i.e., FAPS), but this does not mean the child does not need medical treatment to relieve symptoms. Children with FAPS frequently report significant limitations to life activities and may also manifest distinct psychopathologies, including depression, anxiety, and somatoform disorders. Moreover, parents of affected children are often very worried and obsessively seek health advice or painkiller prescriptions.</p><p id="Par10">As a specific cure is not possible, children with FAP should be evaluated and treated in a manner that includes a bio-psychosocial approach, thus engaging in a therapeutic patient&#x02013;physician partnership. Proper communication between the physician and both the child and their parents become mandatory to reassure that no serious underlying diseases exist but that the abdominal pain is fully recognized and accepted as a real disorder by the physician rather than being considered something that is &#x0201c;just in the head&#x0201d;. Sometimes, the mere acceptance of this psychosocial point of view of the illness could help greatly in the resolution of the functional abdominal pain.</p><p id="Par11">The treatment options can be classified as non-pharmacological, placebo, or pharmacological. Any therapeutic interventions should aim to reduce suffering and improve overall quality of life (QOL). The primary goal is to achieve complete remission of the symptoms; if this is not possible, then the abdominal pain and its exacerbated episodes should be minimized.</p><p id="Par12">Different aspects of behavioral habits of affected children, such as specific diet, gut microbiota, defecation pattern, stress, and psychosocial aspects of the illness, may represent targets of treatment on a case-by-case basis.</p><sec id="Sec5"><title>Non-Pharmacological Treatment Strategies</title><p id="Par13">Non-pharmacological therapies include (1) dietary modification, (2) probiotic supplementation, and (3) bio-psychosocial intervention.</p><sec id="Sec6"><title>Dietary Interventions</title><p id="Par14">Modification of the diet is one of the most commonly used strategies to approach a child with FGIDs and is usually happily accepted by both children and parents. Dietary intervention may involve excluding or reducing a specific ingredient or a group of foods from the diet, such as lactose; fructose; dairy products; fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAPs); and gluten, or even increasing the daily intake of other foods, such as fiber-rich food and water.</p><p id="Par15">Despite the very high number of possible dietary arrangement interventions, only a few large and concrete studies have investigated the role of diet in children with FGIDs. In summary, the current literature does not highlight concrete long-term effectiveness for reducing abdominal pain frequency and intensity, but in clinical practice, dietary interventions are often tried, and some children may truly benefit from excluding certain ingredients, especially when food allergies or intolerances are suspected or ascertained.</p><p id="Par16">Despite that various dietary intervention strategies have been successfully tested, data are not consistent enough to definitively recommend a specific diet regimen for children with FAPS.</p><sec id="Sec7"><title>Lactose and Fructose</title><p id="Par17">Lactose and fructose are considered substrates for bacterial fermentation and gas production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Malabsorption and intolerance to these carbohydrates may therefore cause bloating and osmotic diarrhea, thus resulting in abdominal pain.</p><p id="Par18">Several authors have reported an association between FGIDs and abnormal lactase activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. However, a series of studies investigating a lactose-containing diet compared with a lactose-free diet in children with FGID proved that, in most of the cases, a diet without lactose was not helpful, even in children with a positive hydrogen breath test (HBT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par19">Two prospective studies identified fructose malabsorption as a frequent cause of FAPD in children with unexplained chronic abdominal pain and positive HBT. In 2012, Wintermeyer et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] observed that abdominal pain in 75 children aged 3&#x02013;14&#x000a0;years resolved or greatly improved after following a fructose-restricted diet for 4&#x000a0;weeks. Escobar et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] confirmed the positive effect of a fructose-free diet on 222 children in 2014. Specifically, the conclusions of this trial were that fructose intolerance was present in 54% of the 222 children and that 76.9% of them reported the resolution of symptoms by adhering to a low-fructose diet (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.0001). Interestingly, in the same study, 55 of 101 patients (54.4%) with negative HBT reported resolution of symptoms without a low-fructose diet (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.37) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Moreover, Wirth et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] published a prospective blinded randomized intervention trial in 103 children in 2014, demonstrating that a fructose-restricted diet was efficacious in diminishing abdominal pain intensity and frequency, regardless of the result of the HBT.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>FODMAPs</title><p id="Par20">In addition to lactose and fructose, many other short-chain carbohydrates, grouped under the acronym FODMAPs, are believed to be poorly absorbed in the intestine and therefore considered a possible target for dietary intervention in children with FGIDs. The typical low-FODMAP diet is a two-phased intervention that consists of a 2- to 6-week complete elimination of all slowly absorbed or indigestible short-chain carbohydrates, followed by&#x02014;if symptoms have decreased substantially&#x02014;a structured reintroduction of specific FODMAPs, according to tolerance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. However, the efficacy of a low-FODMAP diet is well-established, but the success of maintaining this regimen for the long term, as for other similar dietary intervention, remains controversial and is currently under investigation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p id="Par21">Wheat is also considered to possibly induce bloating, changes in bowel habits, and abdominal pain. In non-celiac children, mechanisms involved in wheat-associated clinical effects could be the malabsorption of wheat carbohydrates and wheat proteins, such as FODMAPs and gluten, respectively. Non-celiac children and adults with unexplained abdominal pain who benefit from a gluten-free diet are often referred to as having a relatively new and still-controversial diagnosis of &#x0201c;gluten sensitivity&#x0201d;. We found no relevant studies that specifically tested the efficacy of a gluten-free diet compared with a low-FODMAP diet in non-celiac children with FGIDs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Elimination of Foods and Drugs</title><p id="Par22">Another example of a possibly useful dietary intervention is the elimination of foods and drugs that specifically are known to be avoided when gastro-oesophageal reflux and gastritis are suspected. Chocolate, caffeine, spicy and fatty foods; nitrite- and amine-containing foods; and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may trigger abdominal symptoms in children with FAPS. Several observational studies have proven the beneficial effects of avoiding these foods and drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Fiber</title><p id="Par23">The importance of the amount of fiber in the diet of children with FAPS is also controversial. A randomized, double-blind pilot study in 60 children (aged 8&#x02013;16&#x000a0;years) with FAP demonstrated that a particular type of fiber, called partially hydrolyzed guar gum (PHGG), may have beneficial effects on symptom control. The mechanisms involved seem to be modulation of the intestinal microbiota, similar to prebiotics, and normalization of stool frequency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Other small studies have demonstrated that a daily fiber intake below the minimum recommended value is possibly linked with RAP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. In contrast, a systematic review of the published RCTs on the effect of dietary fibers in children with FAP showed a lack of evidence that a fiber-enriched diet could greatly help relieve FGID-related pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Finally, the 2017 updated Cochrane review on dietary intervention for RAP in childhood reported that children treated with fiber-based interventions did not experience a great improvement in pain at 3&#x000a0;months post-intervention compared with children receiving placebo (odds ratio [OR] 1.83; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.92&#x02013;3.65; two studies; 136 children) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Probiotics Supplementation</title><p id="Par24">The human microbiota is estimated to be composed of more than 1&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;10<sup>14</sup> bacterial cells, ten times the number of human cells. The majority of the human microbiota lives inside the gastrointestinal tract, and several lines of evidence indicate that our intestinal microbes carry out the following very important functions: (1) enhancing gut barrier function; (2) inhibiting pathogen binding by binding themselves to small- and large-bowel epithelium and producing substances that inhibit the growth of other pathogenic organisms; (3) modulating the gut inflammatory response by modulating the gastrointestinal lumen towards an anti-inflammatory state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]; (4) reducing visceral hypersensitivity associated with both inflammation and psychological stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]; and (5) altering colonic fermentation by converting undigested carbohydrates into short-chain fatty acids and improving gut function.</p><p id="Par25">Numerous studies have suggested a strong association between modification of the intestinal microbiota and IBS, constipation, diarrhea, and FAP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Over time, several different strains of probiotics have been tested as potential treatments for children with FGID, with the most commonly used being Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria. In 2010, a daily dose of a probiotic prepared with strains of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> administered to 203 children aged 4&#x02013;18&#x000a0;years with chronic IBS resulted in a significant improvement of symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].

In gut-directed hypnotherapy, trained therapists induce a hypnotic state, and the child is guided to respond to suggestions towards control and normalization of gut functioning, stress reduction, and ego strengthening.

The latest and largest study was an RCT in 250 children aged 8&#x02013;18&#x000a0;years.

Behavioral procedures include the identification of verbal and non-verbal pain behavior and how family members, teachers, and caregivers react to it and are addressed by interventions such as physical exercise to promote relaxation, breathing exercises, and muscle relaxation techniques taught by trained therapists. Cognitive procedures may include stopping thoughts related to pain and replacing negative thoughts with positive ones; distracting oneself when pain arises (i.e., watching television or playing games, doing mental arithmetic); and using imagination to encourage the child to think about pleasant things when confronted with pain. The most recent RCT, based on a prospective, longitudinal trial in children and their parents, investigated the use of social learning and CBT, whether in person or by phone, and phone-based education and support. There were no results in regard to pain symptoms or QOL, but the social learning CBT showed that this method was capable of improving outcomes by changing the parental responses to children&#x02019;s pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. These results are in line with another study specifically addressing the mothers of children with FAP: A group of these children was treated with CBT, and the waiting list was used as the control group.

It can indeed coexist with one or both of these disorders or can predict their emergence in adult life. For this reason, antidepressant drugs have been tested as a possible treatment. Amitriptyline has proven efficacious in adults with IBS and FD. In low doses, amitriptyline is believed to work primarily by inducing pain tolerance through central or peripheral antinociceptive properties and anticholinergic effects. Its efficacy was evaluated in a total of 123 children in two double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trials. Bahar et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>] conducted a study with a duration of treatment of 8&#x000a0;weeks; the primary outcome measure was improvement of overall QOL, evaluated with a questionnaire. At baseline, differences in mean QOL scores between the two groups were borderline significant. Immediately and 3&#x000a0;weeks after treatment, significantly more children in the amitriptyline group reported at least a 15% improvement in QOL scores on almost all IBS-associated symptoms; however, interference with daily life and pain frequency and intensity did not differ between groups. No adverse effects were reported. In the study by Saps et al.

Thus, the therapeutic effects of amitriptyline demonstrated in adults are not confirmed in children. The results of the study by Bahar et al.

The primary outcome was self-reported change in frequency and intensity of abdominal pain; the global assessment of improvement was also measured. After 2&#x000a0;weeks of treatment, cyproheptadine proved superior to placebo in reducing/resolving pain, both in frequency (86.7% of children receiving cyproheptadine vs. 35.7% receiving placebo) and in intensity (86.7 vs. 28.6%). The global assessment of improvement reported by children was significantly better in the cyproheptadine group than in the placebo group (86.7 vs. 35.7%). Nonetheless, the results should be interpreted cautiously because of the very low methodological quality, the use of non-validated questionnaires, and the limited follow-up of 2&#x000a0;weeks. The retrospective open-label study by Rodriguez et al.

A placebo response is defined as the outcome caused by a placebo manipulation. However, it is important to make clear that this includes the &#x0201c;true placebo effect&#x0201d; and other factors, such as the natural course of the disease, spontaneous symptoms fluctuations, and regression to the mean [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. This high placebo response rate has important implications for both researchers and clinicians. In research, a high placebo response results in reduced assay sensitivity (i.e., the ability of a trial to detect true differences between active treatment and placebo), which may lead to inefficient trials. On the other hand, in clinical practice, the placebo response can be considered a valuable and powerful clinical tool [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>]. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis by Hoekman et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>] on 21 RCTs of children with FAPDs demonstrated pooled placebo rates of improvement and no pain of 41 and 17%, respectively. There was a significant association between lower dosing frequency and longer duration of treatment and a higher proportion of subjects with no pain on placebo. The association between lower dosing frequency (once daily instead of twice daily) and a higher proportion of subjects with no pain on placebo (29.9 vs. 10.6%, respectively) is in contrast with other studies, which found a higher placebo response rate correlated with a higher dosing frequency. This may be explained by arguing that a lower dosing frequency might indirectly reduce the focus of the child on their complaints and disease, which may lead to a greater decrease in their symptoms. The important study by Walker et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>] supported this suggestion: They found that children who were distracted from their complaints by their parents had a greater reduction in pain than children who received more attention for their symptoms. In contrast, other studies support an association between longer treatment duration and significantly greater placebo response and is probably because patients who are treated for longer may feel they are getting more treatment, which may increase their expectation of responding to treatment. Other studies on this subject have suggested that children and adolescents respond more than adults to placebo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>]. This contrasts with the results of Hoekman et al.

Other factors significantly associated with the absence of pain were a higher placebo dropout rate and a study with a statistically significant effect in favor of the active agent over placebo.

According to the Rome IV criteria, currently, a positive diagnosis of FAPD in children can be made without necessarily excluding every other possible cause of abdominal pain. Nevertheless, physicians may need to take some time and conduct some useful tests to make a proper diagnosis; this process is indeed mandatory, especially to exclude chronic gastrointestinal conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease or celiac disease, which may mimic the clinical picture of FAP, before commencing any sort of treatment.</p><p id="Par52">This review shows there is no agreement among experts on a universally proven management that will work on every child presenting with FAP. Treatment strategies include both non-pharmacological and pharmacological options. Non-pharmacological treatments are usually very well accepted by both children and their parents and are free from negative pharmacological side effects. Nevertheless, they may be as effective as the pharmacological interventions; therefore, according to many experts and based on the majority of current evidence, a non-pharmacological approach should be the first intervention attempt in children with FAPDs. In this review, the importance of the bio-psychosocial approach is highlighted, as most children will improve with counselling and reassurance that no serious organic pathologies are suspected, particularly when the physician establishes a trustful relationship with both children and their families. In our experience, constipation or abnormal defecation patterns are frequently involved and should be the target of interventions. Dietary modifications and probiotic supplementation could greatly improve abdominal symptoms, but it is recommended that dietary modifications (i.e., the exclusion of FODMAPs or other specific foods as well as fiber or guar gum supplementation) should be initiated and monitored by a specialist pediatric dietician to ensure adequate nutritional intake, particularly in small children. Placebo and pharmacological interventions both showed efficacy and could be attempted, especially in cases when the bio-psychosocial approach is not applicable or not efficacious. Our personal thought is that since the efficacies of placebo and pharmacological interventions showed comparable results in many RCTs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>], one may speculate that any kind of medication actually produces an organic effect in diminishing pain.</p><p id="Par53">However, in some difficult cases, finding an effective treatment for FAPDs could be a challenge, and several strategies may need to be tried before symptoms can be controlled.
