    "Purpose:The aim of this study was to describe functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGID) presented in a tertiary medical center, characteristics of patients and results of the diagnostic work-up together with an outcome during the follow up. Methods:This was a retrospective, single center, observational study including all patients who were diagnosed with FGID based on Rome III criteria from January to December 2015 in tertiary medical center. Results:Overall 294 children were included (mean age, 8.9 years [range, 1-18 years]; 165 females). Majority had functional constipation (35.4%), followed by functional abdominal pain (30.6%), irritable bowel syndrome (17.0%), functional dyspepsia (12.6%), functional nausea (3.4%) and abdominal migraine (1.0%). Regression model found that only significant factor associated with improvement of symptoms is the establishment of the functional diagnosis at the first visit (hazard ratio, 2.163; 95% confidence inverval, 1.029-4.544). There was no association between improvement of symptoms and presence of alarm signs/symptoms (weight loss, nocturnal symptoms and severe vomiting) at diagnosis. Furthermore, in pain symptoms (functional abdominal pain, irritable bowel syndrome, dyspepsia) no treatment positively correlated with pain improvement. Conclusion:Regardless of the initial diagnosis of FGID, positive diagnosis at the first visit increases a chance for resolution of symptoms."
