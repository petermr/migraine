Questionnaire items include the frequency, duration, and nature of the headache attacks, time from the start of the headaches to presentation at the clinic, and related symptoms. If a discrepancy arises between the reports of a child and his /her parent(s), the anamnesis is extended by requesting both the parent and the child to repeat the description of the headache episodes and other symptoms in greater detail. This also ensures that the child understands the questions. For very young children with limited verbal communication, headache frequency and symptoms are determined by the child&#x02019;s complaints and the parents&#x02019; impression from the child&#x02019;s behavior (according to the criteria of the ICHD-III beta version) For patients who were admitted before 2013, their medical files were reviewed and migraine was diagnosed according to the ICHD-III criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In addition, parents are questioned about their diagnosisgiven by of the parents&#x02019; community physician, their own medical history of migraine, and migraines in other family members (yes/no; diagnosed/not diagnosed by a physician). The final diagnosis in each case is only reached after extensive follow-up, with a review of all the findings of all the patient&#x02019;s visits at the headache clinic.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Study procedure</title><p id="Par13">Data on demographics, headache symptoms, and other clinical headache-related parameters were collected from the medical files of the patients who were found eligible to participate in the study.

Accordingly, more female patients were postpubertal at both time points; and had a higher rate of migraine with aura, greater migraine frequency, more chronic migraine, and a lower rate of vomiting.</p><p id="Par24">In a large study of 2982 adults aged 18&#x02013;65&#x000a0;years with migraine, female patients were found to be prone to a significantly longer duration of headaches and greater intensity of headache attacks than male patients, with a higher prevalence, frequency, and intensity of nausea; and a higher prevalence of phonophobia and photophobia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p id="Par25">W&#x000f6;ber-Bing&#x000f6;l et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] reported on the prevalence of migraine headache symptoms in children by gender and found that the female patients had a higher frequency of migraine with aura, as in our study, and a higher rate of vomiting than the male patients, contrary to our study. Additionally, the male patients had a higher rate of phonophobia, contrary to our study. However, the study of W&#x000f6;ber-Bing&#x000f6;l et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] was based on the original IHS criteria (ICHD1), whereas ours was based on the revised criteria for children of the ICHDIII-beta version. Furthermore, the age range in the earlier study was 3&#x02013;19&#x000a0;years and in ours, 3.8&#x02013;18&#x000a0;years.</p><p id="Par26">The differences observed in the current study in migraine parameters and in symptom frequency between males and females may have an anatomical basis. This assumption is supported by brain magnetic resonance imaging studies of adult and pediatric migraineurs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In both age groups, gender differences were noted in neural mechanisms in regions involved in sensory, motor, and affective functions, between male and female migraineurs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The authors also suggested that the observed changes might be attributable to differences in the response to intermittent stress (migraine attacks) or to differential effects of gonadal hormones (testosterone versus estradiol or progesterone) on hippocampal function and brain circuitry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par27">However, clinical gender-related differences in pain perception are less clear. A 2012 meta-analysis of 126 adult studies of pain perception conducted in 1998 to 2008 concluded that 10&#x000a0;years of laboratory research had not produced a clear and consistent pattern of gender differences in human pain sensitivity, even with the use of deep, tonic, long-lasting stimuli to mimic the clinic setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Additionally, no gender differences in pain perception results were found in pediatric studies of the perception of laboratory-provoked dental pain in children (mean age 6.7&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;2.4&#x000a0;years) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and of disease-related pain perception during acute attacks of sickle cell anemia in adolescents (median age 14.8&#x000a0;years) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. By contrast, in an evaluation of pain perception in 118 children and adolescents from grades 5 to 9, using the cold pressor task and a related pain questionnaire, Vierhaus et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] found that the female subjects had significantly higher pain intensity scores by both measures. The differences among the studies may be explained by the different ages of the populations and the different methodologies used, including differences in the study settings and in the questionnaires. Such factors may also account for the findings of more pronounced temporal summation, allodynia, and secondary hypoanalgesia in women in laboratory studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], and for the lack of a significant difference in the rate of allodynia by gender in our pediatric survey study. Although questionnaires have demonstrated reliability in this setting, differences in the diagnosis of allodynia may have contributed to the findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Overall, the evidence supporting a possibly less efficient endogenous pain inhibitory system in females is mixed and does not necessarily apply to all pain modalities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par28">In our study, no difference of psychiatric comorbidity was found between genders. Psychiatric comorbidity was associated with higher headache frequency and with a higher rate of migraine with aura. Gender differences in response to pain were evaluated with anxiety and pain questionnaires by Fuss et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] in a survey study of 1006 children aged 11.6&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;2.7&#x000a0;years; of whom 27% reported having an experience of pain that lasted 3&#x000a0;months or longer. Girls with a history of persistent pain expressed higher levels of anxiety sensitivity (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.001) and pain catastrophizing (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.001) than did both girls without a history of pain and boys, regardless of pain history. The authors concluded that boys and girls appear to differ in terms of the relationship between age and pain history, and in the expression of pain-related psychological variables [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec10"><title>Age of onset of migraine</title><p id="Par29">Estrogen per se is not a cause of migraine, as males have migraines too. In addition, the evidence of a decreasing prevalence of migraine-type headache after menopause supports the involvement of factors other than estrogen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Nevertheless, our finding that male patients presented earlier with migraine symptoms than did female patients is in line with the notion that estrogens, which modulate mediators and receptor systems in both the central nervous system and at the peripheral (neuro) vascular level, may act as a trigger for migraine presentation in females [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. For example, female sex steroids enhance neuronal excitability by elevating Ca2+ and decreasing Mg2+ concentrations; and these play a role in the synthesis and release of nitric oxide and of neuropeptides; and in the function of receptors inducing vasoconstriction. These mechanisms are involved in eliciting migraines and in stimulating pain centers, respectively. The serotonergic, adrenergic and &#x003b3;-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic systems are also modulated by sex steroids to varying degrees, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. We speculate that the difference between girls and boys in the age of onset of migraines may be related to the beginning of estrogen release and migraine modulation in girls.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Migraine diagnosis</title><p id="Par30">We found that migraine with aura was significantly associated with female gender, and migraine without aura, with male gender. Similar results were reported by W&#x000f6;ber-Bing&#x000f6;l et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The higher rate of aura in the females may be a consequence of their better neurocognitive abilities and higher verbal abilities, as observed in psychological and neuropsychological studies in adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. These factors, together with the older age of our female patients, would have made it easier for them to describe migraine aura.</p><p id="Par31">Aura may also be influenced by sex hormones. Studies of male and female mouse models of familial hemiplegic migraine type 1 suggest that estrogens increase susceptibility to cortical spreading depression, the pathophysiological mechanism underlying migraine aura [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. These findings correspond to reports of an increased prevalence of migraine with aura in high estrogen states, such as during the second and third trimester of pregnancy and hormone replacement therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. They are also in line with the significantly higher number of pubertal girls than boys in our cohort. In contrast, so-called estrogen withdrawal, which occurs perimenstrually, is associated with a higher prevalence of migraine without aura [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Accordingly, in our cohort, the rate of migraine with aura was significantly higher in pubertal females than in pubertal males. This finding was not true for prepubertal males/females.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Chronic migraine and headache frequency</title><p id="Par32">In our study, adolescent females had a significantly higher headache frequency and higher rate of chronic migraine than did adolescent males. Similarly, studies of adults reported a significantly higher recurrence rate of migraines among females than males [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], and an almost threefold higher prevalence of chronic migraine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Vomiting</title><p id="Par33">Vomiting in our pediatric cohort was observed at significantly higher rates in males than females, contrary to studies in adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Since the males in our study were younger than the females, we assume their relatively worse autonomic dysfunction contributed to this difference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Parental migraine</title><p id="Par34">Goodman and McGrath [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] showed that maternal modeling of pain behaviors affected their children&#x02019;s own pain. Although we did not ask about other pain conditions, we found no difference in the rate of paternal migraine between male and female patients. This could explain the between-group differences in clinical parameters.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Study limitations</title><p id="Par35">This study was limited by the retrospective design and the reliance on self- and parental reports of clinical parameters of migraine for young patients. Furthermore, the sample was restricted to patients treated in a tertiary medical center, who may have had more severe disease than individuals in the general population. This might explain the high frequency of migraine attacks and high rate of chronic migraine. Moreover, the uncovered associations might simply reflect referral patterns or other idiosyncrasies of our clinic, such as the physician&#x02019;s decision to refer a patient or a patient&#x02019;s agreement to attend the clinic. The study may also be biased due to differences in interpretations and expectations from parents regarding their children&#x02019;s behavior according to gender. Finally, a high proportion of parents failed to respond to the question on allodynia. Although there was no difference in the percentage of males and females for whom we were missing data on this matter, the overall lower number of patients may have lessened the power of the statistical analysis<bold>.</bold>
</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par36">Compared to male pediatric patients, female pediatric patients with migraines have a significantly higher rate of chronic migraine, a higher frequency of migraine with aura, older age of onset, a higher rate of onset after puberty, and a lower rate of vomiting. Some of these findings may be related to better verbal ability of females, which makes it easier for them to describe their symptoms and their pain. Estrogen levels may explain the higher rate of aura in pubertal (but not prepubertal) girls compared to boys. Further studies are needed in ambulatory settings to assess the generalizability of the findings.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>ICHD</term><def><p id="Par5">International classification of headache disorders</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IHS</term><def><p id="Par6">International headache society</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><p>The authors thank Ms. Pnina Lilos for her statistical assistance.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p id="Par37">No funding was procured for this work.</p></sec></ack><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>TEM designed, interpreted and collected the data, drafted the manuscript, revised it for intellectual content, and approved the final version.
