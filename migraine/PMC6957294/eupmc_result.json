    "BACKGROUND:Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy is used in the treatment of various diseases, and IVIG-related adverse effects (IVIG-AEs) vary from mild to severe. However, the mechanisms underlying IVIG-AEs and the potential predictive factors are not clear. This study investigated whether certain IVIG-AEs can be predicted before IVIG administration. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS:This retrospective cohort study at the Division of Neurology, Saitama Children's Medical Center included patients enrolled from 2008 to 2018 who were < 18 years old and received IVIG for the first time. IVIG-AEs were classified according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0. RESULTS:A total of 104 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The rate of IVIG-AEs was 37.5% (39/104). The most frequent IVIG-AEs were fever (41.0% [16/39]) and headache (38.5% [15/39]). AEs were below grade 2 in all except one patient and there were no grade 4 AEs. High serum total protein (TP) level was significantly related to the occurrence of IVIG-AEs (odds ratio, 14.8; 95% confidence interval, 2.4-90.5; P < 0.01). The optimal cutoff TP level was 6.7 g/dL. Although low WBC count and immunoglobulin G level may be predictive risk factors of IVIG-AEs, it was not confirmed in this study. CONCLUSION:IVIG-AEs occurred in 37.5% of cases, and most were mild. TP was the best predictive risk factor of IVIG-AEs before IVIG administration. These results may aid in elucidating the mechanism underlying IVIG-AEs."
