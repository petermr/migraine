    "Neurodevelopmental symptoms were previously believed to be a complication of celiac disease (CD) and rarely seen as presenting symptoms. One case has been reported so far where motor regression was the presenting symptom. We present a 16-month-old girl with postprandial vomiting and regression of motor skills. Examination revealed abdominal distension, hypotonia, and decreased motor movements in lower extremities. Celiac serology showed elevated tissue transglutaminase (tTG) immunoglobulin A (IgA) levels. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy with biopsies confirmed CD. Gluten-free diet led to the improvement of neurological and gastrointestinal complaints. We recommend keeping CD as one of the differentials in children with neurodevelopmental symptoms."
