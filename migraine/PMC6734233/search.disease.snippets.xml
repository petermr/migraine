  <result pre="with nausea, vomiting, and increased sensitivity to external stimuli. Chronic" exact="migraine" post="(CM) is a devastating subtype of migraine, which is"/>
  <result pre="as headache days of 15 or more per month and" exact="migraine" post="days of eight or more per month for &amp;gt; 3 months"/>
  <result pre="and results in a much higher disease burden than episodic" exact="migraine" post="(EM) [ 3]. About 3% of EMs progress to"/>
  <result pre="progress to CMs annually [ 4]. However, the pathophysiology of" exact="migraine" post="chronification is still unknown. Although epidemiological studies revealed risk"/>
  <result pre="promote the conversion of EM to CM, biological mechanism of" exact="migraine" post="chronification has not been fully elucidated yet, particularly in"/>
  <result pre="4, 5]. Therefore, it is likely that a predisposition to" exact="migraine" post="chronification exists. To elucidate this, researchers have investigated functional"/>
