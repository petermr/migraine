Abstract</div> <p id="Par1">We systematically reviewed data about the effect of exogenous estrogens and progestogens on the course of migraine during reproductive age. Thereafter a consensus procedure among international experts was undertaken to develop statements to support clinical decision making, in terms of possible effects on migraine course of exogenous estrogens and progestogens and on possible treatment of headache associated with the use or with the withdrawal of hormones. Overall, quality of current evidence is low. Recommendations are provided for all the compounds with available evidence including the conventional 21/7 combined hormonal contraception, the desogestrel only oral pill, combined oral contraceptives with shortened pill-free interval, combined oral contraceptives with estradiol supplementation during the pill-free interval, extended regimen of combined hormonal contraceptive with pill or patch, combined hormonal contraceptive vaginal ring, transdermal estradiol supplementation with gel, transdermal estradiol supplementation with patch, subcutaneous estrogen implant with cyclical oral progestogen. As the quality of available data is poor, further research is needed on this topic to improve the knowledge about the use of estrogens and progestogens in women with migraine. There is a need for better management of headaches related to the use of hormones or their withdrawal. </p> </div> <div class="kwd-group"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

Introduction</div> <p id="Par18">The role of female hormones in the pathogenesis of migraine is well-recognized [ <a href="#CR1">1</a>, <a href="#CR2">2</a>]. Migraine is more prevalent in women than in men, it usually starts after puberty and in many women improves during pregnancy and after the menopause [ <a href="#CR1">1</a>, <a href="#CR3">3</a>, <a href="#CR4">4</a>]. The menstrual phase of the female cycle represents a trigger for migraine attacks in many women [ <a href="#CR1">1</a>, <a href="#CR4">4</a>]. Additionally, exogenous hormones may change the course of migraine by inducing de novo migraine, inducing de novo aura, worsening previous migraine but also improving migraine particularly those attacks related to menstruation [ <a href="#CR5">5</a>, <a href="#CR6">6</a>]. </p> <p id="Par19">The criteria to diagnose migraine related to menstruation (Table <a href="#Tab1">1</a>) and to diagnose headache related to the use and to the withdrawal of hormones (Table <a href="#Tab2">2</a>) have varied over years [ <a href="#CR7">7</a>â€“ <a href="#CR10">10</a>]. The first version of the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD), 1988, did not report any formal criteria for migraine related to menstruation [ <a href="#CR7">7</a>]. The authors recognized that in some women, migraine without aura (MO) may be almost exclusively linked with menstruation, so called menstrual migraine (MM), and indicated that it seemed reasonable to require that 90% attacks should occur between two days before menses and the last day of menses. Appendix criteria for migraine related to menstruation were introduced in 2004, with the second edition of the ICHD (Table <a href="#Tab1">1</a>) [ <a href="#CR8">8</a>]. Two entities were recognised: pure menstrual migraine (PMM) where attacks are exclusively related to menstruation; menstrually related migraine (MRM) where attacks occur additionally at other times of the cycle. Both were forms of MO, along with non-menstrual MO or migraine with aura (MA) in the case of MRM. PMM with aura and MRM with aura are new entries in the Appendix of the classification system available since 2018 [ <a href="#CR10">10</a>]. <div class="table-wrap_UNKNOWN" id="Tab1"> <span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Table 1</span>  </div></p><p>Diagnostic criteria of migraine related to menstruation according to the different editions of the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD) </p>  <table frame="hsides" rules="groups"> <tbody> <tr> <td colspan="2">ICHD, II edition, 2004</td> </tr> <tr> <td colspan="2">â€ƒA.1.1.1 Pure menstrual migraine without aura</td> </tr> <tr> <td colspan="2">â€ƒâ€ƒA.

Headache attributable to hormones, both in the second and the third edition (beta) of the ICHD, could be diagnosed in the presence of either new onset headache or of worsening of pre-existing headache [ <a href="#CR8">8</a>, <a href="#CR9">9</a>]. Criteria also required resolution or return to the previous pattern after cessation of the hormones. A significant change was introduced in 2018 where the diagnosis of headache attributable to exogenous hormones requires the presence of headache for at least 15 days per month [ <a href="#CR10">10</a>]. At variance, the diagnosis of estrogen-withdrawal headache remained substantially unchanged over years and requires the onset of headache, in women who have been taking estrogens for three weeks or longer, within 5 days from estrogen withdrawal. However, evidence for the duration of treatment with estrogen before withdrawal headache occurs is lacking. </p> <p id="Par21">Several attempts were made to manipulate the female hormonal cycle to try to improve migraine [ <a href="#CR6">6</a>, <a href="#CR11">11</a>]. Studies have investigated both MO, MA and migraine attacks related to menstruation [ <a href="#CR6">6</a>, <a href="#CR11">11</a>]. Additionally, as in users of combined hormonal contraceptives (CHC) migraine attacks mostly occur during the hormone free interval, studies also evaluated how different estrogen or progestogen regimens impact on the course of migraine [ <a href="#CR12">12</a>â€“ <a href="#CR15">15</a>]. CHC have been associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke in women with migraine [ <a href="#CR16">16</a>â€“ <a href="#CR21">21</a>]. A working group including headache experts, gynaecologists, stroke experts, and epidemiologists developed a first consensus document about the safety of hormonal contraceptives (HCs) in female migraineurs of reproductive age [ <a href="#CR22">22</a>]. According to the recommendations of the European Headache Federation (EHF)/European Society of Contraception and Reproductive Health (ESCRH) consensus group, CHCs should not be used in all women with MA and women with MO who have additional risk factors. Progestogen-only hormonal contraceptives (PHCs) can be safely considered in this group of patients [ <a href="#CR22">22</a>]. Currently, no formal guidelines specifically address hormonal treatment of migraine. The aim of this consensus document is to provide recommendations on the management of migraine with the use of estrogens and progestogens in women of reproductive age. </p> </div> <div class="methods" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Methods</div> <p id="Par22">In July 2017, EHF representatives selected a panel of international multidisciplinary experts in migraine and hormonal contraception (HC). The panel was chosen to represent the breadth of knowledge and experience and a wide variety of opinions internationally. The aim of this statement is to provide evidence-based guidance to clinicians about evidence-based options for the management of migraine with exogenous estrogens and progestogens. </p> <div class="reviewoftheliterature" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Review of the literature</div> <p id="Par23">A systematic review of the literature was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines [ <a href="#CR23">23</a>]. We identified key papers on possible benefits of the use of estrogens and progestogens in migraine. An initial literature search included all papers indexed on PubMed and Scopus, from inception to October 23, 2017. The systematic literature search was repeated at the end of the consensus procedure to include all relevant papers published until May 2018. The following search string was used in both databases: "migraine AND (hormone OR estrog* OR progest* OR contracept*)". Two investigators independently screened the titles and abstracts of the publications identified to verify study eligibility. Literature screening was conducted in two steps. In the first step, studies were excluded after reading the title and the abstract for clear exclusion criteria. For studies that passed the first step, the full text was assessed to decide inclusion/exclusion. Disagreements were resolved by consensus. The reference lists and Google Scholar citations of the selected articles were also screened. The reasons for exclusion were recorded and summarized. To summarize the search results, a data extraction sheet was developed including the information of interest. Papers retrieved from the literature search as well as summary tables were shared among the panelists. </p> </div> <div class="dataextraction" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Data extraction</div> <p id="Par24">A general description of the study was extracted for each publication.

Whenever different studies referring to the same population of patients were available we included the study with the largest population or the longest follow-up. We excluded studies 1) with observational designs not reporting outcome before and after treatment or not comparing at least two treatment strategies; 2) using estrogen or progestogen that is no longer available or that is not considered a feasible strategy; 3) performed in post-menopausal women. </p> </div> <div class="qualityassessment" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Quality assessment</div> <p id="Par27">For each of the selected studies one author (SS) addressed the quality of evidence. The quality of evidence was addressed according to GRADE approach for single studies [ <a href="#CR24">24</a>]. Randomized trials were considered as high quality of evidence but their quality was downgraded in the case of study limitations such as lack of allocation concealment, lack of blinding, incomplete accounting for patients and outcome events, selective outcome reporting bias, or other limitations such as inadequate sample or lack of sample size calculation [ <a href="#CR25">25</a>]. Observational studies were considered as low quality of evidence but their quality was upgraded if large magnitude effects, dose-response gradient, if plausible confounding can increase confidence in the estimate or other considerations [ <a href="#CR26">26</a>]. </p> </div> <div class="developmentoftheexpertconsensus" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Development of the expert consensus</div> <p id="Par28">The consensus process was performed according to the Delphi method [ <a href="#CR27">27</a>]. Development of the consensus statement was organized in three rounds. In each round, panelists were instructed not to discuss among themselves and to send their feedback only to the facilitator (SS). Two core panelists (SS, PM) developed a draft document containing the statements. In round 1, the draft containing the statements was sent by e-mail to all panelists accompanied by a clear explanation of the objectives of the study and specific instructions. Panelists were asked to provide free-text comments to all the statements and to suggest additional items of relevance or questions to be answered. Thereafter, the facilitator analysed answers obtained during round 1 and drafted a revision version of the statements with additional items. In round 2, a further draft of the documents and of the statements was sent by e-mail to all panelists. Each panelist was asked to report their agreement for each statement and provide suggestions. Panelists were also given the opportunity to identify further additional items not included in the initial list of statements. Responses were then analysed by the facilitator and used to refine statements. In round 3, a revised draft of the document and of the statements was developed and emailed to all panelists and the panelists were asked again to revise and to express their agreement. The panelists were also required to provide a rank order of the statements. Response frequencies for each item were calculated and entered anonymously into a database. Statements to be included in the final document required at least 80% agreement from the panel. </p> </div> <div class="draftingofthestatements" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

Both treatment with the conventional and the shortened pill-free interval were associated with reduction in headache intensity and days of migraine as compared to baseline observation. Treatment with the shortened pill-free interval was associated with significantly greater reduction in the intensity and duration of MM as compared to 21/7 HC. Improvements were observed from the first cycle and increased over the study period.

Available studies are heterogeneous referring to adopted regimen and there is no evidence which may indicate superiority of one regimen over the other possibilities. Additionally, evidence mostly support the use of CHCs with shortened pill-free interval in women who need them for contraceptive or gynecological reasons. But there is not enough evidence to use this treatment solely for the management of migraine. The extended regimen is safe and not associated with significant adverse events, but it is important to note that some women with migraine may be particularly sensitive to hormonal administration and need to stop treatment because worsening of headache [ <a href="#CR43">43</a>]. It may be difficult to establish if the worsening is really related to treatment or rather to natural fluctuations in the migraine course nor it is clear if improvements can be observed with continuation of treatment.

Menstrual attacks occurred in 30.8% of the estradiol cycles and in 96.3% of the placebo cycles ( <i>P</i>â€‰&amp;lt;â€‰0.01). Attacks that occurred during estradiol treatment were considerably milder and shorter than those occurring during placebo treatment and were associated with less use of aspirin. One out of 20 patients had migraine three days after stopping estradiol treatment. </p> <p id="Par71">Dennerstein et al. performed a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, cross-over study in 22 women with MM [ <a href="#CR32">32</a>]. The diagnosis was not made according to ICHD criteria. The authors reported no difference in the occurrence of all attacks, but a reduction of moderate to severe intensity attacks. Overall there were no significant differences in the occurrence of migraines between pre- and post-treatment cycles. There was a significant difference in the occurrence of moderate to severe intensity migraine during the months of treatment with percutaneous estradiol compared with placebo gel ( <i>t</i>â€‰=â€‰2.67; <i>P</i>â€‰&amp;lt;â€‰0.05). As the authors considered that treatment would not be expected to affect migraine which occurred prior to or after the use of the gel, they performed a further analysis with these migraines omitted. They found that the alleviation of headaches by percutaneous estradiol compared with placebo was then significant ( <i>t</i>â€‰=â€‰3.96; <i>P</i>â€‰&amp;lt;â€‰0.001). Additionally, significantly less medication was utilized during percutaneous estradiol use, compared with placebo. </p> <p id="Par72">MacGregor et al. performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study in 37 women with PMM or MRM [ <a href="#CR35">35</a>]. The diagnosis was made according to ICHD-2 criteria. The authors reported a reduction in migraine days and attack severity. Estradiol was associated with a 22% reduction in migraine days per woman (relative risk [RR] 0.78; 95% CI 0.62 to 0.99). These attacks were also less severe ( <i>P</i>â€‰=â€‰0.03) and there was evidence that they were associated with less nausea, although this difference was not significant. However, in this study authors found an increase in migraine occurrence in the 5 days immediately following estradiol use compared to placebo (RR 1.40; 95% CI 1.03 to 1.92, Pâ€‰=â€‰0.03). Of the 22 women who benefited from using the estradiol gel (they had fewer migraines compared to using placebo), 15 experienced post-gel migraine (they had more migraine days during the 5 days after the estradiol gel compared to the 5 days after placebo). In this study a fertility monitor was used to predict menstruation and hence to indicate when to apply the gel. </p> <p id="Par73">In the available studies, no serious adverse events were reported associated with the use of estradiol gel. Some of the patients experienced cutaneous rash, anxiety, or amenorrhea. Estradiol use was also associated with an increase in the length of the follicular phase [ <a href="#CR35">35</a>]. </p> <p id="Par74">In conclusion, current evidence on the use of transdermal estradiol supplementation with gel in women with migraine is limited. Transdermal estradiol supplementation with gel is easy and well tolerated, thus offering considerable advantages over other strategies of estrogen administration. One challenge is to predict when to apply the gel especially in women with irregular menstruation. Fertility monitors may be useful but are not always practical in daily life. Possible benefits may be offset by an increase in migraine following gel use, associated with an iatrogenic delayed estrogen withdrawal. Possible reasons for the occurrence of post-gel estrogen withdrawal migraine are that the dose of estradiol was inadequate; the duration of treatment was too short; or perhaps that exogenous estrogen inhibits the follicular rise of endogenous estrogen. Extending the duration of use of estradiol supplements until endogenous estrogen had risen might prevent post-supplement estrogen withdrawal migraine. However, there is no evidence to support this strategy so far due to the paucity of data and the possibility of delayed migraine, estrogen supplementation cannot represent a first-line therapy in women with MM. However, this option may be considered when other strategies have failed or are not feasible. Women should be aware that delayed migraine may occur and in those circumstances treatment should be withheld. Recommendations for the transdermal estradiol supplementation with gel are reported in Table <a href="#Tab5">5</a>. </p> </div> <div class="transdermalestradiolsupplementationwithpatch" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Transdermal estradiol supplementation with patch</div> <p id="Par75">Four studies assessed the possible benefits of transdermal estradiol supplementation with patch in women with PMM [ <a href="#CR29">29</a>, <a href="#CR38">38</a>] or MM [ <a href="#CR33">33</a>, <a href="#CR37">37</a>]. Three studies were interventional [ <a href="#CR29">29</a>, <a href="#CR37">37</a>, <a href="#CR38">38</a>] and one was observational [ <a href="#CR33">33</a>]. The study drug was estradiol patch releasing from 25 to 100 Î¼g/24 h. In all the studies treatment was specifically prescribed for headache management. Details of the studies are reported in Table <a href="#Tab3">3</a>. The quality of evidence was rated as low for all the available studies (Table <a href="#Tab4">4</a> and Table <a href="#Tab6">6</a>). </p> <p id="Par76">Almen-Christensson et al. performed a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover study in 38 women with PMM [ <a href="#CR29">29</a>]. The diagnosis was made according to ICHD-2 criteria. The authors addressed as active treatment estradiol 100 Î¼g/24 h transdermal patch. The treatment was compared with placebo. Women started treatment 7 days before the estimated onset of menstrual bleeding and continued for two weeks; this was repeated for three consecutive menstrual cycles. The study was prematurely stopped because of difficulties in recruitment. Authors did not find any benefit in number, severity, and intensity of migraine attacks. </p> <p id="Par77">Guidotti et al. performed an observational, prospective, parallel group, open-label study in 38 women with MM [ <a href="#CR33">33</a>]. The diagnosis was made according to ICHD-2 criteria. The authors addressed as active treatments estradiol 25 Î¼g transdermal patch or frovatriptan or naproxen sodium. Each treatment was started 2 days before expected onset of menstrual headache and continued for 6 days for a single cycle. Authors reported that frovatriptan was associated with reduced migraine incidence and severity while they did not report benefits from transdermal estradiol. </p> <p id="Par78">Pradalier et al. performed a randomized, open-label study in 24 women with MM [ <a href="#CR37">37</a>]. The diagnosis was made according to ICHD-1 criteria. The authors studied two different doses of the estradiol patch (25 vs 100 Î¼g/24 h). There was 1 cycle of observation and 2 cycles of treatment. The authors found that the high dose was associated with no attacks or decreased number of attacks in 8/12 patients while the low dose was associated with no attacks or decreased number of attacks in 2/12 patients. MM occurred in 11/12 patients treated with the low dose and in 6/12 patients treated with the high dose. More patients used rescue treatments with the low dose (10 patients) than with the high dose (4 patients; <i>P</i>â€‰&amp;lt;â€‰0.05). </p> <p id="Par79">Smite et al. performed a randomized, placebo-controlled study in 20 women with PMM [ <a href="#CR38">38</a>]. The diagnosis was made according to ICHD-1 criteria. The authors addressed as active treatment estradiol 25 Î¼g/24 h transdermal patch. The treatment was compared with placebo. There were 6 days of treatment for each cycle (estradiol-placebo-estradiol or placebo-estradiol-placebo). The authors did not find any difference in presence, duration, and severity of migraine attacks and in the use of analgesics between active treatment and placebo. </p> <p id="Par80">Adverse events related to transdermal estradiol supplementation occurred in a variable proportion across studies and were not serious. They consisted of increased headache, local skin reactions, nausea, early bleeding and increased blood pressure [ <a href="#CR29">29</a>, <a href="#CR33">33</a>, <a href="#CR37">37</a>, <a href="#CR38">38</a>]. </p> <p id="Par81">In conclusion, current evidence on the use of transdermal estradiol supplementation with patch in women with MM or PMM is limited. As the aim of transdermal estradiol supplementation is to maintain estradiol concentrations stable at the time of the anticipated start of the bleeding and migraine attacks, dosing and timing of treatment are very important. Authors of the available studies pointed out that 25 and 50 Î¼g of estradiol supplementation may be too low to achieve clinical benefits whereas higher doses may increase risk of ischemic stroke [ <a href="#CR33">33</a>]. Also, duration of estradiol supplementation may impact on efficacy. Limitations of transdermal estradiol supplementation may also include difficulties in establishing the time of ovulation. As there are currently no data showing benefits of estradiol supplementation with patches on migraine occurrence, this cannot be considered as a possible therapeutic option.

Transdermal estrogen supplementation with patch in women with induced in pharmacological menopause </div> <p id="Par82">One study assessed the possible benefits of transdermal estrogen supplementation with patch in women with MO and MA, in whom a pharmacological menopause was induced [ <a href="#CR12">12</a>]. The study had an interventional design. Treatment was specifically prescribed for headache management. Details of the study are reported in Table <a href="#Tab3">3</a>. The quality of evidence was rated as high for this study (Table <a href="#Tab6">6</a>). The overall quality of evidence for the specific treatment was considered as low, because of evidence was not replicated by other studies. </p> <p id="Par83">Martin et al. performed a randomized, placebo controlled, parallel group study in 23 women with MO and MA [ <a href="#CR12">12</a>]. The diagnosis was made according to ICHD-1 criteria. All patients received a 3.6 mg goserelin implant to induce medical oophorectomy. Thereafter women were randomized to estradiol 100 Î¼g/24 h every 6 days vs placebo patches. The study was performed in the setting of headache and internal medicine clinic. There was a 2-month randomization period. The authors found a 34% improvement ( <i>P</i>â€‰=â€‰0.025) in the headache index, a 24% improvement ( <i>P</i>â€‰=â€‰0.003) in headache severity, and a 39% improvement ( <i>P</i>â€‰=â€‰0.035) in disability during treatment as compared to pre-treatment phase. No improvements were observed in women allocated to placebo. Adverse events were reported in 9 women and included urticaria, worsening depression, and worsening headaches. </p> <p id="Par84">In conclusion, evidence referring to the use of transdermal estradiol supplementation in women induced in pharmacological menopause is very limited, but a single study showed some benefits [ <a href="#CR12">12</a>]. This condition is associated with risk of osteoporosis, depression, irritability, hot flashes, decreased libido and vaginal dryness which however could be minimized by estrogen add-back therapy. Medical menopause associated with estradiol treatment is not appropriate for most women of reproductive age but future studies need to address its utility in women who have worsening of their headache during the perimenopause.

Subcutaneous estrogen implant plus cyclical progestogen</div> <p id="Par85">One study [ <a href="#CR36">36</a>] assessed a subcutaneous estrogen implants in women with MM. The study had an observational design. Treatment was specifically prescribed for headache management. Details of the study are reported in Table <a href="#Tab3">3</a>. The quality of evidence was rated as low (Table <a href="#Tab4">4</a>). </p> <p id="Par86">Magos et al. performed a retrospective, observational, cross-over study in 24 women with MM with and without aura [ <a href="#CR36">36</a>]. The diagnosis was not made according to ICHD criteria. Authors addressed as active treatment an estradiol implant (100 mg then decreased to 50 mg) plus norethisterone 5 mg/day for 7 days per month to induce menstruation. The implants were inserted in the subcutaneous fat of the lower abdominal wall. Patients were included in this study specifically to treat migraine after failure of previous treatments. Mean duration of treatment was 2.5 years. Pre- and post-treatment observation periods were not defined and authors did not provide any information about migraine frequency, severity or disability before and after treatment. No use of headache diaries was reported. In this study, all but one patient noted an improvement in their menstrual migraine following treatment. Eleven (46%) became completely headache-free and nine (37.5%) gained almost complete symptomatic relief. All these patients were able to reduce or stop previous therapy and considered the implant treatment to be the most effective. Three patients (12â€“5%) reported partial relief, and one patient (4%) gained no benefit. No adverse events or side effects were reported. </p> <p id="Par87">In conclusion, current evidence on the use of subcutaneous estrogen implants in women with MM is very limited. In women with MM, there are not enough data to assess if the use of the subcutaneous implants may improve migraine. The only available study did not provide information in a sufficient rigorous way to fully assess benefits and disadvantages of treatment. Due to the promising benefits reported by the single available pilot study, further data are needed to evaluate possible advantages related to treatment.

Discussion</div> <p id="Par88">Our systematic review revealed that available evidence referring to the use of estrogens and progestogens in women of reproductive age and their effect on migraine is limited. All the recommendations were based on low quality evidence. There is no evidence on how to manage women with headache attributed to the use of estrogens. The strength of recommendation was rated as low in all cases. Further, most of the contraceptive hormone strategies were evaluated in the gynecological setting in women who required estrogens and/or progestogens for contraception or medical reasons. Much more limited is the evidence on the use of those drugs in the headache setting in women who do not require them for gynecological reasons. </p> <p id="Par89">Available data, albeit very weak, indicate that the desogestrel 75 Î¼g /day pill is the option which may offer more evident benefit on migraine course. From a cardiovascular point of view in women with migraine it is also the safest form [ <a href="#CR22">22</a>, <a href="#CR46">46</a>]. The desogestrel pill may improve migraine frequency and severity in women with MA or MO not necessarily related to menstruation. However, it has been addressed only in women who required it for contraception or medical reasons and no studies specifically aimed to evaluate this drug as a specific therapeutic option for women with migraine is available. It is important to note that in some patient the desogestrel pill may worsen migraine or may be associated with new onset migraine. Unfavorable bleeding patterns are a common cause for cessation of treatment [ <a href="#CR6">6</a>]. </p> <p id="Par90">The extended regimen of CHC either oral or with the patch is a further strategy to consider in women with migraine. As compared to regimens with hormone-free intervals, this strategy appears more beneficial. However, even in this case data are preliminary and evidence is limited to women who require CHC for contraception or medical reasons. This option is not suggested for women with MA or for women with MO and additional vascular risk factors. Although no studies addressed specifically the issue, Panelists suggested trying this option for women with estrogen withdrawal headache, particularly those women already experiencing headache or migraine during the pill-free interval. Less certain is the option of a shortened pill-free interval. No eligible studies were found evaluating the effects of the conventional 21/7 oral CHC. This is probably because observational epidemiological studies indicated that this contraceptive method is associated with de novo occurrence of migraine or migraine worsening in a substantial proportion of female migraineurs, although no studies record whether the attacks occur during pill taking or during the pill-free interval [ <a href="#CR47">47</a>â€“ <a href="#CR50">50</a>]. It is important to note that migraine may improve in some patients with the use of oral CHC [ <a href="#CR51">51</a>], but unfortunately there are no tools or clinical features to predict the course of migraine after oral CHC initiation. </p> <p id="Par91">In women who have menstrual attacks of migraine during natural cycles, a therapeutic option may the administration of estradiol gel. However, this option may be associated with delayed headache and is feasible only in those who have predictable bleeding and predictable migraine. Estradiol supplementation with patches is a further possibility. However, as evidence referring to the optimal dose of the patch is unclear, it is not suggested. </p> <p id="Par92">In conclusion, this statement provides evidence-based and expert-agreed guidance to clinicians for the management of migraine with exogenous estrogens and progestogens. The available evidence is weak and further research in needed to clarify which are the best estrogens and progestogens options in women with migraine. Further studies should also establish whether the treatments discussed may be specifically applied to treat migraine in selected women. </p> </div> </div> <div class="back" title="back"> <div class="glossary" title="glossary"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
