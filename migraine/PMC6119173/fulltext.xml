Thereafter a consensus procedure among international experts was undertaken to develop statements to support clinical decision making, in terms of possible effects on migraine course of exogenous estrogens and progestogens and on possible treatment of headache associated with the use or with the withdrawal of hormones. Overall, quality of current evidence is low. Recommendations are provided for all the compounds with available evidence including the conventional 21/7 combined hormonal contraception, the desogestrel only oral pill, combined oral contraceptives with shortened pill-free interval, combined oral contraceptives with estradiol supplementation during the pill-free interval, extended regimen of combined hormonal contraceptive with pill or patch, combined hormonal contraceptive vaginal ring, transdermal estradiol supplementation with gel, transdermal estradiol supplementation with patch, subcutaneous estrogen implant with cyclical oral progestogen. As the quality of available data is poor, further research is needed on this topic to improve the knowledge about the use of estrogens and progestogens in women with migraine. There is a need for better management of headaches related to the use of hormones or their withdrawal.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Migraine</kwd><kwd>Headache</kwd><kwd>Estrogens</kwd><kwd>Progestogens</kwd><kwd>Hormonal contraceptives</kwd><kwd>Contraception</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par18">The role of female hormones in the pathogenesis of migraine is well-recognized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Migraine is more prevalent in women than in men, it usually starts after puberty and in many women improves during pregnancy and after the menopause [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The menstrual phase of the female cycle represents a trigger for migraine attacks in many women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Additionally, exogenous hormones may change the course of migraine by inducing de novo migraine, inducing de novo aura, worsening previous migraine but also improving migraine particularly those attacks related to menstruation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par19">The criteria to diagnose migraine related to menstruation (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) and to diagnose headache related to the use and to the withdrawal of hormones (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>) have varied over years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The first version of the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD), 1988, did not report any formal criteria for migraine related to menstruation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The authors recognized that in some women, migraine without aura (MO) may be almost exclusively linked with menstruation, so called menstrual migraine (MM), and indicated that it seemed reasonable to require that 90% attacks should occur between two days before menses and the last day of menses. Appendix criteria for migraine related to menstruation were introduced in 2004, with the second edition of the ICHD (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Two entities were recognised: pure menstrual migraine (PMM) where attacks are exclusively related to menstruation; menstrually related migraine (MRM) where attacks occur additionally at other times of the cycle. Both were forms of MO, along with non-menstrual MO or migraine with aura (MA) in the case of MRM. PMM with aura and MRM with aura are new entries in the Appendix of the classification system available since 2018 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Diagnostic criteria of migraine related to menstruation according to the different editions of the International Classification of Headache Disorders&#x000a0;(ICHD)</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td colspan="2">ICHD, II edition, 2004</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">&#x02003;A.1.1.1 Pure menstrual migraine without aura</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">&#x02003;&#x02003;A.

Headache attributable to hormones, both in the second and the third edition (beta) of the ICHD, could be diagnosed in the presence of either new onset headache or of worsening of pre-existing headache [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Criteria also required resolution or return to the previous pattern after cessation of the hormones. A significant change was introduced in 2018 where the diagnosis of headache attributable to exogenous hormones requires the presence of headache for at least 15&#x000a0;days per month [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. At variance, the diagnosis of estrogen-withdrawal headache remained substantially unchanged over years and requires the onset of headache, in women who have been taking estrogens for three weeks or longer, within 5&#x000a0;days from estrogen withdrawal. However, evidence for the duration of treatment with estrogen before withdrawal headache occurs is lacking.</p><p id="Par21">Several attempts were made to manipulate the female hormonal cycle to try to improve migraine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].

According to the recommendations of the European Headache Federation (EHF)/European Society of Contraception and Reproductive Health (ESCRH) consensus group, CHCs should not be used in all women with MA and women with MO who have additional risk factors. Progestogen-only hormonal contraceptives (PHCs) can be safely considered in this group of patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].

We identified key papers on possible benefits of the use of estrogens and progestogens in migraine. An initial literature search included all papers indexed on PubMed and Scopus, from inception to October 23, 2017. The systematic literature search was repeated at the end of the consensus procedure to include all relevant papers published until May 2018. The following search string was used in both databases: &#x0201c;migraine AND (hormone OR estrog* OR progest* OR contracept*)&#x0201d;. Two investigators independently screened the titles and abstracts of the publications identified to verify study eligibility. Literature screening was conducted in two steps. In the first step, studies were excluded after reading the title and the abstract for clear exclusion criteria. For studies that passed the first step, the full text was assessed to decide inclusion/exclusion. Disagreements were resolved by consensus. The reference lists and Google Scholar citations of the selected articles were also screened. The reasons for exclusion were recorded and summarized. To summarize the search results, a data extraction sheet was developed including the information of interest.

Whenever different studies referring to the same population of patients were available we included the study with the largest population or the longest follow-up.

Two core panelists (SS, PM) developed a draft document containing the statements. In round 1, the draft containing the statements was sent by e-mail to all panelists accompanied by a clear explanation of the objectives of the study and specific instructions. Panelists were asked to provide free-text comments to all the statements and to suggest additional items of relevance or questions to be answered. Thereafter, the facilitator analysed answers obtained during round 1 and drafted a revision version of the statements with additional items. In round 2, a further draft of the documents and of the statements was sent by e-mail to all panelists. Each panelist was asked to report their agreement for each statement and provide suggestions. Panelists were also given the opportunity to identify further additional items not included in the initial list of statements. Responses were then analysed by the facilitator and used to refine statements. In round 3, a revised draft of the document and of the statements was developed and emailed to all panelists and the panelists were asked again to revise and to express their agreement. The panelists were also required to provide a rank order of the statements. Response frequencies for each item were calculated and entered anonymously into a database.

These attacks were also less severe (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.03) and there was evidence that they were associated with less nausea, although this difference was not significant. However, in this study authors found an increase in migraine occurrence in the 5&#x000a0;days immediately following estradiol use compared to placebo (RR 1.40; 95% CI 1.03 to 1.92, P&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.03). Of the 22 women who benefited from using the estradiol gel (they had fewer migraines compared to using placebo), 15 experienced post-gel migraine (they had more migraine days during the 5&#x000a0;days after the estradiol gel compared to the 5&#x000a0;days after placebo). In this study a fertility monitor was used to predict menstruation and hence to indicate when to apply the gel.</p><p id="Par73">In the available studies, no serious adverse events were reported associated with the use of estradiol gel. Some of the patients experienced cutaneous rash, anxiety, or amenorrhea. Estradiol use was also associated with an increase in the length of the follicular phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].</p><p id="Par74">In conclusion, current evidence on the use of transdermal estradiol supplementation with gel in women with migraine is limited. Transdermal estradiol supplementation with gel is easy and well tolerated, thus offering considerable advantages over other strategies of estrogen administration. One challenge is to predict when to apply the gel especially in women with irregular menstruation. Fertility monitors may be useful but are not always practical in daily life. Possible benefits may be offset by an increase in migraine following gel use, associated with an iatrogenic delayed estrogen withdrawal. Possible reasons for the occurrence of post-gel estrogen withdrawal migraine are that the dose of estradiol was inadequate; the duration of treatment was too short; or perhaps that exogenous estrogen inhibits the follicular rise of endogenous estrogen. Extending the duration of use of estradiol supplements until endogenous estrogen had risen might prevent post-supplement estrogen withdrawal migraine. However, there is no evidence to support this strategy so far due to the paucity of data and the possibility of delayed migraine, estrogen supplementation cannot represent a first-line therapy in women with MM. However, this option may be considered when other strategies have failed or are not feasible. Women should be aware that delayed migraine may occur and in those circumstances treatment should be withheld.

As the aim of transdermal estradiol supplementation is to maintain estradiol concentrations stable at the time of the anticipated start of the bleeding and migraine attacks, dosing and timing of treatment are very important. Authors of the available studies pointed out that 25 and 50 &#x003bc;g of estradiol supplementation may be too low to achieve clinical benefits whereas higher doses may increase risk of ischemic stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Also, duration of estradiol supplementation may impact on efficacy. Limitations of transdermal estradiol supplementation may also include difficulties in establishing the time of ovulation. As there are currently no data showing benefits of estradiol supplementation with patches on migraine occurrence, this cannot be considered as a possible therapeutic option.

This condition is associated with risk of osteoporosis, depression, irritability, hot flashes, decreased libido and vaginal dryness which however could be minimized by estrogen add-back therapy.

In women with MM, there are not enough data to assess if the use of the subcutaneous implants may improve migraine.

All the recommendations were based on low quality evidence. There is no evidence on how to manage women with headache attributed to the use of estrogens. The strength of recommendation was rated as low in all cases. Further, most of the contraceptive hormone strategies were evaluated in the gynecological setting in women who required estrogens and/or progestogens for contraception or medical reasons. Much more limited is the evidence on the use of those drugs in the headache setting in women who do not require them for gynecological reasons.</p><p id="Par89">Available data, albeit very weak, indicate that the desogestrel 75 &#x003bc;g /day pill is the option which may offer more evident benefit on migraine course. From a cardiovascular point of view in women with migraine it is also the safest form [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. The desogestrel pill may improve migraine frequency and severity in women with MA or MO not necessarily related to menstruation. However, it has been addressed only in women who required it for contraception or medical reasons and no studies specifically aimed to evaluate this drug as a specific therapeutic option for women with migraine is available. It is important to note that in some patient the desogestrel pill may worsen migraine or may be associated with new onset migraine. Unfavorable bleeding patterns are a common cause for cessation of treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par90">The extended regimen of CHC either oral or with the patch is a further strategy to consider in women with migraine. As compared to regimens with hormone-free intervals, this strategy appears more beneficial. However, even in this case data are preliminary and evidence is limited to women who require CHC for contraception or medical reasons. This option is not suggested for women with MA or for women with MO and additional vascular risk factors. Although no studies addressed specifically the issue, Panelists suggested trying this option for women with estrogen withdrawal headache, particularly those women already experiencing headache or migraine during the pill-free interval. Less certain is the option of a shortened pill-free interval. No eligible studies were found evaluating the effects of the conventional 21/7 oral CHC. This is probably because observational epidemiological studies indicated that this contraceptive method is associated with de novo occurrence of migraine or migraine worsening in a substantial proportion of female migraineurs, although no studies record whether the attacks occur during pill taking or during the pill-free interval [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. It is important to note that migraine may improve in some patients with the use of oral CHC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>], but unfortunately there are no tools or clinical features to predict the course of migraine after oral CHC initiation.</p><p id="Par91">In women who have menstrual attacks of migraine during natural cycles, a therapeutic option may the administration of estradiol gel. However, this option may be associated with delayed headache and is feasible only in those who have predictable bleeding and predictable migraine. Estradiol supplementation with patches is a further possibility. However, as evidence referring to the optimal dose of the patch is unclear, it is not suggested.</p><p id="Par92">In conclusion, this statement provides evidence-based and expert-agreed guidance to clinicians for the management of migraine with exogenous estrogens and progestogens. The available evidence is weak and further research in needed to clarify which are the best estrogens and progestogens options in women with migraine.
