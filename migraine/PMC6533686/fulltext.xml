There are several possible migraine triggers in a patient&#x02019;s environment, which should be avoided where possible.</p><p id="Par2">The objective of this Austrian monocentric study was to identify migraine triggers and the areas, in which children and adolescents with migraine have a lower quality of life than healthy, headache-free children.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par3">In this cross-sectional, questionnaire study, 76 children from ages 8 to 17&#x02009;years were included. Thirty-seven were classified as migraineurs, 39 as non-migraineurs. Participants filled in a questionnaire surveying the areas of physical, socio-economic and school functioning. Migraineurs further answered migraine-specific questions.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par4">The study included 33 (43.4%) males and 43 (56.6%) females. Median age was 13.00 (10.00&#x02013;16.00) years. Average age of onset for migraine was 9.22&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;3.34&#x02009;years. Non-migraineurs skipped trendwise fewer meals (p.adjust&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.108) and exercised more often (p.adjust&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.108). In socio-economic functioning, the father&#x02019;s nationality being Austrian might be related to migraine (p.adjust&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.108). Children with migraine had a significantly lower quality of life in school functioning (PedsQL 4.0 questionnaire, p.adjust&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.04) and had significantly less often &#x0201c;good&#x0201d; grades than children without migraine (p.adjust&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.048).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par5">Children with migraine show a reduced quality of life in the areas of physical, socio-economic and school functioning.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Migraine</kwd><kwd>Quality of life</kwd><kwd>Children</kwd><kwd>Adolescents</kwd><kwd>Physical</kwd><kwd>Emotional</kwd><kwd>Social</kwd><kwd>Economical</kwd><kwd>School</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par13">Migraine is categorised as primary headache disorder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], which is divided into &#x0201c;migraine without aura&#x0201d;, a clinical syndrome characterised by a pulsating headache and associated symptoms of nausea, vomiting, photophobia, phonophobia as well as motion sensitivity and &#x0201c;migraine with aura&#x0201d;, consisting of transient focal neurological symptoms, mostly visual or sensory, which precede or accompany the headache [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Migraine can develop at all ages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], and affects 7.7 to 9.1% of children and adolescents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par14">Population based studies have identified a number of physical and emotional triggering factors, which can induce a migraine attack. Physical factors that can trigger migraine are age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], comorbidities (i.e. atopic disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], food intolerances and allergy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], sleep disorders (sleep walking, sleep talking, nightmares, bruxism) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]), caffeine consumption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], skipping meals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], alcohol consumption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], immobility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], weather [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], noise, menstruation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] and smoking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The effect of daily fluid intake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and use of digital media is questionable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Emotional factors include emotional stress from family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] or general unhappiness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], but also psychiatric disorders, such as depression and anxiety, as reviewed in an article by Bicakci [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Social factors that influence migraineurs are having fewer friendships compared to their siblings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], furthermore the risk of migraine is increased by lack of empathy during headache attacks from parents, family quarrel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] as well as high expectations from parents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Further factors are sexual or emotional abuse (bullying) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], unfair treatment by teachers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] and low economic status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. School stress is the biggest predicator for migraine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. In children with migraine absenteeism is increased, whilst school performance is reduced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Severity, duration and frequency of migraine attacks can cause poorer performance in school [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p><p id="Par15">With regard to these data it becomes obvious that migraine affects already pediatric patients in various areas of their lives.

Ethical approval was applied for and granted by the local ethics committee of the Medical University of Vienna (1210/2016). Participants for this study were recruited in a Viennese pediatric outpatient clinic, the &#x0201c;First Vienna Pediatric Medical Center,&#x0201d; and were asked to fill in the questionnaire after giving written consent.</p><p id="Par21">Children and adolescents diagnosed with migraine, 8 to 17&#x02009;years of age, being under regular medical treatment at the pediatric outpatient clinic were asked to participate in this study. Age- and sex-matched pediatric patients, who do not suffer from migraine were enrolled in this study as control group. These healthy controls were pediatric patients, also recruited at the First Vienna pediatric medical center, who were at the practice due to health control check-ups, vaccinations or due to acute infections but without headache. Participants included as &#x0201c;migraineurs&#x0201d; had to fulfil the ICHD-3 beta criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] of migraine. Exclusion criteria were other primary headaches or secondary headaches. Two types of questionnaires were handed out to the participants and asked to be filled in: (1) Questionnaire for children from 8 to 12&#x02009;years of age, who could accept their parents support in filling in the questionnaire. (2) Questionnaire for adolescents from 13 to 17&#x02009;years of age, which has some additional, age-typical questions and could be completed independently. The reason for a separate questionnaire for teenagers was on the one hand chosen due to questions regarding puberty and on the other hand due to the validated PedsQL&#x02122; questionnaire, which was also designed for children either younger or older than 13&#x02009;years. At least 90% of the questionnaire had to be filled, for the questionnaire to be included into the evaluation. Data from other sources, such as health records or other medical results were not used for this study. Furthermore, written consent from participants of all ages and their parents was required.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Questionnaire</title><p id="Par22">The questionnaire is essentially designed by the author of the study. One part was used directly from the &#x0201c;Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory&#x0201d; (PedsQL&#x02122;) questionnaire, version 4.0 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], which has been validated and demonstrated good reliability in healthy and ill children and infants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. The permission for use of the PedQL&#x02122;4.0 questionnaire was obtained from Mapi Resarch Trust in February 2016.</p><p id="Par23">The designed part is a survey of: (1) migraine features, (2) migraine triggering factors, based on results of earlier studies, (3) the influence of migraine on the patient&#x02019;s life.</p><p id="Par24">The part of &#x0201c;school functioning&#x0201d; contains questions directly from the &#x0201c;PedsQL 4.0&#x0201d; questionnaire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. The German-Austrian version 07/01 of the PedsQL&#x02122;, version 4.0 child-report for children (8&#x02013;12&#x02009;years) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] and teens (13&#x02013;18&#x02009;years) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] was used, taking only the questions for &#x0201c;school functioning&#x0201d;, which are 5 items in total. All other dimensions of the PedsQL&#x02122;, which includes 23 items, covering in addition to school functioning, physical (8 items), emotional (5 items) and social (5 items) dimensions were not used for this survey. The items of school functioning are scaled on a 5- point Likert Scale from 0 (never) to 4 (almost always). Items are then reversely scored and linearly transformed to a scale from 0 to 100 (with 0&#x02009;=&#x02009;100 and 4&#x02009;=&#x02009;0). The mean score is calculated from the sum of items over the number of items answered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].

These variables were: age, age group, gender, meal skipping, parental (maternal, paternal) nationality, appreciation and pressure. Modelling assumes risk factors do not interact. A box-Tidwell test was executed to confirm a linear relationship between the dependent and independent variables. Variables were then tested for binomial logistic regression: First, &#x0201c;Omnibus-Test&#x0201d; (&#x003c7;<sup>2</sup>-test) was examined for statistical significance.

In literature, data on characteristics, triggering factors and impact of migraine on quality of life are based on epidemiological population studies. However, as far as we know this is the first report on pediatric migraine patients in an Austrian cohort. To identify the impact of the disease on the patients&#x02019; quality of life with regards to physical and socioeconomic functioning we conducted a monocentric, cross-sectional questionnaire study on children and adolescent migraine patients and compared the results to age and sex-matched healthy non-migraineurs. Due to the monocentric approach, only 76 pediatric patients were enrolled in this study, which might explain some of the non-significant results being in contrast to reports in literature, such as a possible association of migraine and gender or age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].</p><p id="Par94">In our study, we observed the most incisive effects of migraine on school performance and physical activity. School per se is not only a migraine triggering factor, but school performance is negatively correlated with the intensity of migraine, resulting in a lower average grade in migraineurs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Migraineurs had a significantly reduced quality of life in the PedsQL&#x02122; 4.0 questionnaire and significantly less often stated having &#x0201c;good&#x0201d; grades at school compared to non-migraineurs. Further, more than a third of migraine patients thought that their grades would be better without migraine, about 20% having headache attacks occurring concomitant with school tests. In line with our results, several other studies found a significantly lower quality of life in migraineurs compared to non-migraineurs (PedsQL&#x02122; 4.0) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. It may be hypothesized that migraine mostly affects the area of school functioning, as especially severe migraine attacks may disable patients, sometimes for days, which renders accomplishing school tasks impossible.</p><p id="Par95">With regard to physical functioning, our migraine patients exercised less often 3 or more times per week than non-migraineurs, which was accompanied by an impaired ability for physical exercising due to migraine in one third of migraineurs and which might be explained by the assumption that exercise might trigger a migraine attack [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Spending less time with sports seemed to be associated with migraine in some studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>], even though others could not find any significant relation in physical inactivity and migraine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Interestingly, the spare time migraineurs had due to reduced exercising time was not spent with digital media, although migraineurs tended to spend more time with their mobile phones than non-migraineurs. Bektas et al. found that migraineurs invested less time in TV watching and computer playing than non-migraineurs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Whether or not this might be due to digital media as migraine trigger remains questionable and implies the need of additional studies on this topic in future.</p><p id="Par96">Physical health of migraineurs is also affected with regards to dietary habits. A study by Bektas et al. confirms our results that migraineurs skip meals more often [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Other groups also reported on fasting and hunger as migraine triggers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. This, however, was discussed controversially by other authors, who could not detect a correlation of migraine with students skipping meals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. A link between fasting, i.e. skipping meals, and migraines may be suspected, as paediatric migraineurs have reduced appetite compared to non-migraineurs, possibly provoked by physical (nausea in attack) or emotional reasons. Other factors promoting migraine attacks in our patients included most commonly weather conditions, noise and stress, but also cinema, clubbing and concerts. Stress and lack of sleep seemed to be the most common trigger factors in other studies, followed by noise and excitation, intense visual stimuli, such as visual fixation, lights and video games and weather [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. It may be hypothesized that migraine is triggered by intense changes of physical factors in the environment, as well as the effect of stress on the patient&#x02019;s body. Adolescent migraineurs might consider reducing or refraining from alcohol consumption when going out as alcoholic beverages trigger migraine attacks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>], even if the relation between migraine and alcohol is controversially discussed in literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p id="Par97">Finally, migraine influenced socio-economic areas in our patients. Interestingly, a relationship between father&#x02019;s nationality and migraine was observed, as children with migraine had Austrian fathers significantly more often, which however was not found for maternal nationality. While Singh et al. described migraine prevalence to be significantly higher in children with native-born, non-Hispanic white parents than those with Hispanic, immigrational background [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>], Bugdayci et al. reported on a higher headache prevalence in immigration families [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Therefore, assuming a relation between paternal nationality and migraine is questionable and needs to be addressed in future studies in more detail. Not only the parental nationality background but also educational and socio-economic status of the family might influence migraine in children. Parents with a low educational level have more often children with headaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], while family&#x02019;s living space is not correlated with a higher headache prevalence. Our study did not obtain a significant result on paternal education or residence (Vienna or other federal state) and size of living space. Families are the major source of aid in an attack for migraineurs, who do not lack appreciation or are pressurized from the social environment. That this is not the case for other populations is underlined by contradictory results in literature. Some migraineurs felt a subjective lack of support by their siblings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>] and had significantly reduced scores in social relationship compared to healthy children, having a lower ability to communicate in school and social environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Whether there is an association between social relationships and migraine is hard to assess, due to conflicting outcomes from literature.</p><p id="Par98">The main limitation of this study was the relatively small sample size, which however was based on the single center design of this study and which might be the explanation for some of the non-significant results. A larger number might have produced more significant results. In addition, the questionnaire itself may have addressed too many variables, as it tried to cover a lot of areas simultaneously. The phrase &#x0201c;headache&#x0201d; as a synonym for &#x0201c;migraine&#x0201d; was problematic, as a lot of healthy children did not recognise questions including this phrase as &#x0201c;migraine-specific&#x0201d; questions. Additionally, as young children and adolescents might not have understood all of the questions correctly and as their parents might reflect the children&#x02019;s well-being and quality of life differently than the child experiences this might lead to a reporting bias. To minimize this bias, the authors assisted the families in filling in the questionnaire in those cases, where ambiguity existed. The recommendations to future researchers would be: (1) to focus on only one area of functioning to carve out key aspects of the variables, (2) to clarify misleading phrases and descriptions, (3) to enlarge the sample size.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par99">In this Austrian cross-sectional questionnaire study, pediatric migraineurs appear to have a reduced quality of life in physical, socio-economic and school functioning, compared to healthy children. Most prevalent migraine triggers were weather, stress, noise, alcohol, cinema, clubbing and concerts. In general, migraine triggers and implications of migraine on areas of life are controversially reported on in population-based studies. The non-significant results of our data might be partially explained by the small sample size, which is based on the monocentric approach of this study. However, our results implicate that pediatric migraine patients do not only need special medical attendance but support in other areas of life.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>ADHD</term><def><p id="Par6">Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ICHD</term><def><p id="Par7">International classification of headache disorders</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IQR</term><def><p id="Par8">Interquartile range</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>OCD</term><def><p id="Par9">Obsessive-compulsive disorder</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PedsQL&#x02122;</term><def><p id="Par10">Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SD</term><def><p id="Par11">Standard deviation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>tTGA- antibodies</term><def><p id="Par12">Tissue transglutaminase antibodies</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><p>We would like to acknowledge Christopher Hughes for his support in statistical analysis of the data.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p id="Par100">This study was not subject to any third-party funding.</p></sec><sec id="FPar2" sec-type="data-availability"><title>Availability of data and materials</title><p id="Par101">The datasets used and analysed in the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.</p></sec></ack><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>L-SK was responsible for questionnaire design, data acquisition, analysis and preparation of the manuscript.
