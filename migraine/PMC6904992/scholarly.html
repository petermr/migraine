There has been little study of treatments for mild TBI (mTBI) or PTH, and clinicians often use drugs approved for primary headache disorders. Many patients self-treat with OTC agents or NSAIDs but have </p> <p id="Par2">suboptimal pain relief. We initiated a randomised, double-blind (DB), sham-controlled, parallel-group pilot study of non-invasive vagus nerve stimulation (nVNS) for acute and preventive treatment of PTH. </p> <p id="Par3"> <b>Methods:</b> The study is enrolling adults who present 1-4 wks after a head injury, meet ICHD-3 criteria for acute headache attributed to mTBI, and have â¥2 headaches/wk with a migraine or probable migraine phenotype. After a 2-wk run-in period, subjects will be randomly assigned (1:1 allocation) to receive daily preventive therapy and as-needed acute treatment with nVNS or a sham device. Preventive therapy will consist of two 120-second stimulations given 3 times daily. Acute treatment will comprise 2 stimulations administered at headache onset, followed by 2 stimulations given 20 min after the start of initial treatment. Subjects are not to use acute rescue medication for 120 min post-treatment. The primary effectiveness endpoint is the decrease in pain (on a 7-point numeric scale) at 60 min post-treatment for all treated headache attacks. Secondary endpoints include decrease in the frequency of headache days between the run-in period and the last 2 wks of the DB period and responder rates (ie, percentages of subjects with â¥50% decrease in attack frequency). The primary safety endpoint is the incidence of treatment-related serious adverse events. </p> <p id="Par4"> <b>Results:</b> Up to 80 subjects will be enrolled at 1 North American site. The expected duration is 12 mos (9 mos for enrolment, 14 wks for active participation). </p> <p id="Par5"> <b>Discussion:</b> This study is designed to assess the efficacy and safety of nVNS as a novel acute and preventive therapy for PTH. </p> <p id="Par6"> <b>Author Disclosures</b> </p> <p id="Par7"> <b>B.

However, results from previous studies were challenged due to methodological issues. We performed quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM), a state-of-art MRI technique, to measure iron content in patients with refractory chronic migraine. </p> <p id="Par14"> <b>Methods</b>: We recruited patients with refractory chronic migraine and age-sex-matched headache-free controls. Using a 3T MR scanner, QSM were obtained from a conventional multi-echo gradient-echo sequence. Caudate nucleus, globus pallidus externa (GPe), globus pallidus interna (GPi), red nucleus, substantia nigra, and periaqueductal gray were manually segmented for each participant. Susceptibility values and R2* values of segmented areas were calculated and compared between groups. Wilcoxon signed-rank test was applied to test the paired group difference. </p> <p id="Par15"> <b>Results:</b> A total of 10 patients with refractory chronic migraine and 10 age-sex-matched headache-free controls were recruited. Total susceptibility values were not different between groups in caudate nucleus, GPe, GPi, red nucleus, substantia nigra, and periaqueductal gray. Mean susceptibility values were not different in all segmented regions but GPe, where patients showed decreased values than controls (p=0.009). R2* values were also not different between groups. </p> <p id="Par16"> <b>Conclusion:</b> Using QSM, we found that brain iron content is not increased in patients with refractory chronic migraine. Pathophysiology of chronic migraine may not be associated with iron metabolism or irreversible damage to specific nuclei. </p> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="a03typicalmigraineaurawithoutheadacheinkoreanheadacheclinic" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

The reported prevalence of typical aura without headache is different one from another ranging 0.2-6.5%. The prevalence and characteristics of Korean patients with typical aura without headache are not known. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence and characteristics of typical aura without headache in Korean Headache Clinic. </p> <p id="Par18"> <b>Methods:</b> The types of aura and headache followed by aura were analyzed in 214 patients with typical aura at the Headache Clinic of Eulji Hospital from 2010 to 2018. We diagnosed migraine with typical aura according to the diagnostic criteria of International Classification of Headache Disorders. </p> <p id="Par19"> <b>Results:</b> All the patients have visual aura. Twenty-four (11.2%) patients have other types of aura (sensory aura in 8.4% and aphasic aura in 7.5%). Typical aura without headache was observed in 15.0% (32 patients, with a male:female of 1:1.7 and a median age of 35 years) of migraine with typical aura. Among them, 25% (8/32) have typical aura without headache only (pure form) and other patients have both typical aura without headache and typical aura with headache. Typical aura without headache group was older than typical aura with headache group (median age of 28 years) </p> <p id="Par20"> <b>Discussion:</b> These data suggest that pure typical aura without headache is a rare migraine subtype in headache clinics in Korea. </p> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="a04factorsreducingdepressivesymptomsindepressedmigrainepatients" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

A total of 604 patients were found. Among them, we included patients who had depression at an initial visit (T1) and who could be followed at 12 weeks (T2). All patients conducted the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) at two periods. We stipulated that 8 or more of the PHQ-9 score suggest depression. We examined factors to be associated with the decrement of the PHQ-9 score during 12 weeks. </p> <p id="Par25"> <b>Results</b> </p> <p id="Par26">A total of 502 patients were excluded in the review due to having no depression (n=398) at T1 and no visit at T2 (n=104). Finally, 102 depressed patients were included in the study. Of them, 24 patients (23.5%) had medication overuse headache (MOH) and 36 (35.3%) received psychiatric drugs including antidepressants and anxiolytics. All took preventive drugs at T2. Mean score of the PHQ-9 at T1 was significantly decreased at T2 ( <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001). Mean difference of the PHQ-9 score was correlated with MOH and mean differences of attack frequency, headache day, and the VAS score by univariate analyses.

Participants reported headaches, sleep, and health habits on daily electronic diaries and wore actigraphs for 6 weeks. Migraine was defined by ICHD-3 criteria and diagnoses were reviewed by clinicians. Sleep measurements included total sleep time, sleep efficiency (proportion of sleep/rest period) and wake after sleep onset (minutes awake from sleep onset until wake time, WASO).

Short or disturbed sleep is associated with lowering of pain thresholds, although the majority of studies have been limited to individuals without headache. Our aim was to assess whether self-reported sleep characteristics in those with migraine and TTH in a population-based sample were associated with increased pain sensitivity. </p> <p id="Par34"> <b>Methods:</b> A sample of 644 adult individuals underwent a headache interview (using ICHD criteria) and completed a questionnaire that included four items on sleep (self-reported duration, sleeping problem, snoring and feeling well-rested). A total of 314 participants also underwent concurrent pain testing, including a pericranial total tenderness score (TTS), and cephalic and extracephalic pressure pain thresholds (PPTs). Data were analyzed using adjusted logistic or linear regression. </p> <p id="Par35"> <b>Results:</b> The sample was comprised of 40.9% headache sufferers (22.8% migraine, 17.1% TTH), of whom 12.5% had chronic headache (CH). Compared to non-headache sufferers, those with headache were more likely to report a sleep problem [OR=2.8(1.7-4.5)] and not feeling well-rested [OR=3.0(2.1-4.4)]. There was no difference in average sleep duration or snoring. TTS, but not PPTs, was higher in those with sleep problems and this difference was greater for CH (26.7, p=0.014) than for EH (19.1, p=0.051) compared to controls (14.0, ref). Similar results were found for those not well rested, with a higher TTS in those with CH (25.3, p&amp;lt;0.001) and EH (19.5, p=0.015) compared to controls (12.0, ref). </p> <p id="Par36"> <b>Conclusion:</b> Migraine and TTH are associated with higher rates of self-reported sleep problems and feeling unrested. TTS indicates increased pain sensitivity among those who report more sleep problems and this difference is greater for those with CH. Causal sequence cannot be determined in cross-sectional data. Future work is needed to determine if disturbed sleep modifies pericranial tenderness contributing to overall headache burden. </p> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="a07painextentisnotrelatedtowidespreadpressurepainsensitivityinmenwithepisodicclusterheadache" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

Widespread pressure pain hypersensitivity is a clinical manifestation of sensitization of central pain pathways which has been observed in other primary headaches such as migraine or tension type headache. The aim of this study was to investigate the presence of pressure pain sensitivity within trigeminal (symptomatic) and extra-trigeminal (pain-free) areas in a sample of men with episodic cluster headache. <b>Methods</b>: Forty men with episodic cluster headache and 40 matched controls participated. Pressure pain thresholds (PPT) were bilaterally assessed over one trigeminal point (i.e., temporalis muscle), one extra-trigeminal points (i.e., C5/C6 joint), and two distant points (i.e., second metacarpal and tibialis anterior muscle) by an assessor blinded to the subjectâs condition. Patients were assessed in a remission phase, at least 1 month from the last cluster attack and without taking preventive medication. <b>Results</b>: The analysis found that PPTs were significantly decreased bilaterally over the trigeminal (mean difference: 85-93 kPa), extra-trigeminal (62-79 kPa), and distant (second metacarpal: 72-92 kPa; tibialis anterior: 135-155 kPa) points in men with cluster headache when compared to healthy controls (all, P&amp;lt;0.001). No significant association between widespread PPTs and clinical headache features was found. <b>Conclusions</b>: Our findings revealed bilateral widespread sensitivity to pressure pain in men with episodic cluster headache during a remission phase. These results support the presence of sensitization of central pathways in episodic cluster headache although individuals were asymptomatic (remission phase) and without medication. </p> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="a09observational,open-label,non-randomizedstudyontheefficacyofonabotulinumtoxinainthetreatmentofnummularheadache:seriesof38patients:" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

Her complaint started as a tingling sensation and became progressively more and more intense until turning into a burning and swelling sensation. The sensations were constant, worsened by speaking and reduced during the night. We first prescribed a medical therapy (pregabalin and a supplement drug containing vitamins B1, B6, E and Î±-lipoic acid). After, the patient underwent a massive facial MR and, later, a brain contrast enhanced (CE) MR. Finally, she underwent a neurosurgical consult, a radiotherapic one and cyberknife intervention. </p> <p id="Par46"> <b>Results</b>: neurological examination was irrelevant, symptoms decreased just a little after medical therapy. The basic massive facial MR showed only an intrasellar arachnoidocele. The following brain CEMR showed an extracranial vascularised formation at the level of left cerebellopontine angle (coronal diameter 13x12mm, axial one 16.7x16.4mm), with marked dural contrast enhancement and associated to compression of the origin of left trigeminal nerve and Gasserâs ganglion. Neurosurgeon suggested to consult a radiotherapist, who set two options: watchful waiting or performing cyberknife intervention; our patient chose the latter option (25Gy in 5 fractions) with a reduction of symptoms (no more swelling sensation and no speech worsening), but persistence of paraesthesias. </p> <p id="Par47"> <b>Discussion</b>: cerebellopontine angle tumours may cause trigeminal neuralgia, but such painful condition is usually brief, intense and electric shock-like. In our case, the meningioma is probably the cause of such particular clinical presentation and cyberknife intervention may have reduced tumour dimensions, soothing symptoms.

Method: The research sample is divided in two groups: the research group, which consists of 31 migraine patients (10 of them having migraine aura) that fulfill the diagnostic criteria of the ICHD-3 beta version, and the control group, which consists of 30 healthy subjects, matched by age and education years. In this research design, neuropsychological tests are used for the assessment of cognitive functions, while scales and questionnaires are used for the collection of demographic and clinical data. Results: Statistical analyses show that the performance of migraineurs and especially of those without aura in interictal stages is significant lower than the group of healthy subjects in the tasks of Immediate, Delayed Recall and Memory Recognition of the Rey Complex Figure Test (RCFT) and MoCA. In contrast, they score higher than healthy controls in the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). However, after controlling for the effect of MoCA on the results no main effect of migraine aura is found. Conclusions: In interictal stages migraineurs and especially migraineurs without aura exhibit significant lower performance scores compared to a group of healthy controls in neuropsychological tests of visual memory recall and recognition. However this relationship is fully mediated by the performance scores in MoCA, which indicates a lower status of general cognitive function in that group.

Migraine is at the seventh place among the more disabling disorders. It is very important for specialists to have an adequate training for the management of headaches. The increasing development of social networks and in general of digital instruments led us to implement our project of a digital platform only focused on headaches, started in 2014 with the technological support of an industrial sponsor (Janssen). We monitored the activity of the platform in the following years, publishing some works (1-3) that emphasized its strengths and weaknesses. The aim of the current study is to analyze strengths and limits of a digital platform in headache training after 5 years. </p> <p id="Par66"> <b>METHODS:</b> Our platform is totally free and easily accessible to doctors after registration and approval of the groupâs administrators. It is possible to access using website or smartphone app. It is divided in a section for pediatric and a section for adult headaches and contains more than 270 resources totally concerning headache. Each member can download or upload contents and discuss clinical cases. Users can choose to receive notifications for each new contribution via email. We have also created a WhatsApp group to alert members about new contributions and to encourage real-time communication. Administrators can follow the membersâ activity (number of access, trend topics, uploaded/downloaded resources, discussions, average download for user). We monitored the evolution of the platformâs activities over time and compared our experience with other digital platforms. </p> <p id="Par67"> <b>RESULTS:</b> To this day the section dedicated to adult headaches includes 60 members and each did 14 downloads on average. The section dedicated to pediatric headaches includes 67 members with average of 19 downloads. We highlighted a progressive increase in the number of users since the start of our project and an increase in the number of downloads simultaneously with upload of new resources. The items that most capture the attention are PowerPoint presentations and resources closely related to common clinical cases or with short reading time. Below the top ten of the downloaded articles: <div class="table-wrap_UNKNOWN" id="Taba"> </div></p><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"> <tbody> <tr> <td>Resource</td> <td>Downloads</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Headache treatment PowerPoint</td> <td>72</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Article: When to investigate headache</td> <td>69</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Master in headache PowerPoint</td> <td>48</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Migraine aura videos</td> <td>37</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Innovation in migraine</td> <td>36</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Continuum neurology</td> <td>36</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Dysphagia and neuromuscular disease PowerPoint</td> <td>31</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Secondary headaches PowerPoint</td> <td>29</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Group IV headaches (according to ICHD III) PwP</td> <td>23</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Secondary headaches algorithm</td> <td>22</td> </tr> </tbody> </table>  <p /> <p id="Par68">The data collected during this monitoring period also showed that the number of uploads remains low and appears considerable the difference with the number of downloads. Most of the resources were uploaded mainly by the administrator (about 90%) and by a few other users (5 users). In general there are few discussed cases and the activity of the platform members appears to be considerably reduced during the summer months. Even the Whatsapp group has not significantly increased the number of active members. Finally, there is not a great difference in activity between specialists enrolled in a scientific society dedicated to headaches and those enrolled in other societies (neurologists, childhood neuropsychiatrists). </p> <p id="Par69">Some of these data are quickly summarized in the following chart, in which the blue dot indicates the total number of downloads and the red dot indicates the total number of uploads in that month: </p> <p id="Par70"> <b>CONCLUSIONS</b>: The increase in subscriptions shows that our social network dedicated to headaches is appreciated by the scientific community. Nevertheless, the activity does not appear equally increased (same average of downloads and uploads per member during these years, a slight increase in the number of active members) and a considerable number of members very rarely access the platform. We observed a paradoxical contrast between the increasing interest on this instrument (exponential increase of subscription to platform for headaches) and its consequent poor use by the registered specialists. There is no difference in its use between headache specialists and other specialists. Furthermore, on average the number of uploads is remarkably lower than downloads, indicating passive use of the platform. </p> <p id="Par71">In the other platforms, discussions and downloads are considerably less than the number of subscribers, similarly to the activity of our platform. These results confirm the potential but also the limits of digital instruments in the training for specialists, both in headaches and in other disorders. </p> <p id="Par72">In order to improve the functionality of our platform, a total renewal of the graphic interface is already in place, which will make it even easier and more pleasant to use. Future perspectives could be the use of typical tools of social networks such as the possibility of writing posts even without uploading content and adding reactions to the interventions of other users, the creation of a chat that allows the creation of live discussion groups or the interaction with other platforms. </p> <p id="Par73"> <b>References</b> </p> <p id="Par74">1.

Its negative equivalent, nocebo refers to the development of adverse events (AEs) from the administration of an inert substance and it is very prevalent among treatments for neurological disorders, resulting in low adherence and poor treatment outcome. </p> <p id="Par82"> <b>Objective</b>: To estimate the incidence of placebo and the incidence and severity of nocebo responses in clinical trials of monoclonal antibodies against the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) pathway for episodic (EM) and chronic migraine (CM) and compare them to those of topiramate and onabotulinum toxin A as standard treatments for EM and CM, respectively. </p> <p id="Par83"> <b>Methods</b>: We conducted a systematic Pubmed and <a href="http://clinicaltrials.gov">clinicaltrials.gov</a> search for all randomised, placebo controlled, phase 3 trials of anti-CGRP monoclonals, topiramate and onabotulinum toxin A. A meta analysis of the frequency of placebo effect was performed by pooling the percentage of placebo-treated patients who had at least 50% reduction from baseline in migraine days per month. Meta- analysis of the incidence of nocebo responses was performed by pooling the percentage of placebo-treated patients that exhibited any adverse event. Nocebo severity was calculated from the percentage of placebo-treated patients that exhibited any serious adverse events (SAE) and the percentage of placebo-treated patients that dropped-out due to AEs. </p> <p id="Par84"> <b>Results</b>: The pooled estimate for placebo frequency was 30% (95% CI: 24.1 - 36) in EM trials and 24.1% (95% CI: 11.1 - 37.2) in CM trials of anti-CGRP monoclonal, whereas the pooled placebo frequency in topiramate trials in EM was estimated to be 24.2% (95% CI: 19.5 - 28.8). </p> <p id="Par85">The pooled estimate of incidence of nocebo responses was 59.6% (95% CI: 57.2 - 62) in anti-CGRP trials for EM. The pooled serious nocebo responses and the pooled estimate of drop-outs due to nocebo were 1.5% (95% CI: 1.0 â 2.0) and 1.5% (95% CI: 0.7 - 2.2), respectively in anti CGRP trials for EM. On the other hand, the pooled incidence of dropouts due to nocebo in topiramate trials in EM was 9.2% (95% CI: 7 â 11.5). </p> <p id="Par86">The pooled estimate of incidence of nocebo responses in CM trials of anti-CGRP agents was 51.1% (95% CI: 37.9 â 64.4) and the pooled serious nocebo responses and the pooled estimate of drop-outs due to nocebo were 0.9% (95% CI: 0.4 - 1.4) and 1.1% (95% CI: 0.3 â 1.8), respectively. In onabotulinum toxin A trials in CM, the overall nocebo frequency was 51.6% (95% CI: 42.1-61.1), the pooled serious nocebo response and drop-out frequency due to nocebo were 2.3% (95%CI: 1.2 -3.4) and 0.7% (95%CI: 0.1 â 1.3). </p> <p id="Par87"> <b>Conclusions:</b> </p> <p id="Par88">Placebo responses in anti-CGRP monoclonal trials are average and comparable to those seen in topiramate trials.

To explore the aforementioned 3 conditions in migraine development, we investigated differences in whole brain resting-state functional connectivity (FC) between patients with and without these conditions. <b>Methods:</b> Sixty-two women with migraine underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging during the interictal phase. We compared resting-state FC between subjects with and without photo-, phono-, or osmophobia using region of interest to region of interest analysis of 91 cortical, 15 subcortical, and 26 cerebellar areas. <b>Results:</b> The patients with photophobia showed a higher connectivity between the vermis 9 (ver9) and bilateral (bil) intracalcarine cortex (IC)/bil cuneal cortex (cuneal)/bil lingual gyrus (LG)/bil supracalcarine cortex, as well as the right (r) cerebellum (cereb) 4-6 between the r cuneal and left (l) amygdala/l accumbens/r paracingulate gyrus. Photophobia patients also demonstrated higher connectivity between the l cuneal and l amygdala, as well as a lower connectivity between the ver9 and l angular gyrus than did patients without photophobia. The patients with phonophobia demonstrated a higher connectivity between the l cereb8-9 and bil cereb6/r temporal occipital fusiform cortex (TOFusC), between the ver9 and bil cereb6/l TOFusC/l inferior temporal gyrus/l superior temporal gyrus, between the r IC and l supramarginal gyrus, and between the l amygdala and l parahippocampal gyrus, as well as a lower connectivity between the cereb7-8 and r middle frontal gyrus/r aTOFusC than did patients without phonophobia. Finally, the patients with osmophobia demonstrated a higher connectivity between r cereb6 and the brainstem than did those without osmophobia. <b>Discussion:</b> Our results suggest that the cerebellum plays a key role in the relationship between photo-, phono-, and/or osmophobia and neural FC, particularly in migraine development. </p> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="a17anti-calcitoningene-relatedpeptidemonoclonalantibodies:adverseeffects.wheredowestand?" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

A 54.2% had medication overuse (MO), 27.5% with aura and a 70.3% presented anxiety.

At month 6, excellent response was associated with daily frequency patients with MO (p&amp;lt;0.01) and higher migraine days/month rate (p&amp;lt;0.05). At month 12, clinical predictors of excellent response were patients with less years of migraine evolution (p&amp;lt;0.01) and the presence of anxiety and aura (p&amp;lt;0.05).

Among these, 2042 of these patients were diagnosed as episodic migraine and 1227 had chronic migraine at first visit. 68 patients undergoing follow-up at least two visits, transformed chronic migraine and compared to others. Demographic, clinic, phenotypic, epigenetic factors were compared between chronics and other patients. Statistical analysis was performed accordingly. </p> <p id="Par125"> <b>Results:</b> The results showed there is a statistically significant relationship between chronicity and vertigo (p=0.007), cranial autonomic symptoms (p=0.037) and allergy (p=0.026). Co morbidity of allergy in migraine patients with chronic is 7.624 times higher than the episodic migraines. In addition, osmophobia (p=0.017), comorbid concomitant Diabetis Mellitus (p=0.016), coronary artery disease (p=0.025) and headache triggered by hunger (p=0.001) were observed to be more prevalent in episodic migraine. </p> <p id="Par126"> <b>Conclusion:</b> The study results showed that the presence of vertigo, cranial autonomic symptoms, concomitant allergy were effective in the chronicity of migraine with requires much more attention to migraine comorbidities associated rather than diagnostic peculiarities, not only for diagnosis but also for defining coping options. </p> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="a22long-termefficacyandsafetyoferenumab:resultsfrom64weeksofthelibertystudy" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

It is a widespread disorder both in episodic and chronic form. Chronic headache often leads to a high use/overuse of symptomatic drugs; indeed, medication overuse headache (MOH) occurs in over half of chronic headache patients, with significant management difficulties. </p> <p id="Par141"> <b>Objective:</b> to provide data about symptomatic drug (NSAIDs and triptans) consumption in an outpatient population of the Health District of Pavia, and describe how the clinical picture may change after being taken over by headache experts. </p> <p id="Par142">Materials and Methods: 276 patients using symptomatic drug for headache were recruited in 32 pharmacies. A telephonic interview was carried out in 199 of them. Data collection included sociodemographic characteristics and features of headache and drug consumption/abuse. Patients underwent 4 visits: a baseline visit (T0) and 3 follow-up visits performed by a neurologist at 3, 6 and 12 months (T3, T6 and T12, respectively). During each visit, patients underwent a complete neurological assessment and received therapeutic adjustments aimed at obtaining a proper management of headache. </p> <p id="Par143"> <b>Results:</b> Patients with chronic migraine or MOH were 16% and 12%, respectively, at the telephonic interview. After 12 months of follow-up, we observed a significant decrease in the frequency of attacks (T0: 9Â±9/month vs T12: 2Â±2/month; p&amp;lt;0.001), in the days/month of headache (T0: 11Â±9 vs T12: 4Â±4; p&amp;lt;0.001), and in the duration of the single attack (T0: 34Â±30 hrs vs T12: 10Â±19 hrs; p&amp;lt;0.001). The improvement of headache management resulted in both a significant decrease in the analgesic consumption per month (T0: 12Â±16 vs T12: 4Â±6 doses/month; p=0.014), and an increase in the quality of life, scored by MIDAS and HURT (p&amp;lt;0.001). </p> <p id="Par144"> <b>Conclusion:</b> This study shows that a proper medical management is more effective than self-treatment of headache, resulting in lower disability and improved quality of life within a few months from taking-over by headache specialists.

Headache is the most common complaint, and it can occur after mild, moderate, or severe </p> <p id="Par181">injury. Several researchers have reported that post-traumatic headache is more common after mild TBI than after severe TBI - in patients who sustained a loss of consciousness. However, International Classification of Headache Disorders diagnostic criteria for post-traumatic headache attributed to mild head injury does not distinguish between loss of consciousness and no loss of consciousness, but rather include both "no loss of consciousness," and "a loss of consciousness of &amp;lt; 30 minutes." The purpose of this study was to determine if there was an association between loss of consciousness (regardless of duration) and the development of chronic post-traumatic headache. </p> <p id="Par182"> <b>Methods</b> </p> <p id="Par183">A retrospective chart review was undertaken of new patients at a tertiary headache center with the diagnosis of chronic post-traumatic headache from 2013-2018. Physician documentation was examined for loss of consciousness at the time of the trauma. If the physician did not document loss of consciousness or maintenance of consciousness the patient was not included in this study. </p> <p id="Par184"> <b>Results</b> </p> <p id="Par185">A total of 180 patient charts contained documentation regarding consciousness at the time of </p> <p id="Par186">the trauma. Loss of consciousness was reported in 68 cases, and no loss of consciousness was reported in 112 patients. We ran a Chi Square of the data using The Statistical Package for the Social Sciences to determine the asymptotic significance of 0.001. This result suggests that there is only a 0.1% chance of no relationship between loss of consciousness and chronic post- traumatic headache. </p> <p id="Par187"> <b>Discussion</b> </p> <p id="Par188">In our study of patients with chronic post-traumatic headache, 62% of the patients did not lose consciousness during and after trauma compared with 38% who lost consciousness at the time of the trauma. There is an association between loss of consciousness and the development of chronic post-traumatic headache. In our study patients were more likely to develop chronic post- traumatic headache if there was no loss consciousness at the time of the trauma. This is consistent with most of the current literature that suggests mild TBI leads to post-traumatic headache more often than severe TBI. Given that mild TBI includes both "no loss of consciousness" and "loss of consciousness of &amp;lt; 30 minutes," however, we believe that our research is novel because of the distinction between loss of consciousness and no loss of consciousness. This suggests that no loss of consciousness may be a risk factor for the development of chronic post-traumatic headache. It is likely that other factors, such as anxiety </p> <p id="Par189">or depression, may represent even greater risk for the development of this condition. Areas for future research include assessing the association of anxiety or depression, together with or without loss of consciousness and the development of chronic post-traumatic headache. </p> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="a27apossiblerolefor2-aginthe" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

Medication overuse (MO) is considered by many as one of the main determinants of migraine progression. Recently, in a preliminary study, we have shown alterations of anandamide metabolism in circulating peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of migraineurs with a gradient of gravity from the episodic to the chronic type. </p> <p id="Par192">In this study we further investigated the asset of the endocannabinoid system (ES) in migraine as a function of disease severity. </p> <p id="Par193"> <b>Methods</b> </p> <p id="Par194">Using rt-PCR we essayed the gene expression of the enzymes involved in the metabolism of 2-Arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), sn-1-specific diacylglycerol lipase (DAGL) for the synthesis and monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL) for the degradation, in the PBMCs of 21 subjects with episodic migraine (EM), 19 subjects with chronic migraine and MO (CM-MO) and an age- and sex-matched control group (CT, N=21).

The patients were 13 to 67 years of age (average 36.2 years), including 7 males and 4 females. Headache was bilateral in 4 cases, unilateral side variable in 4 cases, and strictly unilateral in 2 cases. One case had no headache. The maximum headache intensity was NRS 9.7/10 on average. The longest headache duration was 39.6 h on average, with a maximum of 5 days. The four cases had allodynia. Aura symptoms preceded headache in two cases, aura and headache at the same time in two cases, and headache before aura in six cases. The motor symptoms were unilateral in nine cases and bilateral in two cases. Out of six cases of unilateral headache, ipsilateral headache was noted in four cases and contralateral headache in two cases. The progress of paralysis was the upper limbs followed by the lower limbs in four cases, at the same time in two cases, and the lower limbs followed by the upper limbs in two cases. The duration of paralysis was from 5 minutes to 2 months, with a median of 150 minutes, and in 2 cases, the paralysis was persistent. Sensory symptoms appeared in all cases. Speech symptoms were confirmed in eight cases and visual symptoms in seven cases. Brainstem symptoms were observed in eight cases, two of which showed a decreased level of consciousness. The order of occurrence of each aura was two cases along the order of visual sense, sensation, language, exercise, brain stem, but most of them were not constant. Genetic testing was performed in 10 cases, and SCN 1 A and ATP 1 A 2 were detected in 1 SHM case each. </p> <p id="Par204"> <b>Discussion:</b> Many SHM cases are encountered at the tertiary headache center, some of which have persistent motor symptoms. The order of aura symptoms is diverse, with headache often preceding, and paralysis may be bilateral and ipsilateral.

The aim of the present study is to investigate functional connectivity within the salience network (SN) and the default mode network (DMN) in episodic migraine (EM) and chronic migraine (CM), in order to identify any functional brain connectivity changes associated with chronicization. </p> <p id="Par206">Methods: Patients consecutively referring to the Regional Headache Centre of LâAquila with a diagnosis of migraine were screened for the inclusion in the study. The diagnosis of EM or CM was made according to the criteria of the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD-III beta version). Twenty-four women with EM (mean age 45.5Â±8.7) and 24 women with CM (mean age 45.8Â±9.0) were included. Patients underwent a neuroradiological assessment through a 3 Tesla Magnetic resonance Imaging (MRI) scanner (Discovery MR750w). Resting-State fMRI data were analysed by means of a seed-based approach, using four and six different seeds, sampling the main hubs of the DMN and SN respectively. </p> <p id="Par207">Results: Alterations in functional connectivity were found in patients with CM as compared to patients with EM in the SN. Specifically, alterations involved the salience network between the left anterior insular cortex and the midcingulate cortex (p=0.0001) and the right supramarginal gyrus (p=0.0005). Further alterations were found in the connectivity between the right supramarginal gyrus and the left frontal operculum (p=0.0005). </p> <p id="Par208">Discussion: Our findings suggest that the SN, which is involved in the integration of sensory, emotional and cognitive information, may be dysregulated in patients with CM, especially in its crucial hubs represented by the anterior insula and the cingulate cortex. Dysfunctional connection among cortical hubs deserves further investigation in order to better understand migraine pathogenesis and to develop effective treatment strategies. </p> <p id="Par209"> <b>References</b> </p> <p id="Par210">1.

The goal of this study was to describe how consulting a specially trained headache nurse affects the quality of life (QoL) of headache patients. </p> <p id="Par231"> <b>Methods.</b> Data was prospectively collected over the course of 2 years. The trial included patients of both genders (ages 18â65 years) with a diagnosis of a primary headache and no other significant comorbidity which could affect the QoL of the individual whom a neurologist had referred to a headache nurse consultation. Participants were randomly assigned to three groups. The first group received three consultations during the six month period: at the start of the trial and after three and six months. The second group was evaluated three times but the consultations took place twice: three and six months after the initial appointment. The control group was evaluated twice â first during the initial appointment and the second six months later; they received one consultation session at the end of the trial. Two tests were used for evaluation: Headache Impact Test (HIT-6) and Headache Under-Response to Treatment (HURT) survey. </p> <p id="Par232">The study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the University of Tartu.</p> <p id="Par233"> <b>Results.</b> The trial included 80 patients; 64 of them attended all study appointments. The results of the study indicated that the QoL of patients who consulted a nurse improved remarkably compared to the control group. HIT-6 and HURT scores indicated substantial changes (p&amp;lt;0.01) in the mean scores of the first and second group. In the first group, the mean score of HIT-6 decreased from 63.3 to 56 at the time of the last appointment and the mean HURT score fell from 13.5 to 6.9. The second group scores dropped from 63 to 57 and from 13.5 to 7.1 respectively. The control group's mean scores of HIT-6 and HURT changed insignificantly. </p> <p id="Par234"> <b>Discussion.</b> Consulting a headache nurse improves patients' QoL. The effect becomes apparent over a longer period of time. The results do not allow to conclude that a first consultation immediately after a doctor's appointment would be better for the QoL outcomes compared to a first consultation that took place three months after the initial appointment. </p> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="a34botulinumtoxintype-atreatmentinchronicclusterheadache:acaseseriesof19patients" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

Effectiveness of botulinum toxin type-A(BTX-A) has been reported in chronic migraine by probably inhibiting the release of CGRP in trigeminal terminals. Similarities between both pathologies are the rationale basis to investigate the use of BTX-A for CCH therapy. </p> <p id="Par236">Methods: Descriptive retrospective single-center study with a prospectively collected database, including CCH patients treated with BTX-A according to the PREEMPT study protocol or modified unilateral PREEMPT protocol,repeated every three to four months. Simultaneous preventive medication was initially continued,being three patients carriers of occipital neurostimulators. Primary endpoints are effectiveness(measured as at least a 50% reduction in attack frequency or pain intensity compared to baseline) and reduction in disability(measured by HIT6 and HADS scores).Data obtained from diaries and medical registries. </p> <p id="Par237">Results: 19 patients were included,15 males,age range 29-76 years(mean 46.94(+/-11.63SD) and disease duration of 10.28 years(+/-9.42SD).

However, to date no studies have been conducted to evaluate the role of PEA in the management of migraine in pediatric patients. </p> <p id="Par247"> <i>OBJECTIVE:</i> <b> <i>The aim of this open-label study was to evaluate the efficacy of ultramicronized PEA (um-PEA) in the prophylactic treatment of migraine. </i> </b> </p> <p id="Par248"> <b>Methods:</b> The study included 53 patients with mean age of 10.67 Â± 3.1 (24.5% M and 75.5% F). All patients had a diagnosis of migraine without aura (ICHD 3 criteria) and received umPEA (600 mg/day orally) for three months. We compared the attack frequency (AF) and attack intensity at baseline and after three months. Patients were asked to classify the intensity of the attack with a value ranging from 1 to 3 where 1 means mild attack, 2 moderate and 3 severe attack. </p> <p id="Par249"> <b>Results:</b> After 3 months of treatment with um-PEA, the headache frequency was reduced by &amp;gt;50 % per month in 56.6% patients. Three patients discontinued treatment too early (less than a month) and were not considered in the results. After three months of treatment the number of monthly attacks decreased significantly compared to the start of therapy (from 13.89 Â± 7.6 SD to 6.43 Â± 5.1 SD; p&amp;lt;0.05) The intensity of the attacks went from 1.70 Â± 0.6 (pre-PEA) to 1.19 Â± 0.5 (post-PEA). </p> <p id="Par250"> <b>Discussion:</b> Our preliminary data show that um-PEA administered for three month reduces pain intensity and the number of attacks per month in in pediatric patients with migraine. Although the small number of patients and the lack of control group do not allow us to consider these initial results as definitely reliable, they encourage us to expand the sample. </p> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="a37acaseofsupraorbitalneuralgiasuccessfullytreatedwithpregabalin" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

The symptoms usually emerged during exposure to cold wind while recently appeared even with light touch being quite disabling for the patient. There was no past history of trauma but he used to wear a tight-fitting motorcycle helmet. On palpation, there was a tender area over the exit of the right supraorbital nerve. Neurological assessment and brain imaging was normal. The patient was advised to change his helmet and to receive pregabalin to a total dose of 150mg. The patient improved significantly and after a 6-month-period, he gradually discontinued the medication without recurrence. </p> <p id="Par253">Discussion: Our patient fulfilled the criteria A and B set by ICHD-II for supraorbital neuralgia. He also exhibited allodynia and exteroceptive precipitating mechanisms usually seen in cases related to head trauma, although he did not reported any. Due to the rarity of the condition and its similarity of presentation as other headaches, it is important to correctly diagnose and treat the patient.

Cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) and benign paroxysmal torticollis (BPT) are well characterized and represent a frequent cause of request for specialistic consultations. Aim of this study is to longitudinally assess the rate of headache in patients presenting with CVS and BPT during infancy, and to define the main clinical features of the disorder. <b>Methods</b>. We administered a questionnaire to the parents of all our pediatric patients with previous diagnosis of CVS and/or BPT according to ICHD-3; questions were focused on the main clinical features of the disorder as well as the prognosis, with particular emphasis on the development of headache. <b>Results</b>. For the final analysis we considered 82 patients with CVS and 33 with BPT. Seventy-nine percent of patients with CVS presented with headache during the follow-up, with a mean age at onset of 6 years; 67% of patients with BPT suffered from headache during the follow-up, with a mean age at onset of 5 years. <b>Discussion</b>. CVS and BPT are associated with a very high risk of developing headache, mostly migraine, later in life. In both groups of patients, the vast majority presented with different periodic migraine variants at different ages, thus suggesting an age dependent evolution of migraine-like symptoms before the onset of clear migrainous headache. </p> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="a39dysphasiaandotherhighercorticaldysfunctionsduringthemigraineaura-asystematicreviewofliterature" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

Yet, patients can experience also other disturbances during their MA that can be defined higher cortical dysfunctions (HCDs). HCDs can belong to visual group (i.e. prosopagnosia), somatosensory group (i.e. astereognosis, dyspraxia, and neglect of own body parts), language group (i.e. Broca's dysphasia, Wernicke's dysphasia, and dysnomia) and memory group (e. g. difficulties to remember or recall events, recall names, and calculating and/or memorizing numbers). </p> <p id="Par260"> <b>Methods:</b> We performed a systematic literature search in order to identify all the studies evaluating symptoms of HCDs during MA. </p> <p id="Par261"> <b>Results:</b> We identified five studies including 697 patients. Overall, symptoms of HCDs occurred at a frequency of 10 to 65% of subjects, and the most frequently reported was dysphasia (range 10-53%). Visual HCDs occurred in 13-40% of the patients. Somatosensory HCDs were reported in 12-20% (manual dyspraxia being the most frequently reported), while memory disturbances were noted in 10-15% of the patients. </p> <p id="Par262"> <b>Discussion:</b> MA can be associated with a wide range of neurological symptoms, among which symptoms of HCDs seem to be quite frequent according to our literature review. Despite this, HCDs in MA have been poorly investigated so far and, with the exception of dysphasia, are not included in ICHD-III among other MA disturbances. We believe such symptoms should be further investigated contributing to a better understanding of MA pathophysiology and to a proper stratification of patients in the research setting. </p> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="a40poorsleepqualityintension-typeheadache:apopulation-basedstudy" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

Although such headaches are usually mild in severity, some individuals with TTH experience severe symptoms and psychiatric comorbidities. Such patients may also experience sleep disturbances, which have been associated with headache exacerbation. However, information on the prevalence and clinical implication of poor sleep quality among individuals with TTH is scarce. Thus, the aim of this study was to assess the prevalence and clinical impact of poor sleep quality in individuals with TTH in a population-based setting. </p> <p id="Par279"> <b>Methods:</b> We used data from the Korean Headache-Sleep Study, a nation-wide survey regarding headache and sleep for adults aged 19-69 years. Depression was defined as Patient Health Questionnaire-9 score â¥ 10. </p> <p id="Par280"> <b>Results:</b> Of 2,695 participants who completed the survey, 570 (21.2%) had TTH and 715 (26.5%) had poor sleep quality. Among individuals with TTH, the prevalence of poor sleep quality among individuals with TTH participants with â¥15 headache frequency per month (50.0%) was significantly higher than TTH participants with 1-14 headache frequency (36.7%, p&amp;lt;0.001), TTH participants with &amp;lt;1 headache frequency per month (24.2%, p&amp;lt;0.001). For subjects with TTH, headache frequency per month (3.0Â±6.1 vs. 1.5Â±4.1, p=0.006), visual analogue scale score for headache intensity (5.0[3.0-6.0] vs. 4.0[3.0-5.0], median and interquartile range, p=0.003) and the Headache Impact Test-6 (45.8Â±6.9 vs. 43.0Â±6.1, p&amp;lt;0.001) were higher in participants with poor sleep quality than in those without poor sleep quality. </p> <p id="Par281"> <b>Conclusions:</b> Our findings suggest that poor sleep is linked to an exacerbation of TTH. Therefore, the proper evaluation and management of sleep may lead to the better management of TTH. The prevalence of poor sleep quality between individuals with TTH and those with non-headache did not significantly differ (34.5% vs. 28.7%, p=0.224). </p> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="a41headacheandbrainvascularmalformations:pitfallsinthediagnostic" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

However, the specific characteristics of BVM-assotiated headache are still poorly described. TMethods: Between 2005 and 2018 years 397 consecutive patients with BVM were managed. We conducted a comprehensive clinical, neuropsychological and neuroimaging examination of this subjects. Headache was characterized according to ICHD-II criteria. </p> <p id="Par283">Results: In our study, 68% of women and 54% of men were found to have headache (42% had migraine-like headache without aura, 29% - migraine-like headache with aura, 25% - tension-type headache, 14% - trigeminal-like autonomic cephalgias). In 206 patients (52%) it was the first symptom of the disease. Clinical and radiological findings of BVM images showed that headache occurred significantly more frequently among larger malformations (with vs. without headache, 12.7 vs. 5.1 ml, p=0,002), with transdural arterial communication (84.6 vs. 29.7%, p = 0.001), occipital and midbrain BVM (69.5 vs. 29.1%, p &amp;lt; 0.001), older patients (43.1 vs. 36.6 years, p = 0.037). It should be marked that only 32% of headache patients with BVM completely meet ICH-III criteria for primary headaches, 68% patients - have specific headache features or additional symptoms, allowed to suspect their secondary character. </p> <p id="Par284">Discussion: Intractable, primary-like headaches, which dont completely meet ICH-III criteria, should increase suspicion for BVM and prompt neuroimaging. The pathogenesis of headache in BVM patients may involve several mechanisms and demonstrate general lesion of the brain vessels caused by disgenesis. Unfortunatelly, causality is far from clear and need future investigations. </p> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="a42consistentreductionsinmigrainefrequencywitheptinezumabtreatmentinpatientswithmigrainestratifiedbydiseasecharacteristics:subgroupanalysisofpromise-1andpromise-2" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

As it was not specifically developed using feedback from/tailored to patients with migraine, its use in this population has been criticized. The objective of this systematic literature review was to identify qualitative evidence of the content validity of the HIT-6 with respect to patients with migraine. </p> <p id="Par291"> <b>Methods:</b> English-language reports of HIT-6 use were identified through systematic searches of PubMed and Google Scholar using <i>a priori</i> specified search terms. Independent reviewers identified eligible studies (those with qualitative research or psychometric results regarding HIT-6 content) and summarized evidence of content validity. </p> <p id="Par292"> <b>Results:</b> Twelve publications were identified with supportive qualitative evidence for HIT-6 content validity, 8 specific to migraine (episodic and chronic) and 4 citing general headache patients.

The objective of this analysis was to identify responder definitions for the individual HIT-6 items in patients with chronic migraine (CM). </p> <p id="Par298"> <b>Methods:</b> Responder definitions for the HIT-6 items were analyzed using the PROMISE-2 (NCT02974153) study population of patients with CM (N=1024 available at Week 12). HIT-6 responses were scored using integers (from 1=never to 5=always). Multiple anchor-based methods were used to establish a responder threshold: patient global impression of change, â¥75% reduction in migraine frequency, and EuroQOL 5-dimensions 5-level (EQ-5D-5L) visual analog scale. Resulting candidate responder values were plotted against the cumulative distribution function of change values (baseline to week 12) and used to triangulate to empirically supported responder definitions for the HIT-6 items in patients with CM. </p> <p id="Par299"> <b>Results:</b> Responder definition thresholds for individual HIT-6 items were found to be an improvement of 1 category on items 1 (pain severity), 2 (limits daily activities), and 3 (wish to lie down) and improvement of 2 categories on items 4 (too tired to work), 5 (felt fed up or irritated), and 6 (limits concentration). For all 3 anchor-based analyses across each of the 6 items, the improved group exhibited greater mean improvement in HIT-6 item scores than the reference (no change/worse) group. </p> <p id="Par300"> <b>Discussion:</b> For patients with CM, improvements of 1 category on items 1â3 or 2 categories on items 4â6 of the HIT-6 appear most appropriate for identifying CM patients who have experienced meaningful change at the item level. These results can be used to facilitate the interpretation of HIT-6 findings in clinical trials and by clinicians. </p> <p id="Par301"> <b>Funding/Sponsor</b> </p> <p id="Par302">Financial Support: Funding and support provided by Alder BioPharmaceuticals, Inc., Bothell, WA, USA. </p> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="a45consistentreductionsinmigrainefrequencywitheptinezumabtreatmentinpatientswithmigrainestratifiedbyintrinsicfactors:subgroupanalysesofpromise-1andpromise-2" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

Medication Overuse Headache (MOH) is a headache occurring on â¥15 days/month in patients with pre-existing primary headache and developing as a consequence of regular overuse of symptomatic medication. Aim of this study was to analyze the clinical features of pediatric MOH, with particular emphasis on the applicability of ICHD-3 criteria. <b>Methods</b>. We retrospectively analyzed clinical data of pediatric patients with MOH; the clinical diagnosis was verified according to ICHD-3 criteria. Although no more included in the diagnostic criteria, we analyzed how many patients presented a clinical benefit after discontinuation of overused medication. <b>Results</b>. We identified 42 subjects diagnosed with MOH (31 F, 11 M), aged 8-17 years (mean 13.4 years). They all presented with chronic migraine, 9% fulfilled a diagnosis of migraine with aura. Photo- and photophobia were present in 81% of patients, nausea/vomiting in 30%, dizziness in 18%. ICHD-3 criterion A was fulfilled by 40/42 patients (95%), criterion B by 35/42 (83%), and criterion C by 40/42 (95%). Nineteen patients (45%) did not present an improvement of headache after medication overuse cessation. <b>Discussion</b>. The old criteria required a development or marked worsening of the headache during medication overuse, and a resolution within 2 months after medication withdrawal. Both these criteria disappeared in ICHD-3. Our data show that, without the necessity of demonstrating a clear and direct correlation with abuse and discontinuation of symptomatic medications, a definite diagnosis can be achieved in a high rate of patients with a clinical suspicion of MOH. Nearly half of patients with MOH didnât improve after medication overuse cessation, thus raising the doubt of a true causal relationship between medication overuse and chronic headache. <b>Conclusion</b>. A high rate of patients with a definite diagnosis of MOH according to new criteria continued to present a high frequency headache despite the withdrawal of overuse. </p> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="a47roleofmaternalstressandalexithymiainchildrenâsmigraineseverityandpsychologicalprofile" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

Recent studies showed that patientsâ attachment style and maternal alexithymia traits may impact on psychological profile and pain expression in children/adolescents suffering from migraine. So far, very few studies explored the relationship between maternal stress, childrenâs psychological profile and migraine severity. Aims of our study were to explore the role of maternal parenting stress and alexithymia on: 1) childrenâs headache severity (frequency); 2) maternal perception of childrenâs psychological conditions and 3) childrenâs psychological profile. </p> <p id="Par310"> <b>Methods</b>. We studied 51 migraineurs (mean age 11.6 Â± 2.1 years; 22 M and 29 F). Patients were divided in two groups according to the headache attacks frequency (high and low). Maternal stress and alexithymia levels were evaluated by PSI-SF and TAS-20 questionnaires. We used SAFA "Anxiety" and "Depression" scales to explore children's psychological profile. To evaluate maternal perception of childrenâs psychological conditions CBCL 6/18 was employed. <b>Results</b>. We found a correlation between maternal stress and CBCL Internalizing (p= 0.00), Externalizing (p= 0.00) and Total scales (p= 0.00). A positive correlation has been identified between mothersâ PSI Total score and SAFA-D Total score (p= 0.03). In particular, a positive correlation was found between "Parental distress" and childrenâs SAFA-D "Feeling of guilt" subscales (p= 0.04). Maternal stress and alexithymia did not show significant differences among the two migraine frequency groups (p &amp;gt;0.05). However, in high frequency group, PSI Total score showed a positive correlation with Internalizing scale (p= 0.00). No relationships were found between TAS-20, CBCL, SAFA and migraine frequency. <b>Conclusions</b>. Maternal stress has no relationship with childrenâs migraine frequency. However, it shows a relationship with maternal perception of childrenâs psychological profile and patientsâ depressive symptoms, which in turn may impact on migraine severity. </p> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="a48isitusefultodeterminecgrp,vip,andpacapinmigraine?across-sectionalstudyinchronicmigrainepatients" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

As fruits and vegetables are considered as major sources of vitamins, minerals and dietary antioxidant, numerous studies have suggested them effective in various types of chronic disease. Limited evidence exists on the effect of diet on pediatric migraine, so we aimed to investigate the association between fruit and vegetable consumption and odds of migraine in children </p> <p id="Par317"> <b>Method:</b> We conducted a case-control study in tertiary hospital, Tehran, Iran. One hundred children with migraine as case group and 190 sex-matched healthy controls were recruited in this study. Definite diagnosis of migraine was based on 2018 international classification of headache disorder 3 (ICHD3) criteria and confirmed by a neurologist. Demographic and anthropometric characteristics were collected. Common dietary intake of participants was obtained using a validated semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). In order to run logistic regression models, all variables were classified into tertiles except for dietary fiber which was stratified into quartiles. </p> <p id="Par318"> <b>Result:</b> Children in the migraine group had significantly higher BMI and age compared with the control group (P-value=0.00). After adjustment for age, gender, BMI and total energy intake a significant association between higher intake of vegetables in second tertile (OR: 0.47;CI:0.24-0.92), fruits in third tertile (OR: 0.31;CI:0.14-0.69) and fiber in fourth quartile (OR: 0.28;CI:0.095-0.85) was obtained. By controlling for all confounders in model 3, the odds of migraine, decreased by 50% and 70% by increasing in vegetables and fruits consumption, in the second tertile of vegetables (P-value=0.04) and the third tertile of fruits (P-value=0.00). We noticed 50% and 70% reduction in odds of assigning to migraine group by increasing the consumption of vegetable and fruit to 218/5 gr/week and 578/85 gr/week in the second tertile of vegetable and third teritle of fruit compared with the first tertile, respectively. Also a 72% reduction in odds of migraine was observed by an incremented level of fiber intake to 46/43 gr /week in the fourth quartile of dietary fiber. </p> <p id="Par319"> <b>Conclusion:</b> Our findings confirm a plausible protective role of dietary fruits and vegetables against the risk of migraine in children which can be attributed to the probable effect of vitamins, minerals and also dietary fiber. </p> <p id="Par320"> <b>Keywords:</b> Migraine, Pediatrics, fruits, vegetables, odds </p> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="a50excessivedaytimesleepinessintension-typeheadache:apopulation-basedstudy" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

Tension-type headache (TTH) is the most common headache disorder in general population. Owing to its higher prevalence, the social burden of TTH is greater than that caused by migraine. Previous study has demonstrated that EDS was prevalent among migraineurs and was associated with an exacerbation of migraine. Nevertheless, information on the association between EDS and TTH is limited. The aim of this study is to investigate the association and impact of EDS on participants with TTH in a population-based setting. </p> <p id="Par323"> <b>Methods</b> </p> <p id="Par324">This study used the data of the Korean Headache-Sleep Study (KHSS), which was a population-based survey regarding headache and sleep for Korean adults aged 19â69 years. If the score on the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) was more than or equal to 11, the participant was classified as having EDS. </p> <p id="Par325"> <b>Results</b> </p> <p id="Par326">Of the 2695 participants, 570 (21.2%) and 313 (11.6%) were classified as having TTH and EDS, respectively. EDS was more prevalent among TTH participants with â¥15 headache frequency per month compared with participants with non-headache (35.7% vs. 9.4%, p &amp;lt; 0.001). Prevalence of EDS among TTH participants with headache frequency &amp;lt;1 per month (8.3%, p = 0.511) and TTH participants with headache frequency 1â14 per month (13.5%, p = 0.054) was not significantly different from that of those with non-headache. TTH participants with EDS had higher headache frequency per month (4.3 Â± 8.1 vs. 1.7 Â± 4.2, p = 0.013), Visual Analogue Scale for headache intensity (5.0 [3.0 â 6.0] vs. 4.0 [3.0 â 6.0], p = 0.008), Headache Impact Test-6 score (47.1 Â± 7.3 vs. 43.5 Â± 7.6, p &amp;lt; 0.001) and more depression (Patient Health questionnaire scoreâ¥10) (12.7% vs. 3.2%, p &amp;lt; 0.001) compared to those without EDS. Multivariable logistic regression revealed that headache frequency (Î²=0.051, p=0.016), Headache Impact Test-6 score (Î²=0.051, p=0.016), and depression (Î²=1.230, p=0.011) were independently associated with the existence of EDS among TTH participants. </p> <p id="Par327"> <b>Conclusions</b>EDS is more prevalent in TTH participants with &amp;gt;15 headache frequency per month compared to those with non-headache. TTH participants with EDS was independently associated with higher headache frequency, increased impact of headache and higher prevalence of depression compared to those without EDS. </p> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="a51hemiplegicmigrainewithlate-onsetcerebellarsignsasphenotypicvariantofcanca1amutation.casereport" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

In some cases, genes that prove causality have been identified (CACNA1A, ATP1A2, SCN1A). Although patients with mutations in CACNA1A may present with cerebellar ataxia, the presence of both clinical entities and moreover the emergence of late-onset cerebellar symptoms in a patient with known FHM, is extremely rare. </p> <p id="Par330"> <b>Case report</b> </p> <p id="Par331">We present a case of 32-year-old man with a long-standing diagnosis of sporadic HM treated successfully with valproic acid who reports a mild difficulty in walking and a slight change in his speech, starting from 2 years ago. Neurological examination revealed cerebellar signs of mild dysarthria/scanning speech, mild gait ataxia (difficulty in tandem walking test), and dysdiadochokinesia while neuroimaging studies revealed cerebellar atrophy. The rest laboratory testing was without any pathological finding. </p> <p id="Par332"> <b>Results</b> </p> <p id="Par333">The following genetic tests for mutations in spinocerebellar ataxia related genes (SCA panel) were all negative. Finally, a genetic study of FHM was performed and a heterozygous point mutation in CACNA1 gene (c.4046G&amp;gt;A, pArg1349Gln) was revealed, supporting the above findings. </p> <p id="Par334"> <b>Discussion</b> </p> <p id="Par335">Whereas changes in ion channels may provide an explanation for aura symptoms (cortical hyperexcitability) and cerebellar degeneration (Purkinje cell expression), the pathophysiology and clinical presentation of CANCA1A mutations remain unknown. It is proposed that in any newly diagnosed case of HM, especially when cerebellar signs are present, appropriate genetic testing should be performed even in the absence of positive family history. </p> <p id="Par336">Written, informed consent for publication was obtained from the patient.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="a52multi-sensorygainabnormalitiesinposturaltachycardiasyndromeexceedthoseofmigraine" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

Brennan( <u>k.c.brennan@hsc.utah.edu</u>) </div> <p id="Par337"> <b>Background:</b> Up to 90% of postural tachycardia syndrome (PoTS) patients report frequent, problematic headaches. According to current diagnostic criteria for PoTS, associated headaches might be expected to be strictly orthostatic, though comorbid migraine headache is common. Given this observation, it is possible that the two disorders interact pathophysiologically. </p> <p id="Par338"> <b>Methods:</b> 30 PoTS, 30 chronic migraine (CM), and 30 non-headache (NH) control subjects completed a migraine questionnaire, MIDAS/HIT6, and sensory/autonomic symptom assessment. Sensory testing included mechanical pain thresholds by von Frey Hair and quantitative light sensitivity thresholds. </p> <p id="Par339"> <b>Results:</b> Photophobia and allodynia symptom scores were significantly higher in both CM and PoTS groups compared to controls. COMPASS-31 autonomic symptom scores were significantly higher in PoTS compared to CM, but both groups had significantly higher scores than NH. Unexpectedly, photophobia thresholds were significantly lower in PoTS compared to CM; both PoTS and CM thresholds were significantly decreased compared to NH. Mechanical pain thresholds were also significantly lower in both CM and PoTS compared to NH. Here the patterns of expression differed between CM and PoTS, with reduced periorbital and forearm pain thresholds in CM, and only forearm threshold reductions in PoTS subjects. </p> <p id="Par340"> <b>Discussion:</b> We found evidence of âmigraine-likeâ sensitization and autonomic symptoms in both CM and PoTS subjects, suggesting common pathway activation in these often-comorbid conditions. However, we also observed distinguishable features in each disorder that likely reflect divergent network responses. We found that PoTS subjects (including PoTS subjects without migraine) had significantly lower light sensitivity thresholds, and a differing pattern of allodynia, compared to CM. This reveals an under-appreciated aspect of disease burden in PoTS, and suggests network sensitization similar to, but separable from that of migraine. </p> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="a53healthcareresourceutilizationinadultpatientstreatedwithonabotulinumtoxinaforchronicmigraine:resultsfromthecompelstudy" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

HRU data (total HA-related visits to a healthcare professional [HCP], emergency room [ER]/urgent care [UC] visits, overnight hospital stays, and number of HA-related diagnostic tests) were collected at BL (for past 6 months) and each treatment session (since last visit). </p> <p id="Par343"> <b>Results:</b> Mean age of patients (N=716) was 43 years; 85% were female.

Previous research has shown that acute sTMS treatment increases the threshold of cortical spreading depression (CSD) induction, but it does not influence trigeminal nociception. Its long-term effects have not been previously investigated. </p> <p id="Par348"> <b>Methods:</b> Daily treatments of either 1.1 T or 0 T sTMS were applied to awake male adult Sprague- Dawley rats for a period of 30 days using a custom made sTMS coil with a diameter of 11 mm and stimulating parameters similar to the migraine treatment. Behavioural testing of paraorbital von Frey thresholds was performed every other day for the first two weeks followed by every 5th day until day 30. At the conclusion of daily-treatments, CSD induction thresholds by electrical stimulation of the occipital cortex were determined in anaesthetised animals. All procedures were performed under a UK Home Office Licence in accordance to the 1986 Animal (Scientific Procedures) Act. </p> <p id="Par349"> <b>Results:</b> Thirty days of daily treatment with 1.1 T sTMS induced no significant changes in the paraorbital von Frey threshold compared to the control group (0 T sTMS) (F1, 78 = 1.337, p&amp;lt;.251). CSD induction thresholds were found to be significantly increased in the 1.1 T sTMS treatment group compared to the 0 T controls (F1, 14 = 7.53, p&amp;lt;.016). </p> <p id="Par350"> <b>Discussion:</b> Daily sTMS treatment did not alter mechanical von Frey thresholds suggesting it does not sensitize the trigeminal system. The increase in the CSD threshold in the active treatment group does suggest that sTMS has a long-term cumulative effect in inhibiting cortical excitation. </p> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="a55depressionandanxietylikesymptomsinprimaryheadachedisorders" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
