 <result pre="out and that can be to different extents impaired by" exact="migraine" post="headaches: patients may in fact be limited in their"/>
 <result pre="interictal ones (although the presence of an interictal burden in" exact="migraine" post="has been shown [ 9, 10]). The debate on"/>
 <result pre="on which domains or daily life are mostly affected by" exact="migraine" post="headaches is therefore not easy to address and needs"/>

 <result pre="limited to few domains. Parallel to this, studies strictly addressing" exact="migraine" post="burden rely on YLDs and DALYs, and eventually on"/>
