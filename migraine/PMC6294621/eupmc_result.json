    "PURPOSE:The association between GRIA1 rs548294 G>A and rs2195450 C>T polymorphisms and migraine risk has been reported in several case-control studies. However, the results of studies are inconsistent. Thus, we conducted a meta-analysis to more precisely estimate the association of the two polymorphisms with migraine risk. METHODS:Eligible studies were retrieved and screened from the online databases (EMBASE, PubMed, Web of Science, Wanfang, and Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure). The pooled odds ratio (OR) with corresponding 95.0% confidence intervals (CIs) was assessed using random- or fixed-effects model. RESULTS:A total of 1233 cases and 1374 controls from four eligible studies were included. The pooled analysis showed that GRIA1 rs548294 G>A polymorphism was not significantly associated with migraine risk. GRIA1 rs2195450 C>T polymorphism was significantly associated with migraine risk under heterozygous model (CT vs. CC, OR = 1.23, 95%CI = 1.02-1.48, P Z = 0.03). Further subgroup analysis based on ethnicity showed a significant association of GRIA1 rs2195450 C>T polymorphism with migraine risk in Asian population, but not in Caucasian population. CONCLUSIONS:Our results indicates that GRIA1 rs2195450 C>T polymorphism is significantly associated with migraine risk. However, the number of studies included in the meta-analysis was small. Thus, more high quality case-control studies with a large sample size are still required to confirm these findings."
