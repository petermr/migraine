  <result pre="the increased life-time prevalence of syncope and orthostatic intolerance in" exact="migraine" post="patients [ 130]. Another study based on analysis of"/>

  <result pre="results, there has been discussion that the primary driver for" exact="migraine" post="attacks is in the hypothalamic-brainstem connectivity [ 152], as"/>
  <result pre="daily fMRI scan with trigeminal activation in patients with spontaneous" exact="migraine" post="attacks was done over a period of 1 month"/>
  <result pre="1 month [ 152]. The involvement of the hypothalamus in" exact="migraine" post="is also supported by the resting state activity and"/>
  <result pre="connectivity of the hypothalamus which was achieved in 12 interictal" exact="migraine" post="patients [ 153]. Interestingly, the hypothalamus showed multiple connections"/>
  <result pre="154]. These connections could explain episodic syndromes such as abdominal" exact="migraine" post="and cyclic vomiting by alteration of the central pathways"/>
  <result pre="in the cerebellum of rats and which was related to" exact="episodic ataxia" post="type 1 (EA1), a syndrome caused by a mutation"/>
