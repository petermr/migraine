        <span class="abst" title="Pediatric migraine is a disabling condition, which can cause a significant impact on quality of life. Currently, no drugs have been approved by the FDA for its preventive treatment. Our aim was to review the medical literature concerning the efficacy and tolerability of topiramate in the prophylactic treatment of migraine in children and adolescents. A total of five papers were reviewed: two randomized controlled trials (RCTs), a post-hoc subset analysis of adolescents who had been included in three RCTs carried out on adults and two open studies. Topiramate has been proven to reduce headache frequency and the accompanying disability. The frequency of side effects varied considerably among studies, the most frequent being weight loss, anorexia, abdominal pain, difficulties in concentrating, sedation and paresthesia. Since these adverse events, although often transitory, may be distressing for the child, we strongly recommend to assess the disability caused by the migraine episodes before deciding to initiate a prophylactic treatment. Nevertheless, dropout rates due to side effects in the studies were very low.">

The pathophysiological concepts have evolved from a purely vascular etiology to a neuroinflammatory process. Clinical evaluation is the mainstay of diagnosis and should also include family history. Investigations help to rule out secondary causes. The role of new drugs in treatment of migraine is discussed and trials are quoted from literature. Indications for starting prophylaxis should be evaluated based on frequency of attacks and influence on quality of life. For management of acute attacks of migraine both acetaminophen and ibuprofen are recommended for use in children. Many drugs like antiepileptic drugs (AED), calcium channel blockers, and antidepressants have been used for prophylaxis of migraine in children. The data for use of newer drugs for migraine in children is limited, though AEDs are emerging a popular choice. Biofeedback and other nonmedicinal therapies are being used with promising results.">

Known and common migraine triggers and family history of migraine were recorded in all. All the children studied had moderate to severe headache lasting 5 to 45 minutes which forced them motionless during the attacks (thus fulfilling 2 diagnostic pain features). At least one of the ICHD2 pediatric migraine diagnostic symptoms (nausea / vomiting / photophobia / phonophobia) were present in all. Two additional features were diagnostic of brief migraines in all of them- one of the parents or siblings was a migrainer and one of the common migraine triggers as a precipitating factor. This study concludes that if duration of head pain is less than one hour ,two additional features to be included to diagnose definitive migraine in children and adolescents - one migraine parent or sibling and one of the migraine triggers precipitating the head pain.">

        <span class="abst" title="OBJECTIVE: Migraine is a common neurological disorder in childhood and adolescence. Topiramate is a new anticonvulsant drug, recently being used in migraine prophylaxis in adults, although it is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration for prevention of pediatric migraine. The present study was planned and performed to evaluate the efficacy of low-dose topiramate in pediatric migraine prophylaxis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective study, including 60 patients with migraine headaches was performed for a period of two months. The patients were randomly divided into two treatment groups - treated by topiramate &lt; 2 mg/kg/day and &gt; 2 mg/kg/day. All the patients were evaluated at 0, 4, and 8 weeks of the study for the clinical response. RESULTS: The patients receiving topiramate &lt; 2 mg/kg/day (mean dose of 1.2 ± 0.7 mg/kg/day) showed a reduction in the mean (±SD) of migraine frequency from 6.2 (±2.4) to 3.0 (±1.8) episodes per month, headache intensity from 7.2 (±1.95) to 3.7 (±1.8) based on the Visual Analog Scale, and headache duration from 5.4 (±2.1) to 2.2 (±1.3) h. In the patients treated with topiramate &gt; 2 mg/kg/day (mean dose of 2.4 ± 0.5 mg/kg/day), the mean (±SD) of monthly headache frequency reduced from 6.9 (±2.1) to 3.24 (±1.2) per month, intensity from 7.11 (±1.4) to 3.14 (±2.41), and headache duration from 5.2 (±2.4) to 1.8 (±1.2) h, at the end of follow-up (P &gt; 0.05). The most common side effects of topiramate were paresthesias (five patients), anorexia (four patients), drowsiness (four patients). CONCLUSION: The results of this study demonstrated that low-dose of topiramate (&lt;2 mg/kg/day) is effective, well-tolerated, safe, and suggested as an alternative prophylactic treatment for pediatric migraine.">

        <span class="abst" title="BACKGROUND: Despite growing interest in psychotherapy in child and adolescent headache, efficacy studies in this research field have focused mainly on cognitive-behavioral therapies. Whereas relaxation and cognitive-behavioral techniques, in particular, have been found to reduce the intensity and frequency of headache in children and adolescents, data on psychodynamic psychotherapy in this population are lacking.Our aim was to explore the effectiveness of a brief psychodynamic psychotherapy program in the treatment of idiopathic headache in childhood and adolescence. METHODS: Thirty-three newly diagnosed idiopathic headache sufferers aged 6-18 years, consecutively referred to our outpatient services, were randomized to receive either a brief cycle of psychodynamic psychotherapy (eight sessions administered at two-week intervals) or usual care (clinical interview, neurological examination, counselling, symptomatic therapy).The two groups were evaluated at baseline (T0) and at six months (T1) to be assessed for headache characteristics (i.e. frequency, intensity and duration), quality of life (i.e. the EuroQoL score), patient's global health status (i.e. the Clinical Global Impression score), and emotional-behavioral symptoms (i.e. Child Behavior Checklist scores). RESULTS: The two groups were fairly similar with reference to the main demographic and clinical variables. The T0/T1 comparison showed a statistically significant improvement in headache frequency (p = 0.005), intensity (p &lt; 0.001) and duration (p = 0.002), a statistically significant improvement in the CGI score (p = 0.018), and a borderline improvement in the EuroQoL score (p = 0.053) in the group receiving psychotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: According to our pilot findings, a brief psychodynamic psychotherapy program may be more effective than usual care in children and adolescents with idiopathic headache.">

Participants were randomly assigned to complete the Headstrong or educational control CD-ROM program over a 4-week period. Data on headache frequency, duration, and severity, migraine-related disability, and quality of life (QOL) were obtained at baseline, post-intervention, and 3-months post-intervention.At post-intervention, Headstrong resulted in lower severity (on a 10-point scale) than the control group by child report (5.06 ± 1.50 SD vs. 6.25 ± 1.92 SD, p = 0.03, ES = 0.7). At 3-months post-intervention, parents reported less migraine-related disability (on the PedMIDAS) in the Headstrong group compared to the control group (1.36 ± 2.06 SD vs. 5.18 ± 6.40 SD; p = 0.04, ES = 0.8). There were no other group differences at post treatment or at 3-months post-intervention.When compared to an educational control, Headstrong resulted in lower pain severity at post-treatment and less migraine-related disability at 3-months post-intervention, by child and parent report respectively. Headache frequency and quality of life did not change more for Headstrong versus control. Additional research is needed on the Headstrong Program to increase its efficacy and to test it with a larger sample recruited from multiple centers simultaneously.">

        <span class="abst" title="Migraine is a common disorder and a frequent cause of medical consultation in children. Many childhood episodic syndromes have been described as common precursors of migraine.To review current knowledge on migraine and childhood episodic syndromes, and to discuss future directions for research and clinical practice.For most children it is difficult to describe a headache and fully verbalize symptoms such as photophobia and phonophobia that must be inferred from behaviour. Classical migraine features are rare before the age of 6 years, but some migraine-related syndromes have been described. Benign paroxysmal torticollis of infancy, benign paroxysmal vertigo of childhood, cyclic vomiting syndrome and abdominal migraine are currently classified as childhood episodic syndromes, and therefore common precursors of migraine. A strong association between infantile colic and migraine has recently been reported. There are similarities between children with episodic syndromes and children with migraine, regarding social and demographic factors, precipitating and relieving factors, and accompanying gastrointestinal, neurologic, and vasomotor features. The real pathophysiological mechanisms of migraine are not fully understood. Current data obtained through molecular and functional studies provide a complex model in which vascular and neurologic events cooperate in the pathogenesis of migraine attacks. Genetic factors causing disturbances in neuronal ion channels, make a migraineur more sensitive to multiple trigger factors that activate the nociception cascade. The expanding knowledge on migraine genetics and pathophysiology may be applicable to childhood episodic syndromes. Migraine preventive strategies are particularly important in children, and could be beneficial in childhood episodic syndromes. Nonspecific analgesics like ibuprofen and acetaminophen are widely used in pediatrics to control pain and have been found to be effective also in the treatment of acute migraine attacks. Triptans are the specific fist-line drugs for acute migraine treatment.Migraine phenotype differs somewhat in the developing brain, and childhood episodic syndromes may arise before typical migraine headache. Diagnosing pediatric migraine may be difficult because of children's language and cognitive abilities. The risk of underestimating migraine in pediatric age is high. An adequate diagnosis is important to maintain a good quality of life and to avoid inappropriate therapy.">

This study aimed to evaluate the frequency and the clinical characteristics of allodynia, pericranial tenderness, and comorbidity for Juvenile Fibromialgia (JFM) in a cohort of migraine children selected in a tertiary headache center.This was an observational cross-sectional study on 8-15 years old migraine patients. Allodynia was assessed by a questionnaire. Pericranial tenderness and comorbidity for JFM as well as their possible association with poor quality of life and migraine related disability, and with other clinical symptoms as anxiety, depression, sleep disorders and pain catastrophizing, were also evaluated.One hundred and fifty one patients were selected, including chronic migraine (n°47), migraine without aura (n° 92) and migraine with aura (n° 12) sufferers. Allodynia was reported in the 96,6% and pericranial tenderness was observed in the 68.8% of patients. Pericranial tenderness was more severe in patients with more frequent migraine and shorter sleep duration. Allodynia seemed associated with anxiety, pain catastrophizing and high disability scores. Comorbidity for JFM was present in the 0.03% ofpatients. These children presented with a severe depression and a significant reduction of quality of life as compared to the other patients.This study outlined a relevant presence of symptoms of central sensitization among children with migraine. Severe allodynia and comorbidity for JFM seemed to cause a general decline of quality of life, which would suggest the opportunity of a routine assessment of these clinical features.">

        <span class="abst" title="BACKGROUND:Mainly based on evidence of success in adults, various medications are commonly used to prevent pediatric migraines. Topiramate has been approved for migraine prevention in children as young as 12 years of age. In this meta-analysis, we aimed to assess the currently published data pertaining to the efficacy of topiramate for migraine prevention in patients less than 18 years of age. METHODS:We searched PubMed/Medline, Embase and the Cochrane Library (from inception to April 2017) for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published in English. Two independent investigators performed data extraction and quality evaluation using the Cochrane Collaboration's tool. The data extracted were analyzed by Review Manager 5.3 software. RESULTS:A total of four RCTs matching the inclusion criteria were included, with an aggregate of 465 patients. Of these patients, 329 were included in the topiramate group, and 136 were included in the placebo group. This meta-analysis revealed that compared with placebo, topiramate failed to decrease the number of patients experiencing a ≥ 50% relative reduction in headache frequency (n = 465, RR = 1.26, 95% CI = [0.94,1.67], Z = 1.55, P = 0.12) or the number of headache days (n = 465, MD = -0.77, 95% CI = [-2.31,0.76], Z = 0.99, P = 0.32) but did reduce PedMIDAS scores (n = 205, MD = -9.02, 95% CI = [-17.34, -0.70], Z = 2.13, P = 0.03). Higher rates of side effects and adverse events in the topiramate group than in the placebo group were observed in the included trials. CONCLUSIONS:Topiramate may not achieve a more effective clinical trial endpoint than placebo in the prevention of migraines in patients less than 18 years of age, and topiramate may lead to more side effects or adverse events in the included patients.">

A positive response was defined as a reduction of more than 50% in the number of migraine episodes after topiramate treatment. Proposed predictive factors such as migraine characteristics including severity and frequency were assessed, as were other data on sex, disease duration, associated symptoms, family history, and impairment of daily activities.Seventy patients (61.9%) responded to prophylactic treatment with topiramate. Patients who experienced significant impairment in daily activities showed significant benefit from the treatment (p=0.004). Sex, the severity, frequency, and duration of migraine episodes, disease duration, treatment duration, age at onset, and associated symptoms were not significantly related to a response to topiramate treatment.Migraine characteristics and associated symptoms were not significantly related to a response to topiramate treatment. However, patients with significant impairment in daily activities showed significant benefit from the treatment, and so prophylactic topiramate treatment should be strongly encouraged in this patient group.">

The aim of the present study was to compare between males and females, demographic and clinical characteristics of children and adolescents with migraines diagnosed according to the ICDIII-beta version.The electronic database of a tertiary pediatric headache clinic was searched for all children and adolescents diagnosed with migraine headaches in 2010-2016. Data on demographics, symptoms, and headache-related parameters were collected from the medical files. Findings were compared by gender.The cohort included 468 children and adolescents of mean age 11.3 ± 3.6 years; 215 males (45.9%) and 253 females (54.1%). Migraine without aura was documented in 313 patients (66.9%), and migraine with aura in 127 (27.1%); 28 patients (6.0%) had probable migraines. The female patients had significantly higher values than the male patients for the following parameters: age at admission (p = 0.042, Cohen's d 0.8303, 95% CI 0.614-0.992); age at migraine onset (p = 0.021, Cohen's d 0.211, 95% CI 0.029-0.394); rate of migraine with aura (OR 2.01, 95% CI 1.29-3.16, p = 0.0056); headache frequency (p = 0.0149, Cohen's d 0.211, 95% CI 0.029-0.3940); rate of chronic migraine (p = 0.036, OR 1.54, 95% CI 1.02-2.34); and puberty (OR 3.51, 95% CI 2.01-6.35, p = &lt;0.001). Males had a higher rate of vomiting (OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.41-0.93, p = 0.018). Further analysis by pubertal stage revealed that pubertal females, but not prepubertal females, had a significantly higher rate of migraine with aura than did males (41.1% versus 28.9%; OR 1.42, 95% CI 0.85-2.37, p = 0.039).Female children and adolescents with migraine treated in a tertiary pediatric headache clinic were characterized by a higher rate of chronic migraine and migraine with aura, a lower rate of vomiting, and older age at onset relative to males. These findings might be influenced by the better description of migraine symptoms by females owing to their better verbal ability.">

Data were collected before treatment, and topiramate as monotherapy was sustained for at least 3 months. The mean follow-up period was 4.3±2.7 months. The mean topiramate dosage was 0.9 mg/kg/day.The patient's mean age was 144.1±42.3 months (male-to-female ratio, 9:21). The values of all the language parameters of the TOPs were not changed significantly after the topiramate treatment as follows: Determine cause, from 15.0±4.4 to 15.4±4.8 (P&gt;0.05); making inference, from 17.6±5.6 to 17.5±6.6 (P&gt;0.05); predicting, from 11.5±4.5 to 12.3±4.0 (P&gt;0.05); and total TOPs score, from 44.1± 13.4 to 45.3±13.6 (P&gt;0.05). The total mean length of utterance in words during the test decreased from 44.1±13.4 to 45.3±13.6 (P&lt;0.05). The Receptive and Expressive Vocabulary Test results decreased from 97.7±22.1 to 96.3±19.9 months, and from 81.8±23.4 to 82.3±25.4 months, respectively (P&gt;0.05). In the articulation and phonology validation in both groups, speech pitch and energy were not significant, and all the vowel test results showed no other significant values.No significant difference was found in the language-speaking ability between the patients; however, the number of vocabularies used decreased. Therefore, topiramate should be used cautiously for children with migraine.">

We aim to investigate whether migraine is associated with an increased risk of developing narcolepsy in children.In this longitudinal study, nationwide medical-claims data of pediatric patients (0-17y) with migraine are identified using the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) between 1997 and 2010 in Taiwan. Two cohorts are selected: migraine cases (n = 8,923) and propensity score-matched non-migraine controls (n = 35,692). Children with previous history of narcolepsy or headache before the index date are excluded. Cohorts are followed until the end of 2012, their withdrawal from the NHI program, or incidence of narcolepsy (ICD-9-CM: 347). Cox proportional hazards regression models are used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals of developing narcolepsy in children with migraine compared to their non-migraine controls.A total of 13 incident cases with narcolepsy are observed during follow-up, with incidence rates of 0.1915 and 0.0278 per 1,000 person-years in migraine and non-migraine children, respectively. After a mean follow-up period of 4.68 and 5.04 years in the case and control cohort, respectively, the former exhibited a greater risk of developing narcolepsy compared to the latter (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) = 5.30, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.61, 17.4; p = 0.006). This finding persisted after controlling for potential confounders like baseline comorbidities and concurrent medication uptake, and in our analyses with migraine subtypes.Migraine is an independent risk factor for narcolepsy development in children. Further studies are needed to validate our findings and to explore the exact pathophysiological mechanisms linking migraine and narcolepsy.">

Children with primary migraine were recruited from mainstream schools while children with concussion or vestibular disorder were recruited from tertiary balance centers in London, UK, and Pittsburgh, PA, USA. Children completed the PVID, which assesses the frequency of dizziness and unsteadiness experienced in specific environmental situations, and Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), a brief behavioral screening instrument.The PVID showed high internal consistency (11 items; α = 0.90). A significant between-group difference was noted with higher (i.e., worse) PVID scores for patients vs. healthy participants (U = 2,436.5, z = -10.719, p &lt; 0.001); a significant difference was noted between individual patient groups [χ2(2) = 11.014, p = 0.004] but post hoc analysis showed no significant pairwise comparisons. The optimal cut-off score for discriminating between individuals with and without abnormal ViD levels was 0.45 out of 3 (sensitivity 83%, specificity 75%).

Good response was seen in 82.5% of amitriptyline and 62%.5 of melatonin groups and amitriptyline was statistically significant more effective (P=0.04). Severity, duration and Pediatric Migraine Disability Assessment score (PedMIDAS) of headache reduced with melatonin from 6.05±1.63 to 4.03±1.54 scores, from 2.06±1.18 to 1.41± 0.41 hours, and from 33.13±9.17 to 23.38±9.51 scores, respectively. Severity, duration and PedMIDAS of headache decreased with amitriptyline from 6.41±1.67to 2.25±1.21, from 2.55 ±1.85to 0.56±0.51h, and from 31.4±9.33 to 8.28 ± 3.75, respectively (All P &lt; 0.05). Both drugs were effective in reduction of monthly frequency, severity, duration and disability of headache. Daily sleepiness was seen in 7.5% of melatonin group as a side effect and adverse events were seen in 22.5% of amitriptyline group including daily sleepiness in four, constipation in three and fatigue in two children and melatonin was safer than amitriptyline (value = 0.04).Amitriptyline and melatonin are effective and safe in pediatric migraine prophylaxis but amitriptyline can be considered as a more effective drug.">

Evidenced-based options for the treatment of primary headache disorders with preventive medication is limited and clinical outcomes are often unsatisfactory. Greater occipital nerve injections represent a rapid and well-tolerated therapeutic option, which is widely used in clinical practice in adults, and has previously shown a good outcome in a pediatric population.This service evaluation reviewed greater occipital nerve injections performed unilaterally with 30 mg 1% lidocaine and 40 mg methylprednisolone, to treat disabling headache disorders in children and adolescents.We analyzed a total of 159 patients who received 380 injections. Of the population, 79% had chronic migraine, 14% new daily persistent headache, 4% a trigeminal autonomic cephalalgia, 3% secondary headache and one patient had chronic tension-type headache. An improvement after injection was seen in 66% (n = 105) of subjects, lasting on average 9 ± 4 weeks. Improvement was seen in 68% of patients with chronic migraine, 67% with a trigeminal autonomic cephalalgia and 59% with new daily persistent headache. Side effects were reported in 8% and were mild and transient. Older age, female gender, chronic migraine, increased number of past preventive use, medication overuse and developing side effects were all associated with an increased likelihood of positive treatment outcome.This large single centre service evaluation confirms that unilateral injection of the greater occipital nerve is a safe, rapid-onset and effective treatment strategy in disabling headache disorders in children, with a range of diagnoses and severity of the condition, and with minimal side effects.">

        <span class="abst" title="Background: Headache is one of the most common complaints in children and adolescents and comorbidity rates are very high and the major associated diseases are depression, anxiety, atopic disorders, sleep, and behavioral disorders. In recent years, it has been highlighted that difficulties regulating emotions such as alexithymia have also been associated with diagnosis of somatization. Methods: We carried out a mini review analyzing the relation between alexithymia and primary headache (e.g., migraine and tension type headache) in children and adolescents by synthesizing the relevant studies in the literature on PubMed, PsycINFO, and Google Scholar. Search terms were &quot;alexithymia&quot; combined with the &quot;primary headache,&quot; &quot;migraine,&quot; &quot;tension type headache,&quot; &quot;children,&quot; and &quot;adolescents.&quot; Results: All analyzed studies found higher levels of alexithymia in children and adolescents with headache than control groups but there are different opinions about the relationship between headache and alexithymia. For example, some studies suggest that the association between headache and alexithymia in children may be due to an incomplete development of emotive competency or a general immature cognitive development, instead other studies found a correlation between headache symptoms, insecure attachment, and alexithymia. There seems to be also differences between children with migraine compared to those with tension type headache (TTH). Conclusion: There are some studies on adults suffering from headache or migraine and alexithymia, but there is only a moderate amount of research on pediatric age with different opinions and theories about this relationship. Further studies on children and adolescents are necessary to effectively understand this relationship and to help children to reduce headache and improve emotional consciousness.">

All the relevant articles from 1970 to 2016 were included. A total of 120 patients were found in the literature. Most of the cases were seen in the pediatric population with a slight male predominance. Personal or family history of migraine was common. Most patients had a headache prior to the confusional state. In addition to confusion and agitation, some developed visual (32.5%) and/or sensory symptoms (19%) and/or speech problems (39%) either prior to or during the confusional state. Data on treatment outcomes is lacking. Patients with most common forms of migraine report attention and cognitive disturbances but awareness remains intact as opposed to patients with ACM. ACM is a distinct entity and should be included as part of the appendix of International Classification of Headache Disoders-3 beta version (ICHD-3β) criteria.

The latest version of the cognitive battery Leiter International Performance Scale - Third Edition (Leiter-3), a non-verbal test, was administered to 35 children and adolescents affected by migraine or tension-type headache and to 23 healthy subjects. We found that frequency of attacks and headache disability (evaluated with the Pediatric Migraine Disability Assessment Score Questionnaire) significantly correlate with non-verbal memory and sustained attention skills. However, we found that headache disability has a significant impact on specific cognitive domains related to sustained attention and non-verbal memory skills. The relationship between headache and memory/attention deficits may have an explanation based on a possible common physiopathology ground, including noradrenergic and dopaminergic pathways.">

Ninety children with migraine were allocated randomly into 3 groups (placebo, low-dose and high-dose riboflavin). The outcomes (frequency, intensity and duration of headaches) were measured at baseline and 12 weeks of medication in each group, and the decrease of them were compared. SPSS software version 16 was used for analysis of the data. Descriptive statistics, Chi-square, Fisher's exact and t-test were used for statistical analyses.There was a significant decrease of migraine frequency (p=0.000) and mean duration (p=0.000) in the high-dose group compared with the placebo group. No significant reduction of frequency and mean duration of attacks were reported in the low-dose group compared to the placebo group (p=0.49 and p=0.69 respectively). There was no significant reduction of migraine intensity in the low-dose and high-dose groups compared to the placebo group (p=0.71 and p=0.74 respectively).High-dose riboflavin is a safe, well tolerated, cost-effective method of prophylaxis for children with migraine.The trial was registered at the Iranian Clinical Trial Registry with number IRCT2013020412361N1.The study was supported by the Deputy of Research, Kashan University of Medical Sciences (grant number 91073).">

        <span class="abst" title="Abdominal migraine (AM) is a common cause of chronic and recurrent abdominal pain in children. It is characterized by paroxysms of moderate to severe abdominal pain that is midline, periumbilical, or diffuse in location and accompanied by other symptoms including headache, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, or pallor. Despite the presence of comprehensive diagnostic criteria under Rome IV classification of functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) and International Classification of Headache Disorders, it continues to be an underdiagnosed entity.The average age of diagnosis is 3-10 years with peak incidence at 7 years. Most of the patients have a personal or family history of migraine. Pathophysiology of the condition is believed to be similar to that of other FGIDs and cephalic migraine. It is also well recognized as a type of pediatric migraine variant. A careful history, thorough physical examination, and use of well-defined, symptom-based guidelines are needed to make a diagnosis. Selective or no testing is required to support a positive diagnosis. It resolves completely in most of the patients. However, these patients have a strong propensity to develop migraine later in life. Explanation and reassurance should be the first step once the diagnosis is made. Nonpharmacologic treatment options including avoidance of triggers, behavior therapy, and dietary modifications should be the initial line of management. Drug therapy should be considered only if symptoms are refractory to these primary interventions.More research focused on pathophysiology and management of AM needs to be carried out to improve outcomes in affected children.">

        <span class="abst" title="Recurrent abdominal pain (RAP) is one of the most common health complaints in both children and adults. Although RAP is considered a functional disorder rather than an organic disease, affected children and their families can still experience anxiety and concerns that can interfere with school, sports, and regular daily activities and lead to frequent attendances at pediatric emergency departments or pediatric gastroenterology clinics. Our review shows experts do not agree on a universally proven management that will work on every child presenting with functional abdominal pain (FAP). Treatment strategies include both non-pharmacological and pharmacological options. Non-pharmacological treatments are usually very well accepted by both children and their parents and are free from medication side effects. Nevertheless, they may be as effective as the pharmacological interventions; therefore, according to many experts and based on the majority of current evidence, a non-pharmacological approach should be the first intervention attempt in children with RAP. In particular, the importance of the bio-psychosocial approach is highlighted, as a majority of children will improve with counselling and reassurance that no serious organic pathologies are suspected, especially when the physician establishes a trustful relationship with both the child and their family. Placebo and pharmacological interventions could be attempted when the bio-psychosocial approach is not applicable or not efficacious. In some difficult cases, finding an effective treatment for FAP can be a challenge, and a number of strategies may need to be tried before symptoms are controlled. In these cases, a multidisciplinary team, comprising a pediatric gastroenterologist, dietician, psychologist, and psychotherapist, is likely to be successful.">

Recently, an increased prevalence of headache in children and adolescents has been reported.We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of children and adolescents attending the Headache Clinic of Daejeon St. Mary's Hospital during the period from January 2005 through December 2016.The study population consisted of 2466 children, aged between 3 and 18 years (mean age: 10.9). Our study showed an increase in the number of patients visiting the hospital with headaches during the past decade. Compared with 2005, the number of patients with headache increased three-fold in 2016. Interestingly, the proportion of boys, preschool children, and other primary headaches revealed a steady and statistically significant increase.Due to a steady increase in pediatric headaches, the earlier the problem is recognized and properly diagnosed and a treatment plan is established, the greater the likelihood of a better lifelong outcome. Studies are needed to estimate recent trend in prevalence and to identify the demographic and socioeconomic factors predicting the occurrence of headache.">

For the purpose, 279 patients were recruited in different centers in Europe; data were collected by a senior neurologist or ENT specialist through a structured questionnaire. The age of onset of migraine was 21.8 ± 9. The duration of headaches was lower than 24 h in 79.1% of cases. Symptoms accompanying migrainous headaches were, in order of frequency, nausea (79.9%), phonophobia (54.5%), photophobia (53.8%), vomiting (29%), lightheadedness (21.1%). Visual or other auras were reported by 25.4% of subjects. A familial aggregation was referred by 67.4%, while migraine precursors were reported by 52.3% of subjects. Patients reporting nausea and vomiting during headaches more frequently experienced the same symptoms during vertigo. Comparing our results in VM subjects with previously published papers in migraine sufferers, our patients presented a lower duration of headaches and a higher rate of familial aggregation; moreover some common characters were observed in headache and vertigo attacks for accompanying symptoms like nausea and vomiting and clustering of attacks.">

It is possibly associated with mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variants. We examined the phenotype, disease burden, treatment and performed mtDNA analysis in pediatric CVS. METHODS:This retrospective study included 42 children with CVS in a tertiary care center. Information regarding medical history, clinical features, laboratory tests, and treatment were collected. mtDNA sequencing was performed among 13 patients. RESULTS:Mean age of onset among patients was 4.0±3.4 years, and mean age at diagnosis was 6.7±4.2 years. CVS episodes in onset and features were stereotypic. Recognizable prodromes were reported in 54.8% patients. Neuroimaging showed previously unknown intracranial abnormalities. Gastrointestinal infection was found in four patients. Mean duration of hospitalization was 7.0±2.4 days, and mean hospitalization cost was 10,891 RMB. Sequencing showed that 4/13 patients had C16519T mtDNA polymorphism, and 2/13 patients had G3010A mtDNA polymorphism. CONCLUSIONS:Cyclic vomiting syndrome is a disabling disorder, which causes huge disease burdens to the patients and their families. Early clinical suspicion and prompt diagnosis are crucial. mtDNA polymorphisms were found in some patients, but they were not significantly associated with pediatric CVS.">

We aimed to provide new insight into the pathophysiology of postoperative transient neurologic dysfunction.We describe prolonged but fully reversible focal neurologic dysfunction of unknown origin based on the initial evaluation in 8 patients who had received encephalo-duro-arterio-synangiosis for moyamoya disease. We performed brain imaging, including diffusion weighted imaging and perfusion magnetic resonance imaging or single photon emission computed tomography, and electroencephalography (EEG) during the episodes and after resolution of the symptoms.The symptoms consisted of dysarthria, hemiparesis, or hemiparesthesia of limbs contralateral to the operated side. These symptoms developed between 12 hours and 8 days after surgery and lasted between 12 hours and 17 days. Structural imaging did not show any significant interval change compared with the immediate postoperative images. Perfusion imaging showed increased cerebral blood flow in the symptomatic hemisphere. EEG revealed low amplitude arrhythmic slowing in the corresponding hemisphere. Follow-up imaging and EEG after recovery did not show any abnormalities.Transient neurologic dysfunction can occur during the postoperative period of brain surgery. Although this may last more than usual transient ischemic attack or seizure, it eventually resolves regardless of treatment. Based on our observation, we propose that this is the manifestation of the transient cortical depression triggered by mechanical stimulation, analogous to migraine aura associated with cortical spreading depression.">

Materials &amp; Methods:This cross-sectional study was conducted at Booali Hospital, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences, Sari, Iran. Participants with headache and age between 5 and 15 yr were evaluated with MRI and their headache type was diagnosed by the standard criteria. The findings of the MRI were interpreted by a radiologist blinded to the diagnoses. Results:Overall, 81 individuals with symptom of headache and the mean age of 9.56±3.25 yr were enrolled. Twenty patients with the mean age of 9.65±2.75 yr were diagnosed with migraine without aura. Among the 54 male patients, 8 patients (14.8%) were diagnosed with migraine; and among the 27 female patients, 12 patients (44.4%) were diagnosed with migraine (RR: 1.5, 95%CI: 1.07-2.18, P=0.004). Ten migraine patients had abnormal MRI findings (50%), including 8 cases with high signal white matter lesion, and 2 cases with empty sella. The occurrence of the high signal white matter lesions was significantly greater in the migraine patients (RR: 3.91, 95% CI: 2.10-7.25, P=0.001). Conclusion:The possibility of occurrence of the high signal white matter lesions in the brain MRI of children with migraine was significantly higher compared with other headache types.">

The primary aims of the current study were to assess headache prevalence in patients with FD and to assess the association between headaches and mucosal mast cells and eosinophils. An additional aim was to explore associations of headache with other symptoms.We conducted a cross-sectional retrospective chart review of 235 consecutive patients with chronic abdominal pain. All patients had completed a standardized questionnaire as part of their routine clinical evaluation. Both gastrointestinal and non-gastrointestinal somatic symptoms were included in the analysis. All patients diagnosed with FD had undergone upper endoscopy with biopsies obtained from the gastric antrum and duodenum and these specimens were utilized to assess eosinophil and mast cell densities, respectively.Overall, 86% of patients fulfilled Rome IV criteria for FD. Headache was reported by 73.8% of FD patients versus 45.2% of non-FD patients (P = .001). Duodenal mast cell densities were significantly increased in those reporting headaches. Headache was not associated with any specific gastrointestinal symptoms but was associated with a wide array of non-gastrointestinal symptoms including fatigue, dizziness, muscle pain, joint pain, and chest pain.Headaches are common in children and adolescents with abdominal pain and, utilizing Rome IV criteria, are specifically associated with FD. In patients with FD, headaches are associated with increased duodenal mast cell density and a variety of somatic symptoms, all of which are possibly the result of mast cell activation.">

When clinical picture was combined with laboratory finding of macrocytic anemia, a diagnosis of hypothyroidism was made. Although chronic abdominal pain in pediatric population is usually due to functional causes such as irritable bowel syndrome, abdominal migraine and functional abdominal pain. Hypothyroidism can have unusual presentation including abdominal pain. The literature on abdominal pain as the main presentation of thyroid disorder is limited. Pediatricians should exclude hypothyroidism in a patient who presents with chronic abdominal pain. Contrast to its treatment, clinical presentation of hypothyroidism can be diverse and challenging, leading to a delay in diagnosis and causing significant morbidity.Hypothyroidism can have a wide range of clinical presentations that are often nonspecific, which can cause difficulty in diagnosis.In pediatric patients presenting with chronic abdominal pain as only symptom, hypothyroidism should be considered by the pediatricians and ruled out.In pediatric population, treatment of hypothyroidism varies depending on patients' weight and age.Delay in diagnosis of hypothyroidism can cause significant morbidity and distress in pediatrics population.">

The aim of this study is to characterize prospectively the phenotype and prevalence of PA. FINDINGS:Two hundred and twenty-four patients suffering from migraine with aura were recruited from the Headache Centers of Pavia and Trondheim. Patients prospectively described, on an ad hoc diary, each aura symptom (AS), the duration of AS and headache, and headache features. Seventy-two patients recorded three consecutive auras in their diaries. 19 (26.4%) of patients suffered at least one PA. Out of 216 recorded auras, 38 (17.6%) were PAs. We compared PAs with non-PAs with respect to 20 features; PAs were characterized by a higher number of non-visual symptoms (non-VS) (p &lt; 0.001). No other differences were found. We obtained similar results when we compared auras with at least one symptom with a duration of &gt; 2 h (n = 23) or &gt; 4 h (n = 14) with the the others (n = 193 and n = 202 respectively). CONCLUSION:PAs are quite common. They do not differ from the other auras (even when their duration extends to 2 and/or 4 h) with the exception of a higher number of non-VS.">

This study included only patients who had been genotyped for the MTHFR C677T polymorphism. An evaluation of homocysteine serum levels was necessary to exclude other types of migraine. CONCLUSION:Compared with the wild-type genotype, the T/T genotype was associated with an increased risk of any type of migraine, though the statistical significance was greatest in migraine with aura. The homocysteine serum levels were significantly higher in migraine with aura compared to migraine without aura.

We aimed to compare the sleep quality and intensity of headache between school-age children with migraine as well as tension headache and healthy children. Materials &amp; Methods:In this cross-sectional study, 198 children 6-12 yr old in three groups were enrolled from Aug 2015 to Mar 2016. Migraine and tension headache groups from the Outpatient Clinic of Imam Khomeini of Hamadan, western Iran and healthy group from elementary schools were randomly selected (66 children in each group). Data were collected using demographic questionnaire, Child Sleep Habits Questionnaire (CSHQ), Numeric Scale of Pain Intensity and Wong-Baker Faces Pain Rating Scale. The data were analyzed using SPSS by descriptive statistic and multivariate ANOVA, one way ANOVA, Chi-square, Kruskal-Wallis and linear regression tests. Results:Approximately, 45.5% of children with migraine and 37.9% of them with tension headache had experienced severe headache. Only a significant relationship was seen between mean scores of headache intensity and sleep quality in migraine group (P&lt;0.05). There was a significant difference in mean scores of sleep quality among three groups (P&lt;0.001). Conclusion:The children with migraine experienced more unsuitable sleep in duration of severe headache. Highlighting the co-morbidity between intensity of headache and sleep problem of children with migraine and tension headache is important to improve treatment strategies and to know the impact of headache on their normal life.">

        <span class="abst" title="Background: Valproic acid (VPA) and topiramate (TPM), initially developed as antiepileptics, are approved for migraine prophylaxis in adults but not children. The differences in their antimigraine mechanism(s) by age remain unclear. Methods: A migraine model induced by intra-cisternal (i.c.) capsaicin instillation in pediatric (4-5 weeks) and adult (8-9 weeks) rats was pretreated with VPA (30, 100 mg/kg) or TPM (10, 30, 100 mg/kg). Noxious meningeal stimulation by the irritant capsaicin triggered trigeminovascular system (TGVS) activation mimicking migraine condition, which were assessed peripherally by the depletion of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) in sensory nerve fibers of the dura mater, the increased CGRP immunoreactivity at trigeminal ganglia (TG) and centrally by the number of c-Fos-immunoreactive (c-Fos-ir) neurons in the trigeminocervical complex (TCC). Peripherally, CGRP released from dural sensory nerve terminals of TG triggered pain signal transmission in the primary afferent of trigeminal nerve, which in turn caused central sensitization of the TGVS due to TCC activation and hence contributed to migraine. Results: In the VPA-treated group, the central responsiveness expressed by reducing the number of c-Fos-ir neurons, which had been increased by i.c. capsaicin, was significant in pediatric, but not adult, rats. Inversely, VPA was effective in peripheral inhibition of elevated CGRP immunoreactivity in the TG and CGRP depletion in the dura mater of adult, but not pediatric, rats. In TPM group, the central responsiveness was significant in both adult and pediatric groups. Peripherally, TPM significantly inhibited capsaicin-induced CGRP expression of TG in adult, but not pediatric, rats. Interestingly, the capsaicin-induced depletion of CGRP in dura was significantly rescued by TPM at high doses in adults, but at low dose in pediatric group. Conclusion: These results suggest VPA exerted peripheral inhibition in adult, but central suppression in pediatric migraine-rats. In contrast, TPM involves both central and peripheral inhibition of migraine with an optimal therapeutic window in both ages. These findings may clarify the age-dependent anti-migraine mechanism of VPA and TPM, which may guide the development of new pediatric anti-migraine drugs in the future.">

        <span class="abst" title="Background:Migraine headache without aura is the most common type of migraine especially among pediatric patients. It has always been a great challenge of migraine diagnosis using quantitative electroencephalography measurements through feature classification. It has been proven that different feature extraction and classification methods vary in terms of performance regarding detection and diagnostic accuracy. Previous work on the subject was controversial, hence a comparison of these methods seems necessary. Objective:The aim of this research is to compare two parametric and non-parametric feature extraction methods and also two classification methods in order to obtain optimal combinations of diagnostic accuracy. Materials and Methods:Having recorded background EEG from 24 pediatric migraineurs and 19 control subjects, data was processed by Welch's and Yule-Walker's methods. Features were selected using genetic algorithm, and then given to a support vector machine and the linear discriminant analysis for the classification. Accuracy was calculated for all combinations having the dominant frequency and the correlated absolute power of each EEG wave band (theta, alpha, and beta) and for all wave bands combined. Results:The highest migraine detection accuracy of 93% was obtained utilizing Welch's method for EEG feature extraction alongside support vector machine for a classifier. Besides, Yule-Walker autoregressive method showed better performance than Welch's, when only power bands (and not the dominant frequency) were used as classification input. Conclusion:The superiority of Welch's method over Yule-Walker's and the support vector machine over linear discriminant analysis can be great help for further researches on computer aided EEG-based diagnosis of migraine.">

Regression model found that only significant factor associated with improvement of symptoms is the establishment of the functional diagnosis at the first visit (hazard ratio, 2.163; 95% confidence inverval, 1.029-4.544). There was no association between improvement of symptoms and presence of alarm signs/symptoms (weight loss, nocturnal symptoms and severe vomiting) at diagnosis. Furthermore, in pain symptoms (functional abdominal pain, irritable bowel syndrome, dyspepsia) no treatment positively correlated with pain improvement. Conclusion:Regardless of the initial diagnosis of FGID, positive diagnosis at the first visit increases a chance for resolution of symptoms.">

        <span class="abst" title="BACKGROUND:Migraine and Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) have been found to be associated in child and adolescent cohorts; however, the association has not been assessed in adults or otherwise healthy population. Assessing the comorbidity between ADHD and migraine may clarify the etiopathology of both diseases. Thus, the objective is to assess whether migraine (with and without visual disturbances) and ADHD are comorbid disorders. METHODS:Participants from the Danish Blood Donor Study (N = 26,456, age 18-65, 46% female) were assessed for migraine and ADHD using the ASRS ver 1.1 clinically validated questionnaire and self-reported migraine in a cross-sectional study. Logistic regression was used to examine the comorbidity between migraine and ADHD, and their associated endophenotypes. RESULTS:Migraine was strongly associated with ADHD (OR = 1.8, 95% CI = 1.5-2.1), (238/6152 vs 690/19,376). There was a significant interaction between age and gender, with comorbidity increasing with age and female sex. Post-hoc analysis showed that migraine with visual disturbance was generally associated with a marginally higher risk of ADHD and this was independent of ADHD endophenotypes. CONCLUSION:Migraine and ADHD were demonstrated to be comorbid disorders; the association with ADHD was most prominent for participants with migraine with visual disturbances. Future studies will elucidate which genetic and environmental factors contribute to migraine-ADHD comorbidity.">

        <span class="abst" title="Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is characterized by intracranial pressure &gt;28 cmH2O in the absence of identifiable causes. Aim of this paper is to describe the clinical phenotype of pediatric IIH and to analyze the applicability of ICHD-3 criteria in comparison to the ICHD-2. We conducted a retrospective analysis of full clinical data of pediatric patients diagnosed with IIH between January 2007 and June 2018. Diagnostic evaluation included neuroimaging (all patients) and ultrasound-based optic nerve sheath diameter measurement (9 patients). Diagnosis of IIH was verified according to both ICHD-2 and ICHD-3 criteria for headache attributed to IIH, to verify the degree of concordance. We identified 41 subjects with suspected IIH; 14 were excluded due a diagnosis of secondary IH or lack of data. We therefore selected 27 subjects (age 4-15 years, mean 11). All patients presented with headache and bilateral papilloedema. Headache was daily in 22% cases, with diffuse gravative pain in 41%. In 4%, pain was exacerbated by cough, stress or tension. The most common presentation symptoms, in addition to headache, were blurred vision or diplopia (70%), vomiting (33%), and dizziness (15%). Twenty patients (74%) were obese. In 6 patients (22%) neuroimaging showed empty sella. Optic nerve sheath distension was detected in 6 out of 9 patients. Regarding the applicability of the ICHD-2 criteria, 18/27 (71%) patients have criterion A; 24/27 (89%) criterion B; 27/27 (100%) criterion C; 27/27 (100%) criterion D. When the ICHD-3 criteria were used, 27/27 (100%) fitted criterion A; 24/27 (89%) criterion B; 27/27 (100%) criterion C; and 27/27 (100%) criterion D. Our study suggests that, as compared with the ICHD-2, the new ICHD-3 criteria for headache attributed to IIH are better satisfied by pediatric patients with IIH. This is mainly due to the fact that qualitative headache characteristics are no longer considered in ICHD-3. Although the risk of under-rating the symptom of headache in IIH should not be disregarded, in pediatric population headache characteristics are usually less defined than in adults and obtaining a precise description of them is often very difficult.">

The objectives were to establish the prevalence of each entity amongst the other, to explore the role of gluten free diet (GFD), and to describe the imaging findings in those affected by headaches associated with CD. METHODOLOGY:A systematic computer-based literature search was conducted on the PubMed database. Information regarding study type, population size, the age group included, prevalence of CD amongst those with headache and vice versa, imaging results, the nature of headache, and response to GFD. RESULTS:In total, 40 articles published between 1987 and 2017 qualified for inclusion in this review. The mean pooled prevalence of headache amongst those with CD was 26% (95% CI 19.5⁻33.9%) in adult populations and 18.3% (95% CI 10.4⁻30.2%) in paediatric populations. The headaches are most often migraine-like. In children with idiopathic headache, the prevalence of CD is 2.4% (95% CI 1.5⁻3.7%), whereas data for adult populations is presently unavailable. Brain imaging can be normal, although, cerebral calcifications on CT, white matter abnormalities on MRI and deranged regional cerebral blood flow on SPECT can be present. GFD appears to be an effective management for headache in the context of CD, leading to total resolution of headaches in up to 75% of patients. CONCLUSIONS:There is an increased prevalence of CD amongst idiopathic headache and vice versa. Therefore, patients with headache of unknown origin should be screened for CD, as such patients may symptomatically benefit from a GFD.">

This study aimed to identify the characteristics of headache in children &lt;7 years of age. METHODS:We reviewed 3 years of clinical files on children &lt;7 years of age with a chief complaint of headache. RESULTS:This study included 146 children (66 males, 80 females; mean age, 5.5±1.0 years). Mean symptom duration was 5.8±7.9 months. Attack durations were longer than 2 hours in 31 patients, shorter than 2 hours in 70 patients, and unchecked in 45 patients. Attack frequency was 15.1±10.6 times per month. Pain locations and characteristics were also variable. Mean pain severity score was 5.1±2.2 on the visual analog scale. Of 38 patients who underwent electroencephalography, 9 showed positive findings. Of 41 who underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging, 20 showed positive findings. The diagnoses were migraine (including probable migraine) in 34, tension-type headache in 5, and congenital malformations in 3. Medications were used in 29 patients: acetaminophen in 17, ibuprofen in 8, naproxen sodium in 1, and topiramate or amitriptyline in 3. CONCLUSION:In children aged &lt;7 years, headache has a relatively benign course, but detailed history taking is needed for more accurate diagnosis.">

        <span class="abst" title="Headache disorders are common in children and adolescents. Most of the studies on non-pharmacological treatments have however been carried out on adults. In this review we provide information on recent studies examining non-pharmacological approaches for managing headache in children and adolescents. Our search of SCOPUS for primary studies conducted between January 2010 and July 2018 uncovered 11 controlled studies, mostly addressing behavioral approaches, in which a total of 613 patients with a diagnosis of primary headache, and average age 10.2-15.7 years (30-89% females) were recruited. Non-pharmacological treatments were shown to produce sizeable effects on the classical primary endpoint, i.e., headache frequency, with reductions from baseline ranging between 34 and 78%. Among commonly reported secondary endpoints, particularly disability, quality of life, depression and anxiety, marked improvements were noted as well. Taken as a whole, our findings suggest that non-pharmacological treatments constitute a valid option for the prevention of primary headaches in young age. Future research with higher-quality studies is needed. Particular attention needs to be given to studies that randomize patients to condition, blind researchers in charge of evaluating treatment outcomes, routinely include headache frequency as the primary endpoint, include adequate-length follow-up, address changes in biomarkers of disease and other possible mediators of outcome, and that employ predictive models to enhance the level of evidence for these approaches.">

The Rivermead Post-concussion Symptoms Questionnaire (RPQ) is a simple, freely available, and widely used tool for assessment of the presence and severity of various post-concussion symptoms. We aimed to probe the prevalence among athletes of symptom classes associated with identified concussion phenotypes using the RPQ at baseline and acutely after a concussion. Participants of organized sports aged 12-30 years were baseline-assessed with the expectation that some would experience a concussion during the study period. Concussed athletes were re-assessed within 2 weeks of their injuries. The RPQ was supplemented with three specific questions and reworded for baseline assessment. A binomial test was used to contrast the prevalence of an attribute in the concussed cohort against the probability established by the baseline observation. Three thousand and eighty-eight athletes were baseline-assessed and eighty-nine were re-assessed post-concussion. All concussed athletes endorsed having some elevated symptoms in the RPQ, and such endorsements were more prevalent than those among normal athletes. Moderate-to-severe post-concussion symptoms of specific classes tended to be endorsed with few additional symptoms of other classes of similar intensities. Elevated symptoms detected with the RPQ within as short as 2 weeks after a concussion may help delineate patients' clinical subtypes and guide their treatment. Further refinement of symptom questionnaires and use of objective measures will be needed to properly populate the concussion subtype classification.">

Data were collected using translated and validated self-administered questionnaires (Rome III questionnaire, International Study on Asthma and Allergies in Childhood questionnaire, and Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory 4.0) and administered under an examination setting after obtaining parental consent and assent. RESULTS:Of the 1101 children included in the analysis, 157 (14.3%) had asthma and 101 (9.2%) had at least one FAPDs. Of children with asthma, 19.1% had at least one type of FAPDs. Prevalence rates of functional abdominal pain (FAP) (8.9% vs 3.3% in non-asthmatics), functional dyspepsia (FD) (2.5% vs 0.7%), and abdominal migraine (AM) (3.2% vs 0.4%) were higher in those with asthma (P &lt; 0.05, multiple logistic regression analysis), but not in those with irritable bowel syndrome (4.5% vs 3.1%, P = 0.2). Severe abdominal pain (10.8% vs 4.6%), bloating (16.6% vs 9.6%), nausea (6.4% vs 2.9%), and anorexia (24.2% vs 16.2%) were more prevalent among asthmatics (P &lt; 0.05). Lower gastrointestinal symptoms did not show a significant difference. Scores obtained for health related quality of life (HRQoL) were lower in those with asthma and FAPDs (P &lt; 0.05, unpaired t-test). CONCLUSION:Asthma is associated with three different types of FAPDs, namely, FD, AM, and FAP. HRQoL is significantly impaired in teenagers with asthma and FAPDs.">

It must also incorporate the management of common psychiatric and neurologic comorbidities, affecting on average between 30 and 50% of patients with epilepsy, which have a significant impact on their lives at various levels, including quality of life and the prognosis of the seizure disorder. Mood and anxiety disorders are the most frequent psychiatric comorbidities, whereas stroke and migraine are among the more common neurologic comorbidities, migraine among the younger patients and stroke among the older patients. Not only do these psychiatric and neurologic comorbidities each have a bidirectional relation with epilepsy, but primary mood disorders have a bidirectional relation with these 2 neurologic disorders.

        <span class="abst" title="PURPOSE:The association between GRIA1 rs548294 G&gt;A and rs2195450 C&gt;T polymorphisms and migraine risk has been reported in several case-control studies. However, the results of studies are inconsistent. Thus, we conducted a meta-analysis to more precisely estimate the association of the two polymorphisms with migraine risk. METHODS:Eligible studies were retrieved and screened from the online databases (EMBASE, PubMed, Web of Science, Wanfang, and Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure). The pooled odds ratio (OR) with corresponding 95.0% confidence intervals (CIs) was assessed using random- or fixed-effects model. RESULTS:A total of 1233 cases and 1374 controls from four eligible studies were included. The pooled analysis showed that GRIA1 rs548294 G&gt;A polymorphism was not significantly associated with migraine risk. GRIA1 rs2195450 C&gt;T polymorphism was significantly associated with migraine risk under heterozygous model (CT vs. CC, OR = 1.23, 95%CI = 1.02-1.48, P Z = 0.03). Further subgroup analysis based on ethnicity showed a significant association of GRIA1 rs2195450 C&gt;T polymorphism with migraine risk in Asian population, but not in Caucasian population. CONCLUSIONS:Our results indicates that GRIA1 rs2195450 C&gt;T polymorphism is significantly associated with migraine risk. However, the number of studies included in the meta-analysis was small. Thus, more high quality case-control studies with a large sample size are still required to confirm these findings.">

Early research of pediatric integrative medicine modalities shows promise for the treatment of common pediatric conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome, acute and chronic pain, headache, and allergy, among others. In light of the growing prevalence of pediatric illnesses and patient complexity, it is crucial to emphasize the patient's overall well-being. As academic centers around the world start to develop pediatric integrative medicine programs, the aim of this manuscript is to briefly highlight evidence of effective integrative treatments in pediatric subspecialties, to describe the establishment of our integrative medicine program, to summarize its early efforts, and to discuss potential barriers and keys to success.">

        <span class="abst" title="Objective: Prostaglandin I2 receptor plays a major physiologic role in the relaxation of arterial smooth muscle and vasodilation and possibly during migraine attacks. Therefore, in this study, the coding and noncoding exons and exon-intron boundaries of Prostaglandin I2 receptor gene were examined in patients with migraine headache and healthy controls and the potential effects of identified single nucleotide variations were evaluated using direct PCR-sequencing and in silico analysis. Method : In this study, the peripheral blood samples of 50 patients and 50 controls were examined to find any mutation in coding and noncoding exons and exon-intron boundaries of PTGIR gene. DNA was extracted and all the samples were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequenced. Results: In this study, the patients had a mean age of 35.235 ± 10.99 years (range, 9-60 yrs.), and female to male ratio was 4:1 in this group. The controls had a mean age of 35.058 ± 11.116 years (range, 8-59 yrs.), and female to male ratio was 3.7:1.3 in this group. Two patients had mutations in exon 2. The first mutation was located in exon 2 (at amino acid position 251) of PTGIR gene at nucleotide position c.866A &gt; T, a synonymous variant described previously in the database. The second mutation was located in exon 2 c.867G &gt; A, which is a missense variant. Sequence analysis revealed high occurrence of previously reported intronic variants mostly in a homozygous statue. Conclusion: The data supported the hypothesis that mutations in PTGIR gene, particularly the mutation we described, should be considered even in cases of migraine. The presence of this mutation in patients with family history raises important issues regarding genetic counselling.">

        <span class="abst" title="Propranolol is a beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist that was developed by the British scientist Sir James Black primarily for the treatment of angina pectoris, more than 50 years ago. It was not long before several other cardiovascular as well as noncardiovascular therapeutic uses of propranolol were discovered. Propranolol soon became a powerful tool for physicians in the treatment of numerous conditions such as hypertension, cardiac arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, migraine, portal hypertension, anxiety, essential tremors, hyperthyroidism, and pheochromocytoma. Owing to its action at multiple receptor sites, propranolol exerts several central and peripheral effects and is therefore useful in various conditions. Right from reduction in postmyocardial mortality to control of anxiety in performers, propranolol plays an important role in a plethora of medical conditions. Interestingly, even today, newer indications of this age-old drug are being discovered. Moreover, propranolol treatment has been found to be cost-effective when compared to other corresponding treatment options for individual indications. In this article, we attempt to recount the journey of propranolol right from its inception to the present day.">

There was point tenderness on palpitation over the left trochlear region without swelling or redness. Orbital magnetic resonance imaging showed focal enhancement on the left trochlea and paranasal sinusitis on the left side. The patient's symptoms and signs were completely resolved after empirical treatment for sinusitis. There was no need to inject a local steroid.

Our understanding of sleep following concussion is less well understood within a pediatric population. In this study, we investigated the trajectory of sleep and daytime sleepiness in a prospective cohort of 40 children and youth (6-18 years old) with concussion, 40 age-and sex-matched healthy children and youth, and 40 with upper-extremity orthopedic injury. Evaluations occurred during the acute stage (&lt;2 weeks) and at 3-, 6-, and 12-month postinjury using the Sleep Disturbance Scale for Children and the Postconcussion Symptom Scale. There were no significant differences within- or between-group differences in sleep across all four time points with analysis of the groups as a whole. When groups were divided by age (6-11 and 12- &lt; 18 years), there was a significant difference in the ability to initiate sleep for the younger concussed group during the acute stage, compared with healthy controls, as well as significantly greater daytime nap duration that decreased over time. Significant correlations were also found between the frequency and duration of daytime naps and Postconcussion Symptom Scale total score and subscores (cognitive, physical/migraine, mood, and sleep) in the concussed group during the acute stage. Our results suggest that in a group with noncomplicated concussion, children and youth have transient alterations in daytime sleepiness that are related to concussion symptoms. Younger children may be more vulnerable to disturbances in sleep and daytime wakefulness.">

        <span class="abst" title="Background: Plasma calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) plays a key role in the migraine pathophysiology. This study aimed to investigate its role in predicting diagnosis and outcome of pharmacotherapy in pediatric migraine. Methods: We prospectively recruited 120 subjects, who never took migraine-preventive agents in a pediatric clinic, including 68 patients with migraine, 30 with non-migraine headache (NM), and 22 non-headache (NH) age-matched controls. Short-term therapeutic response was measured for at least 2 weeks after the start of therapy. Responders were defined with &gt;50% headache reduction. Plasma CGRP concentrations were measured by ELISA. Results: In the migraine group, more patients required acute therapy, as compared to the NM group (62/68, 91% vs. 5/30, 15%, p = 0.001). The mean plasma CGRP level in migraineurs either during (291 ± 60 pg/ml) or between (240 ± 48) attacks was higher than in NM patients (51 ± 5 pg/ml, p = 0.006 and 0.018, respectively) and NH controls (53 ± 6 pg/ml, p = 0.016 and 0.045, respectively). Forty-seven patients (69%) needed preventive treatments and had higher plasma CGRP levels (364 ± 62 pg/ml, n = 47) than those not (183 ± 54 pg/ml, n = 21) (p = 0.031). Topiramate responders had higher plasma CGRP levels than non-responders (437 ± 131 pg/ml, n = 14 vs. 67 ± 19 pg/ml, n = 6, p = 0.021). Survival curves of plasma CGRP levels also showed those with higher CGRP levels responded better to topiramate. Differences were not found in the other preventives. Conclusion: The plasma CGRP level can differentiate migraine from non-migraine headache. It may also serve as a reference for the therapeutic strategy since it is higher in patients requiring migraine prevention and responsive to short-term topiramate treatment. These results are clinically significant, especially for the young children who cannot clearly describe their headache symptoms and may provide new insights into the clinical practice for the diagnosis and treatment of pediatric migraine.">

She had mild leukocytosis and bandemia, but her imaging and cerebrospinal studies were unrevealing. After five days, her symptoms resolved and she was discharged home on doxycycline due to suspicion for Bartonella encephalitis. The patient admitted to playing with a kitten two months prior, but she lacked the classic regional lymphadenopathy. Bartonella titers were sent during her hospitalization and returned positive after her discharge. Cat scratch disease neurologic manifestations are uncommon, with hemiplegia being exceedingly rare. This case illustrates that focal neurologic signs may develop during cat scratch disease infection and suggests that cat scratch disease encephalitis should be considered during evaluation of a pediatric patient with acute flaccid paralysis.">

        <span class="abst" title="Pediatric concussion patients living in northern communities in Canada can face unique challenges accessing primary and specialized healthcare. In this study we report the clinical characteristics, healthcare utilization, outcomes and estimated cost avoidance associated with a pilot pediatric concussion telemedicine program established between a multi-disciplinary pediatric concussion program in Winnipeg, Manitoba and a hospital in Thompson, Manitoba. From October 1st- July 1st, 2018, 20 patients were evaluated; mean age 13.1 years, 15 (75%) males and 14 (70%) self-identified as Indigenous. Injury mechanisms included hockey (50%), falls (35%) and assaults (15%). Median time from referral to initial consultation was 2.0 days. After screening by the neurosurgeon, 90% of patients underwent initial consultation via real-time videoconferencing with 80% managed exclusively through telemedicine. At the end of the study, 90% met the criteria for clinical recovery, one remained in treatment and one was discharged to a headache neurologist. Sixty-six telemedicine encounters were completed including 57 videoconferencing appointments and 9 telephone follow-ups representing an estimated cost avoidance of $40,972.94. This study suggests telemedicine may be a useful approach to assist pediatric concussion programs with delivering timely, safe and cost-effective care to patients living in medically underserviced remote and northern communities in Canada.">

MATERIALS AND METHODS:A cross-sectional study was conducted with 1342 adolescents aged 10-17 years. The Research Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders (RDC/TMD) was used by calibrated examiners to evaluate the presence and levels of chronic pain. To evaluate the socioeconomic conditions, the subjects answered the Brazilian Economic Classification Criteria (CCEB) questionnaire. Data were analyzed by means of binary logistic regression in SPSS. RESULTS:The results showed that 33.2% of the subjects had TMD irrespective of age (p = 0.153) or economic class (p = 0.653). Statistically significant associations were found between TMD and female gender (p = 0.017), headache/migraine in the past six months (p&lt;0.001), chronic pain (p&lt;0.001) and chronic pain level (p&lt;0.001). In the final model, logistic regression showed that the level of chronic pain and the headache/migraine in the past six months were related to the presence of TMD. CONCLUSIONS:The prevalence of TMD was considered high (33.2%) and adolescents with chronic pain and headache in the past six months were more likely to have TMD. CLINICAL RELEVANCE:The data contribute to the understanding of TMD among adolescents and to the development of preventive measures and polices to identify the dysfunction promptly.">

        <span class="abst" title="For the past 10 years, the annual 'Antibodies to watch' articles have provided updates on key events in the late-stage development of antibody therapeutics, such as first regulatory review or approval, that occurred in the year before publication or were anticipated to occur during the year of publication. To commemorate the 10th anniversary of the article series and to celebrate the 2018 Nobel Prizes in Chemistry and in Physiology or Medicine, which were given for work that is highly relevant to antibody therapeutics research and development, we expanded the scope of the data presented to include an overview of all commercial clinical development of antibody therapeutics and approval success rates for this class of molecules. Our data indicate that: 1) antibody therapeutics are entering clinical study, and being approved, in record numbers; 2) the commercial pipeline is robust, with over 570 antibody therapeutics at various clinical phases, including 62 in late-stage clinical studies; and 3) Phase 1 to approval success rates are favorable, ranging from 17-25%, depending on the therapeutic area (cancer vs. non-cancer). In 2018, a record number (12) of antibodies (erenumab (Aimovig), fremanezumab (Ajovy), galcanezumab (Emgality), burosumab (Crysvita), lanadelumab (Takhzyro), caplacizumab (Cablivi), mogamulizumab (Poteligeo), moxetumomab pasudodox (Lumoxiti), cemiplimab (Libtayo), ibalizumab (Trogarzo), tildrakizumab (Ilumetri, Ilumya), emapalumab (Gamifant)) that treat a wide variety of diseases were granted a first approval in either the European Union (EU) or United States (US). As of November 2018, 4 antibody therapeutics (sacituzumab govitecan, ravulizumab, risankizumab, romosozumab) were being considered for their first marketing approval in the EU or US, and an additional 3 antibody therapeutics developed by Chinese companies (tislelizumab, sintilimab, camrelizumab) were in regulatory review in China. In addition, our data show that 3 product candidates (leronlimab, brolucizumab, polatuzumab vedotin) may enter regulatory review by the end of 2018, and at least 12 (eptinezumab, teprotumumab, crizanlizumab, satralizumab, tanezumab, isatuximab, spartalizumab, MOR208, oportuzumab monatox, TSR-042, enfortumab vedotin, ublituximab) may enter regulatory review in 2019. Finally, we found that approximately half (18 of 33) of the late-stage pipeline of antibody therapeutics for cancer are immune checkpoint modulators or antibody-drug conjugates. Of these, 7 (tremelimumab, spartalizumab, BCD-100, omburtamab, mirvetuximab soravtansine, trastuzumab duocarmazine, and depatuxizumab mafodotin) are being evaluated in clinical studies with primary completion dates in late 2018 and in 2019, and are thus 'antibodies to watch'. We look forward to documenting progress made with these and other 'antibodies to watch' in the next installment of this article series.">

This narrative review consolidates the literature on postconcussive emotional and psychosocial functioning in school-aged children and adolescents, highlighting athlete-specific findings. MEDLINE and PsycINFO databases were queried for pediatric concussion studies examining psychological and/or social outcomes, and 604 studies met search criteria (11 of those specific to sport). Results were organized into domains: emotional and social dysfunction, behavioral problems, academic difficulties, sleep disturbance, headache, and quality of life. The small body of literature regarding psychological and social issues following pediatric concussion suggests behavioral disturbances at least temporarily disrupt daily life. Extrapolation from samples of athletes and nonathletes indicates postconcussive anxiety and depressive symptoms appear, although levels may be subclinical. Social and academic findings were less clear. Future well-controlled and adequately powered research will be essential to anticipate concussed athletes' psychosocial needs.">

        <span class="abst" title="Background: Migraine is the most common cause of primary headache in children leading to a decrease in the quality of life. During the last decade, pain catastrophizing construct became a major focus of interest in the study and treatment of pain. Aim of the study: To evaluate pain catastrophizing in episodic and chronic migraine children and adolescents selected in a tertiary headache Center.To test whether the children's pain catastrophizing might be associated (a) with the frequency of attacks and disability (b) with psychopathological aspects (c) with allodynia and total tenderness score as symptom of central sensitization.To test the best discriminating clinical variables and scores between episodic and chronic migraine, including pain catastrophizing. Methods: We conducted a cross sectional observational study on consecutive pediatric patients affected by migraine. We selected 190 headache patients who met the diagnostic criteria for Migraine without aura, Migraine with aura and Chronic migraine. We submitted all children to the Child version of the Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS-C), and to the disability scale for migraine (PedMIDAS), general quality of life estimated by children (PedsQL) and parents (PedsQL-P), anxiety and depression (SAFA-A; SAFA-D) scales. We also evaluated headache frequency and the presence and severity of allodynia and pericranial tenderness. Results: No difference was detected in Total Pain Catastrophizing score (PCS-C) between chronic and episodic migraine groups (ANOVA F = 0.59, p = 0.70); the PedMIDAS, the PedsQL-P for physical functioning and the Total Tenderness Score were discriminant variables between episodic and chronic migraine. The PCS-C was not correlated with migraine related disability as expressed by Ped MIDAS, but it was significantly correlated with general low quality of life, allodynia, pericranial tenderness, anxiety, and depression. Conclusion: Pain catastrophizing seems a mental characteristic of a clinical phenotype with psychopathological traits and enhanced expression of central sensitization symptoms. This clinical profile causes general decline in quality of life in the child judgment, with a probable parents' underestimation. In childhood age, it would not be a feature of chronic migraine, but the possibility that it could predict this evolution is consistent and worthy of further prospective evaluation.">

Our aims were to investigate the clinical features of chronic headache and usefulness of the International Classification of Headache Disorders 3rd edition (ICHD 3) criteria for the diagnosis in a cohort of pediatric patients. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the charts of patients attending the Headache Center of Bambino Gesù Children and Insubria University Hospital during the 2010-2016 time interval. Statistical analysis was conducted to study possible correlations between: (a) chronic primary headache (CPH) and demographic data (age and sex), (b) CPH and headache qualitative features, (c) CPH and risk of medication overuse headache (MOH), and (d) CPH and response to prophylactic therapies. Moreover, we compared the diagnosis obtained by ICHD 3 vs. ICHD 2 criteria Results: We included 377 patients with CPH (66.4% females, 33.6% males, under 18 years of age). CPH was less frequent under 6 years of age (0.8%; p &lt; 0.05) and there was no correlation between age/sex and different CPH types. The risk to develop MOH was higher after 15 years of age (p &lt; 0.05). When we compared the diagnosis obtained by ICHD 2 and ICHD 3 criteria we found a significant difference for the undefined diagnosis (2.6% vs. 7.9%; p &lt; 0.05), while the diagnosis of probable chronic migraine was only possible by using the ICHD2 criteria (11.9% of patients; p &lt; 0.05). The main criterion which was not satisfied for a definitive diagnosis was the duration of the attacks less than 2 h (70% of patients younger than 6 years; p &lt; 0.005). Amitriptyline and topiramate were the most effective drugs (p &lt; 0.05), although no significant difference was found between them (p &gt; 0.05). Conclusion: The ICHD 3 criteria show limitations when applied to children under 6 years of age. The risk of developing MOH increases with age. Although our &quot;real word&quot; study shows that amitriptyline and topiramate are the most effective drugs regardless of the CPH type, the lack of placebo-controlled data and the limited follow-up results did not allow us to conclude about the drug efficacy.">

This was a prospective study, which started together with the implementation of a national program of pediatric interventional cardiology in Romania. We used Cocoon devices in 83 consecutive cases from 92 implantations for ASD and PDA. 27 cases were ASD closure and 56 cases PDA closure. Regarding the ASD closure, the median age was 8.5 years (range 3-25 years) and median weight 25 kg (range 11.5-63 kg). The mean follow-up was 17.4 ± 6.7 months (range 3-26 months). The mean ASD diameter by transesophageal echocardiography was 15.2 ± 4.1 mm (range 8-26 mm). The mean device diameter used was 17.3 ± 5.6 mm (range 8-32 mm). Regarding the PDA closure, the median age was 36 months (range 4-192 months) and median weight 14 kg (range 5-58 kg). The mean follow-up was 15 ± 8 months (range 3-28 months). The mean PDA minimum diameter was 2.5 ± 0.8 mm. The success implantation rate for both groups was 97.6% (2 cases of withdrawn for ASD and PDA), while the complication rate was 2.3% (including 2 ASD device embolization). In the first 24 hours, the closure rates were 96.3% for ASD, 98.2% for PDA, and 100% at 1-month follow-up for both procedures. On short and intermediate follow-up (3-28 months), no device-related complications were noted.The Cocoon devices are safe for transcatheter closure of both ASD and PDA, and the initial experience with their use in our emerging center is encouraging.">

        <span class="abst" title="BACKGROUND:Migraine is one of the most prevalent chronic pain manifestations of childhood. Despite the multitude of available treatments, parents are often concerned about chronic therapies and pediatricians have insufficient confidence in prescribing prophylactic drugs. Therefore, there is now growing interest for natural supplements used to control recurrent migraine headaches. Such approach may increase acceptance and adherence to long-term prophylaxis therapy in children. METHODS:This is an observational multicenter study performed in children (n = 91) with migraine, with (MO) or without aura (MA), or tension-type headache (TTH). A fixed-dose Andrographis paniculata, CoQ10, riboflavin, and magnesium, was administered for 16 weeks. Patients were evaluated at baseline (T0), at week 8 (T1) and at the end of treatment at week 16 (T2). A follow-up period occurred at week 20 (T3) and week 32 (T4). RESULTS:The herbal supplement significantly reduced the frequency of headaches in TTH patients during treatment period (T0: 11.97 + 1.92 vs T2: 5.13 + 1.93; p &lt; 0.001) and the efficacy was maintained after 16 weeks of treatment withdrawal (T4: 4.46 + 1.75; p &lt; 0.001 vs T0). The frequency of migraine attacks was also reduced in the MO group during treatment (T0: 9.70 + 0.96 vs T2: 4.03 + 0.75; p &lt; 0.01) and after withdrawal (T4: 2.96 + 0.65; p &lt; 0.01 vs T0). Conversely, MA patients showed reduction in migraine's frequency during treatment (T0: 8.74 + 1.91 vs T2: 3.78 + 2.02; p &lt; 0.01) but not at the end of the study (T4: 5.57 + 3.31; p &gt; 0.05 vs T0). TTH patients did not report significant improvement of pain intensity. A significant effect was observed in the MO group during treatment (T0: 3.06 + 0.11 vs T2: 2.14 + 0.19; p &lt; 0.001) and after treatment withdrawal (T4: 2.20 + 0.21; p &lt; 0.001 vs T0). Likewise, MA group showed a significant treatment effect (T0: 2.57 + 0.20 vs T2: 0.86 + 0.45; p &lt; 0.001) and the efficacy persisted at the end of the study (T4: 1.00 + 0.58; p &lt; 0.001 vs T0). CONCLUSION:This fixed-dose Tanacetum parthenium preparation improved headache frequency and pain intensity in children affected by TTH. Despite the main limits, this study supports the use of nutraceutical in pediatric headache/migraine.">

        <span class="abst" title="Few studies have been conducted on the prodromal and postdromal phases of the migraine attack in children and adolescents. Using a questionnaire, we found that 67% of 103 children and adolescents with migraine reported at least one prodromal symptom, with a mean number per subject of 1.8 (median 2.2). The most frequently reported prodromal symptoms were face changes, fatigue and irritability. In pediatric patients selected as having prodrome, fatigue, mood change and neck stiffness were the most frequently reported prodromal symptoms. Using a different design, Laurell et al. found that 71% of 137 pediatric patients reported at least one prodromal symptom with a mean number per subject of 1.9 ± 2.0. Studying postdrome was fraught with unexpected difficulties as our preliminary research showed. Patients reported 2 groups of symptoms occurring during the resolution phase of the headache: symptoms whose onset was before headache cessation and were persisting after it, and symptoms whose onset was after headache cessation. We referred to the former as persistent symptoms and to the latter as true postdromes. Ninety-one per cent of patients reported persistent symptoms, with a mean of 6.0 and a median of 2, asthenia, pallor, cognitive difficulties, anorexia, somnolence, and nausea being the more frequently reported. True postdromes were reported by 82% of patients, with a mean of 2.6 and a median of 2, thirst, somnolence, visual disturbances, food craving, paraesthesias, and ocular pain being the most frequent reported. Interestingly, several prodromal and postdromal symptoms are also encountered during the aura classic and/or accompany the headache phase. Functional imaging in migraine has showed that the activations in areas such as hypothalamus or brainstem may begin before headache onset and/or persist after headache relief. Thus, one may wonder whether prodromal and postdromal symptoms may indicate the involvement of the limbic system, dopaminergic pathways, the hypothalamus and the brainstem. Differences between children, adolescents and adults might contribute to the understanding of migraine neurobiology.">

        <span class="abst" title="BACKGROUND:Headaches are a common source of pain and suffering. The study's purpose was to assess beta-blockers efficacy in preventing migraine and tension-type headache. METHODS:Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials; MEDLINE; EMBASE; ISI Web of Science, clinical trial registries, CNKI, Wanfang and CQVIP were searched through 21 August 2018, for randomized trials in which at least one comparison was a beta-blocker for the prevention of migraine or tension-type headache in adults. The primary outcome, headache frequency per month, was extracted in duplicate and pooled using random effects models. DATA SYNTHESIS:This study included 108 randomized controlled trials, 50 placebo-controlled and 58 comparative effectiveness trials. Compared to placebo, propranolol reduced episodic migraine headaches by 1.5 headaches/month at 8 weeks (95% CI: -2.3 to -0.65) and was more likely to reduce headaches by 50% (RR: 1.4, 95% CI: 1.1-1.7). Trial Sequential Analysis (TSA) found that these outcomes were unlikely to be due to a Type I error. A network analysis suggested that beta-blocker's benefit for episodic migraines may be a class effect. Trials comparing beta-blockers to other interventions were largely single, underpowered trials. Propranolol was comparable to other medications known to be effective including flunarizine, topiramate and valproate. For chronic migraine, propranolol was more likely to reduce headaches by at least 50% (RR: 2.0, 95% CI: 1.0-4.3). There was only one trial of beta-blockers for tension-type headache. CONCLUSIONS:There is high quality evidence that propranolol is better than placebo for episodic migraine headache. Other comparisons were underpowered, rated as low-quality based on only including single trials, making definitive conclusions about comparative effectiveness impossible. There were few trials examining beta-blocker effectiveness for chronic migraine or tension-type headache though there was limited evidence of benefit. REGISTRATION:Prospero (ID: CRD42017050335).">

        <span class="abst" title="Migraine is a disease that peaks in late adolescence and early adulthood. The aim of this study was to evaluate age-related brain changes in resting state functional connectivity (rs-FC) in migraineurs vs. age-sex matched healthy controls at two developmental stages: adolescence vs. young adulthood. The effect of the disease was assessed within each developmental group and age- and sex-matched healthy controls and between developmental groups (migraine-related age effects). Globally the within group comparisons indicated more widespread abnormal rs-FC in the adolescents than in the young adults and more abnormal rs-FC associated with sensory networks in the young adults. Direct comparison of the two groups showed a number of significant changes: (1) more connectivity changes in the default mode network in the adolescents than in the young adults; (2) stronger rs-FC in the cerebellum network in the adolescents in comparison to young adults; and (3) stronger rs-FC in the executive and sensorimotor network in the young adults. The duration and frequency of the disease were differently associated with baseline intrinsic connectivity in the two groups. fMRI resting state networks demonstrate significant changes in brain function at critical time point of brain development and that potentially different treatment responsivity for the disease may result.">

        <span class="abst" title="BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE:There is an increasing rate of presentations by transient and adult patients (TAPs) to pediatric emergency departments (PED-EDs). TAPs with neurologic diseases (N-TAPs) comprise most of these patients. We investigated this trend and compared the characteristics of N-TAPs with those of pediatric patients with neurologic diseases (N-PEDs) who presented to the PED-ED of a tertiary-care hospital in Korea. METHODS:We reviewed the medical records of neurologic patients who presented to the PED-ED of a single tertiary-care hospital from 2013 to 2017. We included patients with neurologic symptoms or diseases and those who were treated in the pediatric neurology department and underwent neurologic evaluations and treatment in the PED-ED. RESULTS:Presentations by N-TAPs to the PED-ED increased over time, whereas the number of N-PEDs gradually decreased, with a significant difference between the groups (p&lt;0.001). The number of N-TAPs who presented to the PED-ED almost tripled from 2013 to 2017. N-TAPs had significantly more acute symptoms than N-PEDs, and a significantly higher proportion of N-TAPs were insured by Medical Aid compared to N-PEDs (p&lt;0.001). The admission rate was significantly higher (p&lt;0.001) and the mean hospital stay was longer (p=0.046) for N-TAPs. Epilepsy and neurometabolic diseases were mainly responsible for the increased presentations by N-TAPs. CONCLUSIONS:We have clarified the status of N-TAPs in the PED-ER and the role of pediatric neurologists who manage them. Multidisciplinary treatments focusing on the role of pediatric neurologists should be developed to that systematic long-term care plans are applied to N-TAPs.">

According to available data, galcanezumab is safe and efficacious in preventing migraine in episodic migraine patients, also reducing disability and functional impairment due to the disorder. In September 2018, galcanezumab was approved in the USA for the prevention of migraine in adults.

        <span class="abst" title="Pediatric migraine remains still a challenge for the headache specialists as concerns both diagnostic and therapeutic aspects. The less ability of children to describe the exact features of their migraines and the lack of reliable biomarker for migraine contribute to complicate the diagnostic process. Therefore, there's need for new effective tools for supporting diagnostic and therapeutic approach in children with migraine. Recently, promising results have been obtained in adult headache by means of application of neurostimulation techniques both for investigating pathophysiological mechanisms and also for therapeutical applications. Non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) techniques like transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) indeed proved to be generally safe and showing also some evidence of efficacy particularly for the symptomatic treatment. On such basis, in the last years increasing interest is rising in scientific pediatric community to evaluate the potential of such approaches for treatment pediatric headaches, particularly in migraine, even if the evidence provided is still very poor. Here we present a perspective for application of TMS and tDCS technique in children migraine principally based on evidence coming by studies in adults.">

In recent years, SRC has received a significant amount of attention due to potential for long-term neurologic sequelae. However, the acute symptoms and possibility of prolonged recovery account for the vast majority of morbidity from SRC. Modifying factors have been identified and may allow for improved prediction of a protracted course. Potential novel modifying factors may include genetic determinants of recovery, as well as radiographic biomarkers, which represent burgeoning subfields in SRC research. Helmet design and understanding the biomechanical stressors on the brain that lead to concussion also represent active areas of research. This narrative review provides a general synopsis of SRC, including relevant definitions, current treatment paradigms, and modifying factors for recovery, in addition to novel areas of research and future directions for SRC research.">

Despite a broad differential diagnosis for syncope described in the pediatric literature, there has been no report of AVM as the underlying etiology. We present a case of a seven-year-old female who presented with a single syncopal episode and was later found to have a large AVM involving mainly the thalamus on the right side and the basal ganglia with large intraventricular draining veins into the galenic venous system.

Methods:The first part of the study is a retrospective single-center cohort study. The diagnostic work-ups of eight pediatricians were compared to the national guidelines. Intra- and inter-observer variability were examined by Cramer's V test. Intra-observer variability was defined as the amount of variation within a pediatrician and inter-observer variability as the amount of variation between pediatricians in the application of diagnostic work-up in children with RAP. Prospectively, the same pediatricians were requested to provide a report on their management strategy with a fictitious case to prove similarities in retrospective diagnostic work-up. Results:A total of 10 patients per pediatrician were analyzed. Retrospectively, a (very) weak association between pediatricians' diagnostic work-ups was found (0.22), which implies high inter-observer variability. The association between intra-observer diagnostic was moderate (range, 0.35-0.46). The Cramer's V of 0.60 in diagnostic work-up between pediatricians in the fictitious case implied the presence of a moderately strong association and lower inter-observer variability than in the retrospective study. Adherence to the guideline was 66.8%. Conclusion:We found a high intra- and inter-observer variability and moderate guideline adherence in daily clinical practice amongst pediatricians in treating children with RAP in a teaching hospital.">

        <span class="abst" title="BACKGROUND:Headache is one of the most common complaints among pediatric patients and can be due to many causes, some benign but others potentially seriously. Increased intracranial pressure, which is known to cause papilledema, is a serious cause of headache, and immediate diagnosis is critical, although difficult. The current study evaluates the diagnostic value of optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) and eyeball transverse diameter (ETD) ratio in pediatric patients presenting with headache and papilledema. METHODS:A retrospective analysis of all pediatric patients undergoing head computed tomography scans between January 2013 and December 2015. Patients with normal brain scans were included in the study. Patients presenting with headache underwent funduscopic evaluation and grouped as either headache with papilledema or headache without papilledema. A control group of patients without headache was also included. Studies were reviewed blindly by a neuroradiologist and ONSD and ETD for both eyes were measured. RESULTS:ONSD/ETD index was found to have significantly higher values (p&lt;0.001) in patients with papilledema (median 0.24, interquartile range (IQR) = 0.22-0.25) compared to patients without papilledema (median 0.18, IQR = 0.16-0.19) and the control group (median 0.17, IQR = 0.15-0.18). The ONSD/ETD index showed excellent discrimination ability for patients with headache and papilledema (AUC = 0.96, 95% CI, 0.94-0.99). The ONSD/ETD index of 0.21 was found to have a sensitivity and specificity of 82% and 93%, respectively, for identifying pediatric patients with headache and papilledema. CONCLUSION:Our study shows that ONSD/ETD index of 0.21 can be used as an easy-to-use reference tool for diagnosing papilledema and elevated intracranial pressure in pediatric patients.">

        <span class="abst" title="An increasing amount of evidence suggests that migraines are a response to a cerebral energy deficiency or oxidative stress levels that exceed antioxidant capacity. The ketogenic diet (KD), a diet mimicking fasting that leads to the elevation of ketone bodies (KBs), is a therapeutic intervention targeting cerebral metabolism that has recently shown great promise in the prevention of migraines. KBs are an alternative fuel source for the brain, and are thus likely able to circumvent some of the abnormalities in glucose metabolism and transport found in migraines. Recent research has shown that KBs-D-β-hydroxybutyrate in particular-are more than metabolites. As signalling molecules, they have the potential to positively influence other pathways commonly believed to be part of migraine pathophysiology, namely: mitochondrial functioning, oxidative stress, cerebral excitability, inflammation and the gut microbiome. This review will describe the mechanisms by which the presence of KBs, D-BHB in particular, could influence those migraine pathophysiological mechanisms. To this end, common abnormalities in migraines are summarised with a particular focus on clinical data, including phenotypic, biochemical, genetic and therapeutic studies. Experimental animal data will be discussed to elaborate on the potential therapeutic mechanisms of elevated KBs in migraine pathophysiology, with a particular focus on the actions of D-BHB. In complex diseases such as migraines, a therapy that can target multiple possible pathogenic pathways seems advantageous. Further research is needed to establish whether the absence/restriction of dietary carbohydrates, the presence of KBs, or both, are of primary importance for the migraine protective effects of the KD.">

There are several possible migraine triggers in a patient's environment, which should be avoided where possible. The objective of this Austrian monocentric study was to identify migraine triggers and the areas, in which children and adolescents with migraine have a lower quality of life than healthy, headache-free children. METHODS:In this cross-sectional, questionnaire study, 76 children from ages 8 to 17 years were included. Thirty-seven were classified as migraineurs, 39 as non-migraineurs. Participants filled in a questionnaire surveying the areas of physical, socio-economic and school functioning. Migraineurs further answered migraine-specific questions. RESULTS:The study included 33 (43.4%) males and 43 (56.6%) females. Median age was 13.00 (10.00-16.00) years. Average age of onset for migraine was 9.22 ± 3.34 years. Non-migraineurs skipped trendwise fewer meals (p.adjust = 0.108) and exercised more often (p.adjust = 0.108). In socio-economic functioning, the father's nationality being Austrian might be related to migraine (p.adjust = 0.108). Children with migraine had a significantly lower quality of life in school functioning (PedsQL 4.0 questionnaire, p.adjust = 0.04) and had significantly less often &quot;good&quot; grades than children without migraine (p.adjust = 0.048). CONCLUSION:Children with migraine show a reduced quality of life in the areas of physical, socio-economic and school functioning.">

        <span class="abst" title="Introduction Chronic migraine is particularly devastating. It affects school work, extracurricular activities, and quality of life, including relationships with other family members, and can also influence the mental health of both the migraineurs and family members. According to the International Classification of Headache Disorders, 3rd edition (ICHD-3), chronic migraine is defined as 15 or more headache days per month for greater than three months, where at least on eight days per month, there are features of migraine headache. Although botulinum toxin type A (BoNTA) has been proven effective for treating chronic migraine in adults, little literature exists about its use in children. Here, we present the treatment response in children with chronic migraines treated with BoNTA at our institutions Duke and State University of New York (SUNY) Upstate. Method A retrospective analysis of 30 adolescent migraineurs who met ICHD-3 criteria for chronic migraine were treated with BoNTA injection according to the standardized adult protocol. Descriptive statistics and paired t-tests were performed. A total of 185 units of botulinum toxin were injected intramuscularly per patient, as in addition to the standard 31 sites for a total of 155 units, an additional 30 units were given in areas that were felt to provide further benefit. Results Participants (n=30) were 16.5 ± 1.83 years old. The headaches were precipitated by trauma in seven cases. All had failed standard pharmacotherapy, including amitriptyline and topiramate. An average of 2.47 ± 1.6 BoNTA injection cycles was performed. Migraine severity decreased significantly from 7.47 ± 1.89 on a 10-point scale to 4.34 ± 3.02 (p&lt;.001). Additionally, headache frequency improved from 24.4 ± 7.49 painful days per month to 14.8 ± 12.52 painful days per month (p&lt;.001). One patient developed nausea related to injections; all others tolerated it well, with no side effects. Discussion BoNTA injection was a safe and effective therapy for chronic migraine in our cohort of children recalcitrant to medical therapy. Further research with multi-centered, double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled trials is warranted to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy in this population.">

        <span class="abst" title="Introduction: Headaches are common among children and about 80% of children reporting them. Migraine and tension type headaches are the most common primary headaches in children and the prevalence of migraine is about 8%. Accompanying sensory symptoms are common before, during and after migraine attacks. They may be a part of a wider symptom constellation called sensory processing disorder or difficulties (SPD). This includes both hyper or hypo sensitivity to sensations. However, the literature regarding sensory processing symptoms of children and youth with headaches as well as its interaction with child's emotional aspects and quality of life is scarce. Materials and Methods: One hundred and thirty-four children between the ages of 8 and 12 participated in this study. Fifty-four children (22 boys and 32 girls) with episodic migraine were prospectively recruited from pediatric neurological clinics during the years 2014-2017. The control group included 80 healthy children. Both groups completed a health and demographic questionnaire, headache assessment including Ped-MIDAS, Short Sensory Profile, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) for children, and the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory. Results: Children with migraine showed significantly higher prevalence of sensory processing difficulties and lower quality of life compared to healthy controls. Among children with migraine, sensory processing difficulties significantly correlated with lower quality of life. Headache-related disability and sensory processing difficulties predicted quality of life. Conclusion: The possible relationship between migraine and sensory processing disorder or difficulties stresses the need to screen for sensory processing difficulties among children with migraine and when found-refer to their impacts on children's daily function and quality of life.">

        <span class="abst" title="Vestibular Migraine (VM) and Meniere's Disease (MD) are episodic vestibular syndromes defined by a set of associated symptoms such as tinnitus, hearing loss or migraine features during the attacks. Both conditions may show symptom overlap and there is no biological marker to distinguish them. Two subgroups of MD patients have been reported, according to their IL-1β profile. Therefore, considering the clinical similarity between VM and MD, we aimed to investigate the cytokine profile of MD and VM as a means to distinguish these patients. We have also carried out gene expression microarrays and measured the levels of 14 cytokines and 11 chemokines in 129 MD patients, 82 VM patients, and 66 healthy controls. Gene expression profile in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) showed significant differences in MD patients with high and low basal levels of IL- 1β and VM patients. MD patients with high basal levels of IL- 1β (MDH) had overall higher levels of cytokines/chemokines when compared to the other subsets. CCL4 levels were significantly different between MDH, MD with low basal levels of IL- 1β (MDL), VM and controls. Logistic regression identified IL- 1β, CCL3, CCL22, and CXCL1 levels as capable of differentiating VM patients from MD patients (area under the curve = 0.995), suggesting a high diagnostic value in patients with symptoms overlap.">

Methods:This cross sectional study was conducted at CMH Gujranwala from March 2018 to November 2018.A total of 262 children, aged from 5 to 16 years, with 2 to 8 weeks history of persistent headache underwent detailed ophthalmic assessment for refractive errors, and other ophthalmic evaluation. Children with ametropia, confirmed with cycloplegic refraction and post-mydriatic testing were prescribed with glasses. Patients without any ophthalmic findings were referred back to pediatrics department for further evaluation. Results:Mean age of study population was 8.97 ± 3.16 years. Mean duration of headache was 5.03 ± 1.81 weeks. Ametropia was found in 56 (21.4%) children, while 206 (78.6%) had no refractive error. Out of children with ametropia, 20 (35.7%) had myopia, 24 (42.8%) had astigmatism and 12 (21.5%) had hypermetropia. There was no difference in ametropic children and children without ametropia with respect to gender (p=0.73), age (p=0.54) and duration of headache (p=0.71). Conclusion:A significant proportion of children with ametropia have initial symptoms of headache. Any child with un-explained headache must undergo ophthalmic evaluation to diagnose refractive error, if any.">

Post hoc analyses of two phase 3 randomized, vehicle-controlled, 4-week trials (ATMOS-1 [NCT02530281] and ATMOS-2 [NCT02530294]) were performed to assess efficacy and safety of topical anticholinergic glycopyrronium tosylate (GT) in pediatric patients. METHODS:Patients had primary axillary hyperhidrosis ≥ 6 months, average Axillary Sweating Daily Diary (ASDD/ASDD-Children [ASDD-C]) Item 2 (sweating severity) score ≥ 4, sweat production ≥ 50 mg/5 min (each axilla), and Hyperhidrosis Disease Severity Scale (HDSS) ≥ 3. Coprimary end points were ≥ 4-point improvement on ASDD/ASDD-C Item 2 (a validated patient-reported outcome) and change in gravimetrically measured sweat production at Week 4. Efficacy and safety data are shown through Week 4 for the pediatric (≥ 9 to ≤ 16 years) vs older (&gt; 16 years) subgroups. RESULTS:Six hundred and ninety-seven patients were randomized in ATMOS-1/ATMOS-2 (GT, N = 463; vehicle, N = 234); 44 were ≥ 9 to ≤ 16 years (GT, n = 25; vehicle, n = 19). Baseline disease characteristics were generally similar across subgroups. GT-treated pediatric vs older patients had comparable improvements in ASDD/ASDD-C Item 2 (sweating severity) responder rate, HDSS responder rate (≥ 2-grade improvement]), sweat production, and quality of life (mean change from Baseline in Dermatology Life Quality Index [DLQI]/children's DLQI), with greater improvement vs vehicle. Treatment-emergent adverse events were similar between subgroups, and most were mild, transient, and infrequently led to discontinuation. CONCLUSIONS:Topical, once-daily GT improved disease severity (ASDD/ASDD-C, HDSS), sweat production, and quality of life (DLQI), with similar findings in children, adults, and the pooled population. GT was well tolerated, and treatment-emergent adverse events were qualitatively similar between subgroups and consistent with other anticholinergics.">

Migraine and tension-type headache (TTH) are the most common primary headache forms among pediatric population. Several studies have investigated the incidence of infant colic in patients with migraine and TTH. The meta-analysis was to assess the relationship between infant colic and migraine as well as TTH. Methods:PubMed, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library were searched until August 16, 2018, for potential studies. Data were extracted by two independent authors and analyzed using RevMan 5.2 software. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to determine the association between infant colic and migraine as well as TTH, respectively. Results:A total of 148 studies were found, and 7 studies were finally included. A higher incidence of colic during infancy was revealed in migraine patients than controls (P=0.05, OR: 2.51, 95% CI: 1.32-4.77) and TTH subjects (P=0.02, OR: 0.33, 95% CI: 0.13-0.86), respectively. And no significances were found between TTHs with controls (P=0.51, OR: 1.17, 95% CI: 0.73-1.89). Conclusion:This meta-analysis indicated that migraine was associated with increased incidence of infantile colic history, but TTH incidence was not relevant with the incidence of infantile colic history.">

The aim of this study was to investigate the frequency of these symptoms in migraine and to compare the clinical characteristics of patients with and without these symptoms. Frequency of the patients that exposed to the additional investigations was searched. Materials and Methods:In this prospective study between February 2016 and March 2017, 170 pediatric patients who were referred to our tertiary teaching hospital with migraine were enrolled. Results:A total of 170 children, 61 male (35.9%) and 109 female (64.1%) were included in the study. CASs were present in 68 patients (40%), single symptom in 31 (45.6%), and multiple symptoms in 37 (54.4%) patients. Of 68 patients with CAS, 24 (35%) patients were referred to allergists and all were tested for inhaler specific IgE and skin tests. Seventy (32.9%) patients had neck pain/stiffness in which 28 (40%) were exposed to radiation. CAS and neck pain were more frequent in patients with frequent attacks (P = 0.04 and P = 0.032, respectively). Neck pain was more frequent in patients with CAS (P = 0.029). Conclusions:It is important for pediatricians and primary care physicians to be aware of the common nature of CASs and neck pain/stiffness in children with migraine to prevent unnecessary procedures. High frequency of migrain attacks was associated with high frequency of CAS and neck pain.">

        <span class="abst" title="BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE:The susceptibility-weighted imaging form of brain MRI using minimum intensity projection (mIP) is useful for assessing traumatic brain injuries because it readily reveals deoxyhemoglobin or paramagnetic compounds. We investigated the efficacy of using this methodology in nontraumatic patients. METHODS:We retrospectively analyzed the asymmetric mIP findings in nontraumatic patients. Asymmetric mIP images were first verified visually and then using ImageJ software. We enrolled patients with a difference of &gt;5% between hemispheres in ImageJ analysis. All patients underwent detailed history-taking and EEG, and asymmetric mIP findings were compared. RESULTS:The visual analysis identified 54 pediatric patients (37 males and 17 females) with asymmetric mIP findings. Ten patients were excluded because they did not meet the ImageJ verification criteria. The 44 patients with asymmetry comprised 36 with epilepsy, 6 with headache, and 2 with cerebral infarction. Thirty-one of the 36 epileptic patients showed definite partial seizure activities in semiology, while the remaining patients did not demonstrate a history of partial seizure manifestations. The MRI findings were normal in all patients except for five with periventricular leukomalacia unrelated to seizure symptoms. There was agreement between mIP images and semiology in 29 (93.5%) of the 31 epileptic patients with focal signs, while the other 2 demonstrated discordance. Twenty (64.5%) of the 31 patients showed consistent EEG abnormalities. CONCLUSIONS:Our data suggest that asymmetric mIP findings are an excellent lateralizing indicator in pediatric patients with partial epilepsy.">

The aim of this study was to investigate healthcare experiences in children with HAE due to C1 inhibitor deficiency (C1-INH-HAE) in Croatia in order to estimate the number of affected children and to recommend management protocols for diagnosis, short-term prophylaxis and acute treatment. Patients were recruited during a 4-year period at five hospitals in Croatia. Complement testing was performed in patients with a positive family history. This pilot study revealed nine pediatric patients positive for C1-INH- HAE type I, aged 1-16 years, four of them asymptomatic. Before the age of one year, C1-INH levels may be lower than in adults; it is advisable to confirm C1-INH-HAE after the age of one year. Plasma-derived C1-INH is recommended as acute and short-term prophylactic treatment. Recombinant C1-INH and icatibant are licensed for the acute treatment of pediatric patients.

Attacks can last many hours or days, and consist of multiple symptoms including headache, nausea, vomiting, hypersensitivity to stimuli such as light and sound, and in some cases, an aura is present. Mechanisms contributing to migraine are still poorly understood. However, transient receptor potential (TRP) channels have been repeatedly linked to the disorder, including TRPV1, TRPV4, TRPM8, and TRPA1, based on their activation by pathological stimuli related to attacks, or their modulation by drugs/natural products known to be efficacious for migraine. This review will provide a brief overview of migraine, including current therapeutics and the link to calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), a neuropeptide strongly implicated in migraine pathophysiology. Discussion will then focus on recent developments in preclinical and clinical studies that implicate TRP channels in migraine pathophysiology or in the efficacy of therapeutics. Given the use of onabotulinum toxin A (BoNTA) to treat chronic migraine, and its poorly understood mechanism, this review will also cover possible contributions of TRP channels to BoNTA efficacy. Discussion will conclude with remaining questions that require future work to more fully evaluate TRP channels as novel therapeutic targets for migraine.">

Methods: We describe two female patients with LWD. Their prime clinical complaints were severe bouts of migraine and antalgic gait. Results: Interestingly, via a 3D reconstruction CT scan we encountered several major anomalies. Notable features of craniosynostosis through premature fusion of the squamosal sutures and partial closure of the coronal sutures were the reason behind the development of abnormal craniofacial contour. A 3D reconstruction CT scan showed apparent bulging of the clavarium through the partially synostosed coronal and totally synostosed squamosal sutures. Additional deformities include deficient number of ribs (10 ribs on both sides), defective ossification of the ischium and dysplasia of the iliac-ischial junction, and coxa valga have been noted. Conclusions: The constellation of observed deformities can be considered as a novel features associated with LWD.">

        <span class="abst" title="PURPOSE OF REVIEW:Imaging constitutes one of the key pillars in the diagnostic workup after a first seizure as well as for the presurgical workup in epilepsy. The role of imaging in emergency situations, mainly to support the adequate diagnosis, as well as its role in planning of noninvasive image-guided therapies is less well established. Here, we provide an overview on peri-ictal imaging findings to support differential diagnosis in emergency situations and describe recent attempts toward minimal invasive therapy in the treatment of epilepsy and its comorbidities based on a combination of imaging techniques with ultrasound. RECENT FINDINGS:Peri-ictal perfusion changes can differentiate ictal stroke mimics from acute ischemic stroke if focal areas of increased perfusion are depicted by computed tomography or MRI. Postictal perfusion patterns in patients with persisting neurological symptoms are frequently normal and do not reach enough diagnostic sensitivity to differentiate between stroke and its mimics. Noninvasive magnetic resonance-techniques as arterial spin labeling may provide a higher sensitivity, especially in combination with diffusion-weighted and susceptibility-weighted MRI. Imaging guided focused ultrasound (FUS) bears the potential to ablate epileptogenic tissue and allows suppression of epileptic activity. Imaging guided blood-brain-barrier opening with FUS offers new options for local drug administration. SUMMARY:MRI should be considered the method of choice in the differential diagnosis of peri-ictal imaging findings and their differential diagnosis. A combination of various MRI techniques with FUS opens new avenues for treatment of epilepsy.">

The rat model group was divided into an untreated control group (n=9), a group pretreated with naproxen alone (2.8 mg/kg) (n=9), a group pretreated with naproxen (2.8 mg/kg) combined with curcumin solution (1 mg/0.1 kg) (n=9), a group pretreated with naproxen (2.8 mg/kg) combined with curcumin solution (2 mg/0.1 kg) (n=9), a group pretreated with naproxen (2.8 mg/kg) combined with liposomal curcumin solution (1 mg/0.1 kg) (n=9) a group pretreated with naproxen (2.8 mg/kg) combined with liposomal curcumin solution (2 mg/0.1 kg) (n=9). Spectroscopy measured biomarkers of total oxidative status and nociception was tested using an injection of 1% of formalin into the rat paw. RESULTS Expression of biomarkers of oxidative stress and enhanced nociception were significantly increased following pretreatment with combined naproxen and liposomal curcumin compared with curcumin solution or naproxen alone (P&lt;0.001). Combined curcumin solution and naproxen were more effective at a concentration of 2 mg/0.1kg for the first nociceptive phase (P&lt;0.005).

Given that the recently introduced calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) inhibitors (CGRP-r) are still limited to adulthood, there is no drug with exclusive indication for migraine treatment in pediatric age. This raises several limitations in terms of adherence and effectiveness of the therapy. Moreover, the scenario is complicated by placebo response, which is larger in children and adolescents than in adults and often leads to an improvement in the attack frequency even in absence of any active pharmacological treatment.

        <span class="abst" title="Purpose: Repetitive peripheral magnetic stimulation (rPMS) has been successfully applied recently in migraineurs to alleviate migraine symptoms. Symptom relief has been achieved by stimulating myofascial trigger points (mTrPs) of the trapezius muscles, which are considered part of the trigemino-cervical complex (TCC). However, effects on musculature have not been assessed in detail, and the specificity of effects to muscles considered part of the TCC yet has to be elucidated. Against this background, this study presents the setup of rPMS in migraine and evaluates effects on skeletal musculature. Materials and Methods: Thirty-seven adults (mean age: 25.0 ± 4.1 years, 36 females) suffering from migraine and presenting mTrPs according to physical examination underwent rPMS either to mTrPs in the trapezius muscles (considered part of the TCC; n = 19) or deltoid muscles (considered not part of the TCC; n = 18) during six sessions over the course of 2 weeks. Standardized questionnaires were filled in to assess any adverse events and experience with rPMS as well as satisfaction and benefits from stimulation. Algometry was performed to evaluate changes in pressure pain thresholds (PPTs). Results: All stimulation sessions were successfully performed without adverse events, with 84.2% of subjects of the trapezius group and 94.4% of subjects of the deltoid group describing rPMS as comfortable (p = 0.736). Muscular pain or tension improved in 73.7% of subjects of the trapezius group and in 61.1% of subjects of the deltoid group (p = 0.077). PPTs of the trapezius muscles clearly increased from the first to the last stimulation sessions-regardless of the stimulated muscle (rPMS to the trapezius or deltoid muscles). However, depending on the examined muscles the increase of PPTs differed significantly (subjects with stimulation of trapezius muscles: p = 0.021; subjects with stimulation of deltoid muscles: p = 0.080). Conclusion: rPMS is a comfortable method in migraineurs that can improve local muscular pain or tension. Furthermore, it is able to increase directly and indirectly the PPTs of the trapezius muscles (considered part of the TCC) when applied over mTrPs, supporting the role of the TCC in migraineurs.">

        <span class="abst" title="Background: Some studies have demonstrated the high impact of headache and migraine in several areas of children and adolescents' life. In recent years, there has been an increase in scientific interest in the relationship between migraine and emotional regulation, investigating the possible consequences of emotional dysregulation on physical and mental health. While some studies have been carried out on the relationship between alexithymia and headache or migraine (especially in adults), no data exist on relationship between Theory of Mind (TOM), metacognition, and alexithymia in children and adolescents with migraine. Methods: Children with diagnosis of migraine without aura (MWoA) (36 males and 34 females) were compared to a healthy control group (31 males and 39 females). The age range was from 8 to 13 years in both groups. All children completed the Alexithymia Questionnaire for Children (AQC) for the assessment of alexithymia levels and the Domain of Social Perception included in the NEPSY-II to evaluate levels of TOM. Metacognitive development was evaluated with Io e La Mia Mente for children aged between 8 and 10 years and with Metacognitions Questionnaire for Children (MCQ-C) for children from 11 to 13. Results: There were no differences between children with MWoA and the control group in metacognitive abilities; only in the subscale &quot;Negative Meta Worrying&quot; of MCQ-C girls scored higher than boys, regardless of the group they were part of. Also, in the NEPSY-II subscale there were no statistically significant differences between the two groups. Children with MWoA scored higher in the AQC subscales &quot;Difficulty Identifying Feelings&quot; and &quot;Difficulty Describing Feelings&quot; than controls. Moreover, children between 8 and 10 years statistically differed from older children in &quot;Difficulty Identifying Feelings&quot; and in Total Score. Conclusion: Our data suggest that children with MWoA have no metacognitive and TOM problems compared to a healthy group. The experimental group showed higher traits of alexithymia, confirming what suggested by other studies in the literature. Future research will have to focus on migraine with aura and tension-type headache to evaluate any differences with children with MWoA.">

Epigenetic regulation of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is a matter of debate and there are some conflicting results, especially on mtDNA methylation. Micro RNAs (miRNAs) and long-noncoding RNA (lncRNAs) have been detected in mitochondria. The regulation of the miRNA-lncRNA axis can be important for mitochondrial physiology and its impairment can result in a disease phenotype.

        <span class="abst" title="Sensory modulation disorder (SMD) affects sensory processing across single or multiple sensory systems. The sensory over-responsivity (SOR) subtype of SMD is manifested clinically as a condition in which non-painful stimuli are perceived as abnormally irritating, unpleasant, or even painful. Moreover, SOR interferes with participation in daily routines and activities (Dunn, 2007; Bar-Shalita et al., 2008; Chien et al., 2016), co-occurs with daily pain hyper-sensitivity, and reduces quality of life due to bodily pain. Laboratory behavioral studies have confirmed abnormal pain perception, as demonstrated by hyperalgesia and an enhanced lingering painful sensation, in children and adults with SMD. Advanced quantitative sensory testing (QST) has revealed the mechanisms of altered pain processing in SOR whereby despite the existence of normal peripheral sensory processing, there is enhanced facilitation of pain-transmitting pathways along with preserved but delayed inhibitory pain modulation. These findings point to central nervous system (CNS) involvement as the underlying mechanism of pain hypersensitivity in SOR. Based on the mutual central processing of both non-painful and painful sensory stimuli, we suggest shared mechanisms such as cortical hyper-excitation, an excitatory-inhibitory neuronal imbalance, and sensory modulation alterations. This is supported by novel findings indicating that SOR is a risk factor and comorbidity of chronic non-neuropathic pain disorders. This is the first review to summarize current empirical knowledge investigating SMD and pain, a sensory modality not yet part of the official SMD realm. We propose a neurophysiological mechanism-based model for the interrelation between pain and SMD. Embracing the pain domain could significantly contribute to the understanding of this condition's pathogenesis and how it manifests in daily life, as well as suggesting the basis for future potential mechanism-based therapies.">

The diagnostic criteria for ictal epileptic headache (IEH) suggested in 2012 were quite restrictive thus leading to the underestimation of this phenomenon. However, these criteria have not yet been included into the ICHD-3 revision published in 2018, thus creating confusion among both, physicians and experts in this field. Here, we highlight the importance to strictly apply the original IEH criteria explaining the reasons through the analysis of the clinical, historical, epidemiological and pathophysiological characteristics of the IEH itself.

Around 30% of patients also report aura symptoms. The cause of the aura is believed to be related to the cortical spreading depression (CSD), a wave of neuronal and glial depolarization originating in the occipital cortex, followed by temporary neuronal silencing. During a migraine attack, increased expression of inflammatory mediators, along with a decrease in the expression of anti-inflammatory genes, have been observed. The aim of this study was to evaluate the expression of inflammatory genes, in particular that of IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RN), following CSD in a mouse model of familial hemiplegic migraine type 1 (FHM-1). We show here that the expression of IL-1RN was upregulated after the CSD, suggesting a possible attempt to modulate the inflammatory response. This study allows researchers to better understand the development of the disease and aids in the search for new therapeutic strategies in migraine.">

The aim of this study was to investigate whether pediatric migraine is associated with vitamin D deficiency and the effect of vitamin D therapy on the frequency, duration, severity of migraine attacks, and Pediatric Migraine Disability Assessment (PedMIDAS). MATERIALS AND METHODS:We retrospectively examined the patients' levels of calcium, phosphorus, parathyroid hormone, alkaline phosphatase, and 25-OH vitamin D of 92 pediatric migraine patients. The patients were divided into two groups: Group 1, which had low vitamin D levels and received vitamin D therapy, and group 2, which had normal vitamin D levels and did not receive vitamin D therapy. Migraine severity measured by the visual analog scale (VAS), migraine frequency, and duration as well as scores on the PedMIDAS questionnaire were compared with regard to the 25-OH vitamin D levels. In addition, pre- and posttreatment pedMIDAS scores, VAS, migraine frequency, and duration were compared with baseline values. RESULTS:A total of 34.7% patients had vitamin D insufficiency (vitamin D levels between 10 and 20 ng/mL), whereas 10.8% had vitamin D deficiency (vitamin D levels &lt; 10 ng/mL). Migraine frequency, migraine duration, and PedMIDAS scores were significantly higher in the group 1 than group 2 (p = 0.004, p = 0.008, and p = 0.001). After vitamin D therapy at sixth months of supplementation, migraine duration was reported statistically significant shorter (p &lt; 0.001) and the migraine frequency, VAS scores, and pedMIDAS scores were statistically significant lower compared with baseline values in group 1 (p &lt; 0.001). CONCLUSION:We found a marked correlation between pediatric migraine and vitamin D levels. Vitamin D therapy was beneficial in migraine pediatric patients.">

Methods: A cross-sectional community-based study included Kuwaiti population aged 6-17 years. They were randomly recruited from all six governorates of Kuwait using stratified multistage cluster sampling. The Headache-Attributed Restriction, Disability, and Social Handicap and Impaired Participation (HARDSHIP) questionnaire for children and adolescents was used to collect the data. Results: Data were collected from 3,423 subjects; 664 subjects were diagnosed as having primary headache disorders. The mean age was 12.61 ± 2.51 years and 64.2% were females. One year prevalence of headache was 19.4%. It was significantly prevalent in females compared to males (25.2% vs. 13.8%; P &lt; 0.001). Primary headache disorder significantly increased in age group 12-17 when compared to age group 6-11 years (25.8% vs. 10.4 %; p &lt; 0.001). One year primary headache prevalence showed non-significant differences in both males and females in age group 6-11 years (10.1% in males vs. 10.6% in females; P &lt; 0.79), while it was significantly higher in female vs. males (38.1% vs. 15.8%; P &lt; 0.001) in age group 12-17 years. Migraine prevalence was 10.9% followed by tension type headache (TTH) 6.2% and chronic headache 0.9%. Medical care utilization was reported in 67% of our cohort. The majority (95%) of the patients received symptomatic drugs for headache attacks and only 7.5% used preventive medication. The students with headache lost a mean of 1.29 ± 1.23 days of school, reported mean of 1.16 ± 1.50 days they could not do activities they had wanted to. Their parents lost a mean of 1.01 ± 1.02 days of work because of headaches of their children during the preceding 4 weeks of the study. Conclusions: The estimated 1 year prevalence of headache was 19.4% overall. Primary headache prevalence increased with age and it was more prevalent in female adolescents compared to males of the same age. Headache disorders in children/adolescents affect school and social activities as well as their parents work. The awareness for early diagnosis and preventive medications for headache in this age group may reduce the headache burden.">

Despite national efforts to harmonize the recognition and management of pediatric concussion in Canada, timely access to primary and specialized care following this injury remains a challenge for many patients especially those who live in rural and remote communities. To address similar challenges facing patients with stroke and other neurological disorders, physicians have begun to leverage advances in telemedicine to improve the delivery of specialized neurological care to those living in medically underserved regions. Preliminary studies suggest that telemedicine may be a safe and cost-effective approach to assist in the medical care of select patients with acute concussion and persistent post-concussion symptoms. Here we provide an overview of telemedicine, teleneurology, the principles of concussion assessment and management, as well as the current state of concussion care in Canada. Utilizing preliminary evidence from studies of telemedicine in concussion and experience from comprehensive systems of care for stroke, we outline steps that must be taken to evaluate the potential of telemedicine-based concussion networks to improve the care of pediatric concussion patients living in underserved rural and remote communities in Canada.">

        <span class="abst" title="Importance:Telemedicine is increasingly used to provide outpatient pediatric neurology consultations in underserved communities. Although telemedicine clinics have been shown to improve access, little is known about how they alter patients' utilization of hospital services. Objective:To evaluate the association between access to telemedicine clinics and hospital utilization among underserved children with neurologic conditions. Design, Setting, and Participants:This retrospective cross-sectional study included 4169 patients who received outpatient care from pediatric neurologists affiliated with an academic children's hospital in California between January 1, 2009, and July 31, 2017, either in person or using telemedicine. Exposures:Consultation modality (telemedicine or in person) in the outpatient neurology clinics. Main Outcomes and Measures:Demographic and clinical variables were abstracted from the hospital's electronic medical records. The association between the modality of outpatient neurology care and patients' utilization of the emergency department and hospitalizations was evaluated. Both all-cause and neurologic condition-related hospital utilization were analyzed using multivariable negative binomial regression in overall and matched samples. Results:The telemedicine cohort comprised 378 patients (211 [55.8%] male), and the in-person cohort comprised 3791 patients (2090 [55.1%] male). The mean (SD) age at the first encounter was 7.4 (5.4) years for the telemedicine cohort and 7.8 (5.1) years for the in-person cohort. The telemedicine cohort was more likely than the in-person cohort to have nonprivate insurance (public insurance, self-pay, or uninsured), lower education, and lower household income. The rates of all-cause and neurologic hospital encounters were lower among children who received pediatric neurology consultations over telemedicine compared with children who received care in the in-person clinics (5.7 [95% CI, 3.5-8.0] vs 20.1 [95% CI, 18.1-22.1] per 100 patient-years and 3.7 [95% CI, 2.0-5.3] vs 8.9 [95% CI, 7.8-10.0] per 100 patient-years, respectively; P &lt; .001). Even after adjusting for demographic and clinical factors, the telemedicine cohort had a lower risk of hospital encounters (emergency department visits and admissions) with an adjusted incidence rate ratio of 0.57 (95% CI, 0.38-0.88) for all-cause encounters and an adjusted incidence rate ratio of 0.60 (95% CI, 0.36-0.99) for neurologic encounters. After matching on travel time to the neurology clinic, the adjusted incidence rate ratio was 0.19 (95% CI, 0.04-0.83) for all-cause admissions and 0.14 (95% CI, 0.02-0.82) for neurologic admissions. Conclusions and Relevance:Pediatric neurology care through real-time, audiovisual telemedicine consultations was associated with lower hospital utilization compared with in-person consultations, suggesting that high-cost hospital encounters can be prevented by improving subspecialty access.">

        <span class="abst" title="Background:Headache is one of the most common pain symptoms in childhood having a negative impact on many aspects of the lives of affected children, both short-term and long-term. Therefore, it is important to document safe and effective treatment options. Chiropractic spinal manipulation is a commonly used treatment option for these patients, although there are no randomized clinical trials documenting the effectiveness of this in pediatric headache. However, there is moderate evidence for effectiveness of spinal manipulation for adults with tension-type and cervicogenic headaches.This paper describes the protocol for a two-armed randomized superiority clinical trial aiming to investigate the effectiveness of chiropractic manipulation versus sham manipulation in the treatment of recurrent headache in children aged 7-14. Methods:Children with weekly headaches for at least six months will be included if they have indications for chiropractic manipulation. The participants will be randomized to either chiropractic manipulation or sham manipulation. Both children and parents will be blinded for allocation. There will be 100 children in each arm and they will answer weekly text messages four weeks prior to treatment and during a four months treatment period. Potential primary outcomes are weekly number of headaches, intensity of headache, medication use and global perceived effect. Secondary outcomes include side-effects and headache status after one year.An initial outcome data analysis will be performed to inform the choice of primary outcome (adaptive design). Intervention effects will be reported as the difference in mean values between the two treatment arms, Cohen's effect size and numbers needed to treat. Discussion:A major strength of this study is its pragmatic nature, where the active treatment group receives chiropractic manipulation according to their individual needs, while both groups continue their use of medication for headache according to their pre-trial habits. Other strengths include an elaborate sham procedure and the weekly outcome reports, reducing recall bias.If it is possible to develop effective treatment for headache in children, a life course of recurring problems may be altered with potential positive implications for both individuals and society.

        <span class="abst" title="Tadpole pupil is a rare phenomenon in which segmental spasm of the iris dilator muscle results in a tadpole-shaped pupil. The pupillary distortion is usually unilateral, lasts several minutes, and can recur in clusters. Any segment of the iris can be affected; thus, for some patients, a different-shaped tadpole pupil is noticed from episode to episode. Tadpole pupil most commonly appears spontaneously in young women. Tadpole pupil is not associated with any systemic disorders, but an ipsilateral Horner syndrome is noted in 46% of patients. In this article, we have reviewed the existing literature of tadpole pupil, compiling all the published cases in a table and reporting four additional cases to re-examine the clinical profile of this disorder and to consider the different purported mechanisms as means to understand its possible etiology and treatment. The common denominator in the pathophysiology of tadpole pupil is a focal excessive contraction (segmental spasm) of the iris dilator muscle. Based on various proposed pathophysiologic mechanism of tadpole pupil, we can consider potential forms of treatment.">

        <span class="abst" title="Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is a major player in migraine pathophysiology, and CGRP monoclonal antibodies including fremanezumab may be a safe effective preventive therapy. Phase IIb studies in episodic migraine (EM) and chronic migraine (CM) demonstrated efficacy at both the monthly 225 mg and quarterly 675 mg doses. The Phase III trials for EM and CM both showed a reduction in the primary endpoint of monthly migraine days (MMD). In the EM trial, the baseline MMD of 8.9 days was reduced to 5.3 at 12 weeks and to 4.0 days in the 6-month open-label extension (OLE) for monthly dosing. In the quarterly dosing, the baseline was 9.2 days reduced to 5.3 at 12 weeks and to 4.2 days in the OLE. In the CM data for monthly dosing, the baseline was 16.2 days decreased to 11.4 at 12 weeks then to 8.3 in the OLE. In the CM quarterly dosing, the baseline of 16.4 days was reduced to 11.9 at 12 weeks and 9.9 days in the OLE. Randomized controlled trials of fremanezumab in both episodic cluster and post-traumatic headache are underway, but the trial for chronic cluster headache was stopped for futility. The most common adverse events are injection site pain (24% vs 22% for placebo), induration (17% vs 13% for placebo), and erythema (16% vs 12% for placebo). Severe adverse events were reported in 3.9% of the fremanezumab vs 3.7% of the placebo. No changes in vitals or ECG were reported. The long-term effects are not known, but the American Headache Society recommends that CGRP monoclonal antibodies be considered in EM or CM depending on previous medication trials and headache disability/frequency. Further, post-market studies are required, but for EM and CM fremanezumab is a new option for migraine preventive treatment.">

        <span class="abst" title="Headache is the third cause of visits to pediatric emergency departments (ED). According to a systematic review, headaches in children evaluated in the ED are primarily due to benign conditions that tend to be self-limiting or resolve with appropriate pharmacological treatment. The more frequent causes of non-traumatic headache in the ED include primitive headaches (21.8-66.3%) and benign secondary headaches (35.4-63.2%), whereas potentially life-threatening (LT) secondary headaches are less frequent (2-15.3%). Worrying conditions include brain tumors, central nervous system infections, dysfunction of ventriculo-peritoneal shunts, hydrocephalus, idiopathic intracranial hypertension, and intracranial hemorrhage. In the emergency setting, the main goal is to intercept potentially LT conditions that require immediate medical attention. The initial assessment begins with an in-depth, appropriate history followed by a complete, oriented physical and neurological examination. The literature describes the following red flags requiring further investigation (for example neuroimaging) for recognition of LT conditions: abnormal neurological examination; atypical presentation of headaches: subjective vertigo, intractable vomiting or headaches that wake the child from sleep; recent and progressive severe headache (&lt;6 months); age of the child &lt;6 years; no family history for migraine or primary headache; occipital headache; change of headache; new headache in an immunocompromised child; first or worst headache; symptoms and signs of systemic disease; headaches associated with changes in mental status or focal neurological disorders. In evaluating a child or adolescent who is being treated for headache, physicians should consider using appropriate diagnostic tests. Diagnostic tests are varied, and include routine laboratory analysis, cerebral spinal fluid examination, electroencephalography, and computerized tomography or magnetic resonance neuroimaging. The management of headache in the ED depends on the patient's general conditions and the presumable cause of the headache. There are few randomized, controlled trials on pharmacological treatment of headache in the pediatric population. Only ibuprofen and sumatriptan are significantly more effective than placebo in determining headache relief.">

A PubMed search with keywords &quot;migraine&quot; AND &quot;circadian&quot; resulted in ten studies directly investigating this topic. Results of these studies mostly show that migraine attacks follow a monophasic 24-hour cyclic pattern with an early morning or late night peak while other studies reported an afternoon peak and also a biphasic 24-hour cycle of attacks. The identified studies showed methodological variation including sample size, inclusion of medication use, comorbidities, and night or shift workers which could have contributed to the contradictory results. Several theories emerged explaining the diurnal distribution of migraine attacks suggesting roles for different phenomena including a morning rise in cortisol levels, a possible hypothalamic dysfunction, a circadian variation of migraine triggers, sleep stages, and a potentially different setting of the circadian pacemaker among migraineurs. At the moment, most studies show an early morning or late night peak of migraine attack onset, but a significant amount of studies reveals contradictory results. Further studies should investigate the arising hypotheses to improve our understanding of the complex mechanism behind the circadian variation of migraine attacks that can shed light on new targets for migraine therapy.">

        <span class="abst" title="Migraine is a major public health problem afflicting approximately 10% of the general population and is a leading cause of disability worldwide, yet our understanding of the basis mechanisms of migraine remains incomplete. About a third of migraine patients have attacks with aura, consisting of transient neurological symptoms that precede or accompany headache, or occur without headache. For patients, aura symptoms are alarming and may be transiently disabling. For clinicians and scientists, aura represents an intriguing neurophysiological event that may provide important insight into basic mechanisms of migraine. Several observations point toward important differences between migraine with and without aura. Compared with migraine without aura, migraine with aura has different heritability, greater association with different conditions including stroke, different alterations of brain structure and function as revealed by imaging studies. A number of studies also indicate that migraine with aura may respond differently to acute and preventive therapies as compared to migraine without aura. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of these differences in treatment responses, and to discuss the possibility of different therapeutic strategies for migraine with vs. without aura.">

        <span class="abst" title="BACKGROUND:Chronic migraine is a disabling condition that is currently underdiagnosed and undertreated. In this narrative review, we discuss the future of chronic migraine management in relation to recent progress in evidence-based pharmacological treatment. FINDINGS:Patients with chronic migraine require prophylactic therapy to reduce the frequency of migraine attacks, but the only currently available evidence-based prophylactic treatment options for chronic migraine are topiramate and onabotulinumtoxinA. Improved prophylactic therapy is needed to reduce the high burden of chronic migraine in Italy. Monoclonal antibodies that target the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) pathway of migraine pathogenesis have been specifically developed for the prophylactic treatment of chronic migraine. These anti-CGRP/R monoclonal antibodies have demonstrated good efficacy and excellent tolerability in phase II and III clinical trials, and offer new hope to patients who are currently not taking any prophylactic therapy or not benefitting from their current treatment. CONCLUSIONS:Treatment of chronic migraine is a dynamic and rapidly advancing area of research. New developments in this field have the potential to improve the diagnosis and provide more individualised treatments for this condition. Establishing a culture of prevention is essential for reducing the personal, social and economic burden of chronic migraine.">

        <span class="abst" title="OBJECTIVE:To investigate the whole-brain resting-state functional connectivity in patients with chronic migraine (CM) using a data-driven method. METHODS:We prospectively recruited patients with either episodic migraine (EM) or CM aged 18-60 years who visited the headache clinic of the Samsung Medical Center from July 2016 to December 2017. All patients underwent 3 T MRI using an identical scanner. Patients were considered interictal if they did not have a migraine headache at the day and ± 1 days of functional MRI acquisition. Using the group-independent component analysis (ICA), connectivity analysis with a weighted and undirected network model was performed. The between-group differences in degree centrality (DC) values were assessed using 5000 permutation tests corrected with false discovery rate (FDR). RESULTS:A total of 62 patients (44 EM and 18 CM) were enrolled in this study. Among the seven functionally interpretable spatially independent components (ICs) identified, only one IC, interpreted as the pain matrix, showed a significant between-group difference in DC (CM &gt; EM, p = 0.046). This association remained significant after adjustment for age, sex, migraine with aura (MWA), allodynia, depression, and anxiety (p = 0.038). The pain matrix was functionally correlated with the hypothalamus (p = 0.040, EM &gt; CM) and dorsal raphe nucleus (p = 0.039, CM &gt; EM) with different levels of strength in EM and CM. CONCLUSION:CM patients have a stronger connectivity in the pain matrix than do EM patients. Functional alteration of the pain network might play a role in migraine chronification.">

        <span class="abst" title="BACKGROUND:The burden of headache disorders, and of migraine in particular, is multifaceted and fragmented. The aim of this narrative review is to provide a description the main topics underlying the concepts of burden and impact of migraine disorders. MAIN RESULTS:MedLine has been searched for publications covering the period 1990-2018 dealing with the terms burden or impact of migraine, including both episodic and chronic migraine. The main results and themes are reported in a descriptive way, and were grouped by similarity of content into overarching categories. A total of 49 papers, published over 25 years (1994-2018), were retained for the qualitative analysis. Six main themes were identified: prevalence of migraine disorders, overall impact of migraine disorders, impact on work or school activities, family impact, interictal burden, and disease costs. Majority of included studies concluded that patients with migraine reported an higher burden or impact in one or more of the six main themes herein identified, compared to non-headache patients or to patients with tension-type headache, with a tendency towards worse outcomes consistently with higher headache frequency. CONCLUSIONS:The results of this narrative review show that the meaning of a sentence like &quot;migraine is a burdensome condition&quot; is not univocal: rather, it may refer to different concepts and meanings. In our opinion, future research should focus on understanding and facing the impact of migraine on work-related activities and on everyday life activities, as these aspects are highly connected to some tangible (i.e. cost) and less tangible (i.e. interictal burden and reduced quality of life) facets of migraine burden. Disease-specific measures have been implemented and should be exploited to enhance our understanding of migraine burden. This approach would allow to better understand the real impact on people's life of such a burdensome disease.">

        <span class="abst" title="BACKGROUND:New daily persistent headache (NDPH) presents with a sudden onset headache which continues without remission within 24 h. Although rare, NDPH is important because it is one of the most treatment refractory primary headache disorders and can be highly disabling to the individuals. In this structured review, we describe the current knowledge of epidemiology, clinical features, trigger factors, pathophysiology, diagnosis and therapeutic options of NDPH to better understand this enigmatic disorder. The prevalence of NDPH estimated to be 0.03% to 0.1% in the general population and is higher in children and adolescents than in adults. Individuals with NDPH can pinpoint the exact date their headache started. The pain is constant and lacks special characteristics but in some has migraine features. The exact pathogenic mechanism of NDPH is unknown, however pro-inflammatory cytokines and cervicogenic problems might play a role in its development. The diagnosis of NDPH is mainly clinical and based on a typical history, but proper laboratory investigation is needed to exclude secondary causes of headache. Regarding treatment strategy, controlled drug trials are absent. It is probably best to treat NDPH based upon the predominant headache phenotype. For patients who do not respond to common prophylactic drugs, ketamine infusion, onabotulinum toxin type A, intravenous (IV) lidocaine, IV methylprednisolone and nerve blockade are possible treatment options, but even aggressive treatment is usually ineffective. CONCLUSION:NDPH remains poorly understood but very burdensome for the individual. Multi-center randomized controlled trials are recommended to gain better understanding of NDPH and to establish evidence based treatments.">

        <span class="abst" title="BACKGROUND:Migraine is a complex neurovascular disorder with a strong genetic component. There are rare monogenic forms of migraine, as well as more common polygenic forms; research into the genes involved in both types has provided insights into the many contributing genetic factors. This review summarises advances that have been made in the knowledge and understanding of the genes and genetic variations implicated in migraine etiology. FINDINGS:Migraine is characterised into two main types, migraine without aura (MO) and migraine with aura (MA). Hemiplegic migraine is a rare monogenic MA subtype caused by mutations in three main genes - CACNA1A, ATP1A2 and SCN1A - which encode ion channel and transport proteins. Functional studies in cellular and animal models show that, in general, mutations result in impaired glutamatergic neurotransmission and cortical hyperexcitability, which make the brain more susceptible to cortical spreading depression, a phenomenon thought to coincide with aura symptoms. Variants in other genes encoding ion channels and solute carriers, or with roles in regulating neurotransmitters at neuronal synapses, or in vascular function, can also cause monogenic migraine, hemiplegic migraine and related disorders with overlapping symptoms. Next-generation sequencing will accelerate the finding of new potentially causal variants and genes, with high-throughput bioinformatics analysis methods and functional analysis pipelines important in prioritising, confirming and understanding the mechanisms of disease-causing variants. With respect to common migraine forms, large genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have greatly expanded our knowledge of the genes involved, emphasizing the role of both neuronal and vascular pathways. Dissecting the genetic architecture of migraine leads to greater understanding of what underpins relationships between subtypes and comorbid disorders, and may have utility in diagnosis or tailoring treatments. Further work is required to identify causal polymorphisms and the mechanism of their effect, and studies of gene expression and epigenetic factors will help bridge the genetics with migraine pathophysiology. CONCLUSIONS:The complexity of migraine disorders is mirrored by their genetic complexity. A comprehensive knowledge of the genetic factors underpinning migraine will lead to improved understanding of molecular mechanisms and pathogenesis, to enable better diagnosis and treatments for migraine sufferers.">

Primary headaches, especially migraine, are cyclic disorders with a complex sequence of symptoms within every headache attack. There is no systematic review of whether these symptoms changes during lifespan. Indeed, the clinical presentation of migraine shows an age-dependent change with a significantly shorter duration of the attacks and occurrence of different paroxysmal symptoms, such as vomiting, abdominal pain or vertigo, in childhood and, in contrast, largely an absence of autonomic signs and a more often bilateral headache in the elderly. The age-dependent differences in the clinical presentation are less distinct in cluster headache and, especially, in tension-type headache. The differences in the clinical presentation are in agreement with the idea that the connectivity of hypothalamic areas with different brainstem areas, especially the central parasympathetic areas, is important for the clinical manifestation of migraine, as well as, the change during lifespan.">

        <span class="abst" title="BACKGROUND:Research in migraine points towards central-peripheral complexity with a widespread pattern of structures involved. Migraine-associated neck and shoulder muscle pain has clinically been conceptualized as myofascial trigger points (mTrPs). However, concepts remain controversial, and the identification of mTrPs is mostly restricted to manual palpation in clinical routine. This study investigates a more objective, quantitative assessment of mTrPs by means of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with T2 mapping. METHODS:Ten subjects (nine females, 25.6 ± 5.2 years) with a diagnosis of migraine according to ICHD-3 underwent bilateral manual palpation of the upper trapezius muscles to localize mTrPs. Capsules were attached to the skin adjacent to the palpated mTrPs for marking. MRI of the neck and shoulder region was performed at 3 T, including a T2-prepared, three-dimensional (3D) turbo spin echo (TSE) sequence. The T2-prepared 3D TSE sequence was used to generate T2 maps, followed by manual placement of regions of interest (ROIs) covering the trapezius muscles of both sides and signal alterations attributable to mTrPs. RESULTS:The trapezius muscles showed an average T2 value of 27.7 ± 1.4 ms for the right and an average T2 value of 28.7 ± 1.0 ms for the left side (p = 0.1055). Concerning signal alterations in T2 maps attributed to mTrPs, nine values were obtained for the right (32.3 ± 2.5 ms) and left side (33.0 ± 1.5 ms), respectively (p = 0.0781). When comparing the T2 values of the trapezius muscles to the T2 values extracted from the signal alterations attributed to the mTrPs of the ipsilateral side, we observed a statistically significant difference (p = 0.0039). T2 hyperintensities according to visual image inspection were only reported in four subjects for the right and in two subjects for the left side. CONCLUSIONS:Our approach enables the identification of mTrPs and their quantification in terms of T2 mapping even in the absence of qualitative signal alterations. Thus, it (1) might potentially challenge the current gold-standard method of physical examination of mTrPs, (2) could allow for more targeted and objectively verifiable interventions, and (3) could add valuable models to understand better central-peripheral mechanisms in migraine.">

        <span class="abst" title="Objective: To identify pediatric patients with sensory sensitivities during a hospital visit, and to implement a clinical pathway that can meet their sensory needs. The goal is to remove barriers to care delivery that is related to the sensory need for pediatric patients who present with an acute medical illness. Methods: The clinical pathway (identified as 'Sensory Pathway') was developed as a joint effort between key stakeholders within the community and medical providers. The pathway was conducted in a tertiary pediatric hospital from September 2016-April 2019. The main components of this pathway included- 1. Staff training; 2. Provision of sensory toolkits and story board; 3. Early collaboration with allied professionals; and 4. Early and continuous parental involvement. The Sensory Pathway was implemented first in the emergency department, followed by inpatient units. Patients triggered the pathway through caregiver or staff identification. Demographic of patients who triggered the pathway was extracted. A detailed qualitative analysis of any parents' feedback received was performed. Results: A cohort of patients with sensory needs was identified amongst pediatric patients who presented to the hospital with an acute illness. The most common comorbidity associated with sensory sensitivity/need was Autism Spectrum Disorder (48%), followed by cerebral palsy (22.8%) and Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (16%). 1337 patients (51.8%) had a single comorbidity while 45.9% patients had more than one comorbidity. Only 1.3% patients had a known diagnosis of sensory processing disorder. The pathway was triggered in 2,580 patient visits with 1643 patients and 937 repeat visits. The vast majority of patients who triggered the pathway had a medical presenting complaint (vs. behavioral). The following themes emerged from the parents' feedback: 1. Additional help received specific to the child's sensory needs; 2. Feeling of comfort; and 3. Improved overall experience. Conclusion: The Sensory Pathway identified a unique profile of pediatric patients who have sensory needs during their hospital stay. The pathway was successfully implemented for children with sensory need in our hospital across a wide range of demographic and with varied medical illness.">

        <span class="abst" title="Until recently, advances in understanding the genetic architecture of psychiatric disorders have been impeded by a historic, and often mandated, commitment to the use of traditional, and unvalidated, categorical diagnoses in isolation as the relevant phenotype. Such studies typically required lengthy structured interviews to delineate differences in the character and duration of behavioral symptomatology amongst disorders that were thought to be etiologic, and they were often underpowered as a result. Increasing acceptance of the fact that co-morbidity in psychiatric disorders is the rule rather than the exception has led to alternative designs in which shared dimensional symptomatology is analyzed as a quantitative trait and to association analyses in which combined polygenic risk scores are computationally compared across multiple traditional categorical diagnoses to identify both distinct and unique genetic and environmental elements. Increasing evidence that most mental disorders share many common genetic risk variants and environmental risk modifiers suggests that the broad spectrum of psychiatric pathology represents the pleiotropic display of a more limited series of pathologic events in neuronal development than was originally believed, regulated by many common risk variants and a smaller number of rare ones.">

METHODS:We carried a retrospective study of adult large ASD (defined as ≥25 mm) treated by percutaneous closure using Amplatzer septal occluder during 12-year period (May 2003-February 2015) at a single tertiary center. A total of 269 patients were divided into 2 groups, according to the pre-procedural maximal ASD diameter; 25 mm≤ASD&lt;35mm, group 1 (n=216) and 35 mm≤ASD, group 2 (n=53). We compared procedural parameters, early complications and long-term follow-up results between 2 groups. RESULTS:The need of modified implantation techniques (MITs) was higher group 2 (23.6% vs. 37.7%, p=0.034). Procedural success rate was considerably high in both groups (99.1% in group 1 vs. 100% in group 2, p=0.620). Major complications were occurred in 4 (1.5%) patients (1.4% vs. 1.9%, p=0.804). Minor complication rate was not different between 2 groups. During long-term follow-up (47.2±32.0 months, range, 6.0-135.5), there was one major complication (0.4%) of stroke. Most common long-term minor event was migraine headache (3.9%) followed by arrhythmias (1.9%) without statistical difference between 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS:Although MIT was more frequently required in very large ASD groups, the procedural, early and long-term outcomes after percutaneous ASD closure were similar in both groups. This suggested that percutaneous ASD closure for very large ASD could be considered a good treatment option.">

        <span class="abst" title="Pain experience is a negative complex phenomenon influenced by several mechanisms. Attachment processes may affect the way in which individuals experience and signal pain. Hence, in the last two decades, the role of attachment quality has drawn attention in pain research and practice. However, previous reviews on this topic focused on adulthood and/or specific types or pain. We conducted a narrative review examining the association between attachment and different pain conditions from infancy to adolescence. Two independent researchers searched scientific databases for relevant papers. A total of 17 articles were included. Results highlight the following: (a) children and adolescents with chronic idiopathic pain showed low rates of attachment security compared to control groups; (b) pain conditions are consistently associated with elevated rates of at-risk pattern of attachment and information processing; and (c) the presence of unresolved trauma or loss is higher in children and adolescent who experienced pain compared to healthy controls. Despite the significance of these empirical evidences, the impact of caregiving environment and interpersonal context on pain experience in infancy and preschool age is poorly investigated compared to adulthood. Research on pain and attachment needs to be extended since the majority of the studies are limited to specific pain conditions. Future research should investigate the role of anxious attachment on procedural pain and transition from acute to chronic pain, testing new conceptual models. These findings shed light on the importance of relational factors and psychosocial vulnerabilities in pain clinical practice. An attachment-informed approach to pain will help health professionals to offer adequate support during procedures and to increase effectiveness of interventions. A developmental perspective is needed to integrate familial and relational contribution into a multimodal assessment and treatment of pain. Longitudinal studies are recommended.">

        <span class="abst" title="BACKGROUND:Perampanel is a novel antiepileptic drug acting via non-competitive antagonism on glutamatergic AMPA receptors, and the subsequent inhibition of ion calcium influx. Since it was recently postulated that the antagonists of glutamate receptors might play a role in the treatment of migraine, in this study we investigated the putative anti-migraine activity of perampanel in an in vitro animal model involving the static incubation of rat brainstem explants and the subsequent measurement of immune-reactive calcitonin gene-related peptide released into the incubation medium. METHODS:Acute rat brainstem explants were incubated in plain medium or in medium containing graded concentrations of perampanel. The release into the medium was assessed by radioimmunoassay either under baseline conditions or after stimulation by such secretagogues as high K+ concentrations, veratridine or capsaicin. RESULTS:We found that: 1) under baseline conditions perampanel, given in the range 0.01-100 μM, inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner calcitonin gene-related peptide's release compared to controls; the decrease was statistically significant as from 10 μM; 2) a significant and consistent increase in calcitonin gene-related peptide's secretion was induced by all depolarizing stimuli after 1 h of incubation; 3) under these conditions, calcitonin gene-related peptide's release stimulated by 56 mM KCl was significantly reduced by perampanel from 0.1 μM onward, whereas secretion stimulated by veratridine was significantly reduced as from 1 μM; 4) on the contrary, perampanel had no effect on capsaicin-induced calcitonin gene-related peptide's release up to 100 μM. CONCLUSIONS:Here we provided preliminary in vitro evidence suggesting that perampanel might control pain transmission under conditions of activated trigeminal system, in a preclinical model mimicking the pathophysiology of human migraine.">

METHODS:Patients with symptoms of Airplane Headache were recruited from nine Italian Pediatric Headache Centres. Each patient was handed a structured questionnaire which met the ICHD-III criteria. RESULTS:Among 320 children suffering from primary headaches who had flights during their lifetime, 15 (4.7%) had Airplane Headache, with mean age of 12.4 years. Most of the patients were females (80%). The headache was predominantly bilateral (80%) and localized to the frontal area (60%); it was mainly pulsating, and lasted less than 30 min in all cases. Accompanying symptoms were tearing, photophobia, phonophobia in most of the cases (73.3%). More than 30% of patients used medications to treat the attacks, with good results. CONCLUSION:Our study shows that Airplane Headache is not a rare disorder in children affected by primary headaches and highlights that its features in children are peculiar and differ from those described in adults. In children Airplane Headache prevails in females, is more often bilateral, has frequently accompanying symptoms and occurs at any time during the flight. Further studies are needed to confirm the actual frequency of Airplane Headache in the general pediatric population not selected from specialized Headache Centres, with and without other concomitant headache condition, and to better clarify the clinical characteristics, pathophysiology and potential therapies.">

        <span class="abst" title="Background:Headache is the most common neurological symptoms worldwide, as over 90% of people have noted at least one headache during their lifetime. Tension-type headaches, cervicogenic headaches, and migraines are common types of headache which can have a significant impact on social, physical, and occupational functioning. Therapeutic management of headaches mainly includes physical therapy and pharmacological interventions. Dry needling is a relatively new therapeutic approach that uses a thin filiform needle without injectate to penetrate the skin and stimulate underlying tissues for the management of neuromusculoskeletal pain and movement impairments.The main objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to evaluate the effectiveness of dry needling in comparison to other interventions on pain and disability in patients with tension-type headache, cervicogenic headache, and migraine. Methods/design:We will focus on clinical trials with concurrent control group(s) and comparative observational studies assessing the effect of dry needling in patients with tension-type headache, cervicogenic headache, and migraine. Electronic databases from relevant fields of research (PubMed/ Medline, Scopus, Embase®, PEDro, Web of Science, Ovid, AMED, CENTRAL, and Google Scholar) will be searched from inception to June 2019 using defined search terms. No restrictions for language of publication or geographic location will be applied. Moreover, grey literature, citation tracking, and reference lists scanning of the selected studies will be searched manually. Primary outcomes of this study are pain intensity and disability, and secondary outcomes are cervical spine ROM, frequency of headaches, health-related quality of life, and TrPs tenderness. Studies will be selected by three independent reviewers based on prespecified eligibility criteria. Three reviewers will independently extract data in each eligible study using a pre-piloted Microsoft Excel data extraction form. The assessment of risk of bias will be implemented using the Cochrane Back and Neck Review Group 13-item criteria and NOS. Direct meta-analysis will be performed using a fixed or random effects model to estimate effect size such as standardized mean difference (Morris's d ppc ) and 95% confidence intervals. Statistical heterogeneity will also be evaluated using the I 2 statistic and the χ2 test. All meta-analyses will be performed using Stata V.11 and V.14 softwares. The overall quality of the evidence for the primary outcomes will be assessed using GRADE. Discussion:All analyses in this study will be based on the previous published papers. Therefore, ethical approval and patient consent are not required. The findings of this study will provide important information on the value of dry needling for the management of tension-type headache, cervicogenic headache, and migraine.

        <span class="abst" title="OBJECTIVE:While pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is rare in infants and children, it results in substantial morbidity and mortality. In recent years, prognosis has improved, coinciding with the introduction of new PAH-targeted therapies, although much of their use in children is off-label. Evidence to guide the treatment of children with PAH is less extensive than for adults. The goal of this review is to discuss the treatment recommendations for children with PAH, as well as the evidence supporting the use of prostanoids, endothelin receptor antagonists (ERAs), and phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (PDE5i) in this setting. DATA SOURCES:Nonsystematic PubMed literature search and authors' expertise. STUDY SELECTION:Articles were selected concentrating on the nitric oxide (NO)-soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC)-cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) pathway in PAH. The methodology of an ongoing study evaluating the sGC stimulator riociguat in children with PAH is also described. RESULTS:Despite recent medical advances, improved therapeutic strategies for pediatric PAH are needed. The efficacy and tolerability of riociguat in adults with PAH have been well trialed. CONCLUSION:The pooling of data across trials, supplemented by registry data, will help to confirm the safety and tolerability of prostanoids, ERAs, and PDE5i in children. Ongoing studies will clarify the place of sGC stimulators in the treatment strategy for pediatric PAH.">

        <span class="abst" title="Background. Temporomandibular joint dysfunction (TMD) is a term that describes problems in the masticatory system, including the temporomandibular joint, the dento-muscular system and the supporting bones. Injection of botulinum toxin, as a noninvasive technique, might be useful in decreasing symptoms such as muscular spasm, dystonia, migraine headaches and TMD. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of injection of botulinum toxin on decreasing the symptoms and signs of masticatory muscles in patients with TMD. Methods. A total of 61 patients were consecutively included in the present study in 2016‒2017. All the subjects received a 50-unit injection of Dysport botulinum toxin in the masseter muscles using an extraoral injection technique. The results of the injection were evaluated in terms of pain severity using VAS, clinical evaluations of the joint click through palpation and by determining the inter-incisal distance. The patients underwent follow-up examinations at 1-week, 3-month and 6-month intervals after injection. Data were analyzed with appropriate statistical tests. Results. Comparison of pain severity and articular clicks at different intervals showed decreases in these parameters over time, with significant differences between the time intervals (P&lt;0.05). Comparison of mouth opening at different intervals showed increases in mouth opening over time. Conclusion. The results of the present study showed that injection of botulinum toxin can be used in patients with TMD as a non-invasive treatment modality.">

        <span class="abst" title="Background:Recurrent painful ophthalmoplegic neuropathy (RPON), previously known as ophthalmoplegic migraine (OM), is an uncommon disorder with repeated episodes of ocular cranial nerve neuropathy associated with ipsilateral headache. The age of presentation is most often during childhood or adolescence. MRI has a central role in the assessment of the RPON, especially to distinguish orbital, parasellar, or posterior fossa lesions that mimic symptoms of RPON. Actually, oculomotor nerve tumors may be masquerade as RPON so that MRI follow-ups are required to detect the possibility of tumor etiology. Case presentation:We report a 16-year-old boy with a 7-year follow-up and multiple brain MRI data, previously diagnosed as OM. The last brain MRI, performed during an acute phase of oculomotor paresis with ipsilateral headache, showed a nodular lesion described as schwannoma of III cranial nerve. Then, we reviewed the literature on OM and RPON in pediatric age with a focus on brain MRI findings. Conclusions:This review highlights the important role of serial brain MRIs in the long-term follow-up of RPON, especially in the cases with childhood onset, in order to not delay the diagnosis of a possible oculomotor nerve schwannoma.">

Recent advances in the understanding of the gut microbiome have shown the role of gut micro-organisms in disease outcomes for distant organs-including the brain. Interventions targeting the gut microbiome have been shown to be effective in multiple neurological diagnoses, but there is little research into the role of the microbiome in migraine. This systematic review seeks to assess the current research landscape of randomized placebo controlled trials utilizing probiotic interventions as migraine prophylaxis. Searches were conducted of scientific databases including PubMed, MEDLINE, and the Cochrane Library, following PRISMA guidelines. Of 68 screened studies, 2 were eligible for analysis. Due to methodological differences, meta-analysis was not possible. Qualitative comparison of the studies demonstrated a dichotomy of results-one trial reported no significant change in migraine frequency and intensity, while the second trial reported highly significant improvements. No clear 'gold standard' currently exists for microbiome research, let alone for migraine-related microbiome research. The heterogeneity of outcome measures used in the two trials included in this systematic review shows the need for a standardization of outcome measures, therefore a series of recommendations for future probiotic-migraine research are included.">

The biopsychosocial model of pain, which accounts for the complex interplay of the biological, psychological, social, and environmental factors that contribute to and maintain pain symptoms and related disability has guided our understanding and treatment of pediatric pain. Consequently, many interventions for chronic pain are within the realm of rehabilitation, based on the premise that behavior has a broad and central role in pain management. These treatments are typically delivered by one or more providers in medicine, nursing, psychology, physical therapy, and/or occupational therapy. Current data suggest that multidisciplinary treatment is important, with intensive interdisciplinary pain rehabilitation (IIPT) being effective at reducing disability for patients with high levels of functional disability. The following review describes the current state of the art of rehabilitation approaches to treat persistent pain in children and adolescents. Several emerging areas of interventions are also highlighted to guide future research and clinical practice.">

        <span class="abst" title="BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE:Benign epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (BECTS) is one of the most common pediatric epilepsies, and it generally has a good prognosis. However, recent research has indicated that the epileptic activity of BECTS can cause cognitive defects such as language, visuospatial, and auditory verbal memory deficits. This study assessed language-delivery deficits in BECTS patients using diffusion-tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DTI). METHODS:T1-weighted MRI, DTI, and language tests were conducted in 16 BECTS patients and 16 age-matched controls. DTI data were analyzed using the TRActs Constrained by Underlying Anatomy tool in FreeSurfer 5.3, and 18 major white-matter tracts were extracted, which included 4 language-related tracts: the inferior longitudinal fasciculus, superior longitudinal fasciculus-parietal terminations, superior longitudinal fasciculus-temporal terminations, and uncinate fasciculus (UNC). Language tests included the Korean version of the Receptive and Expressive Vocabulary Test, Test of Problem-Solving Abilities (TOPS), and the mean length of utterance in words. RESULTS:The BECTS group exhibited decreased mean fractional anisotropy and increased mean radial diffusivity, with significant differences in both the superior longitudinal fasciculus and the left UNC (p&lt;0.05), which are the language-related white-matter tracts in the dual-loop model. The TOPS language test scores were significantly lower in the BECTS group than in the control group (p&lt;0.05). CONCLUSIONS:It appears that BECTS patients can exhibit language deficits. Seizure activities of BECTS could alter DTI scalar values in the language-related white-matter tracts.">

On numerous occasions, her 24-hour urine calcium was more than 4 mg/kg/day, consistent with PHPT, but her fractional excretion of calcium on 24-hour urine collection was consistently below 1%, in line with FHH. 99mTc-Sestamibi scan failed to detect any abnormalities. However, a 4-dimensional computed tomography scan of the neck revealed a right superior parathyroid adenoma which was excised with a focused parathyroidectomy. Although the patient's calcium and iPTH levels normalized, her nonspecific symptoms persisted.

Despite the very high prevalence of PTH, there are no evidence-based guidelines for PTH treatment. Thus, we found it timely to provide a systematic review of the current literature on acute and preventive pharmacological treatment of PTH using PubMed and Embase databases. FINDINGS:Included studies involved acute and preventive pharmacological treatment of headache attributed to traumatic injury to the head in adherence to the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD) criteria. Of 1424 potentially relevant articles identified, 63 were retrieved for detailed evaluation and seven studies (one prospective and six retrospective) met the inclusion criteria. None of the seven included studies were randomized clinical trials (RCTs) or used a placebo-controlled study design. CONCLUSION:We found that there is a lack of high-quality evidence-based studies on the pharmacological treatment of PTH. Future studies are highly needed and must emphasize open-label studies with rigorous methodology or RCTs with a placebo-controlled design.">

        <span class="abst" title="Background: Data on clinical presentation of Hemiplegic Migraine (HM) are quite limited in the literature, particularly in the pediatric age. The aim of the present study is to describe in detail the phenotypic features at onset and during the first years of disease of sporadic (SHM) and familial (FHM) pediatric hemiplegic migraine and to review the pertinent literature. Results: Retrospective study of a cohort of children and adolescents diagnosed with hemiplegic migraine, recruited from 11 Italian specialized Juvenile Headache Centers. Forty-six cases (24 females) were collected and divided in two subgroups: 32 SHM (16 females), 14 FHM (8 females). Mean age at onset was 10.5 ± 3.8 y (range: 2-16 y). Mean duration of motor aura was 3.5 h (range: 5 min-48 h). SHM cases experienced more prolonged attacks than FHM cases, with significantly longer duration of both motor aura and of total HM attack. Sensory (65%) and basilar-type auras (63%) were frequently associated to the motor aura, without significant differences between SHM and FHM. At follow-up (mean duration 4.4 years) the mean frequency of attacks was 2.2 per year in the first year after disease onset, higher in FHM than in SHM cases (3.9 vs. 1.5 per year, respectively). A literature review retrieved seven studies, all but one were based on mixed adults and children cohorts. Conclusions: This study represents the first Italian pediatric series of HM ever reported, including both FHM and SHM patients. Our cohort highlights that in the pediatric HM has an heterogeneous clinical onset. Children present fewer non-motor auras as compared to adults and in some cases the first attack is preceded by transient neurological signs and symptoms in early childhood. In SHM cases, attacks were less frequent but more severe and prolonged, while FHM patients had less intense but more frequent attacks and a longer phase of active disease. Differently from previous studies, the majority of our cases, even with early onset and severe attacks, had a favorable clinical evolution.">

Various symptoms can be associated with vomiting such as nausea, migraine or abdominal pain. Common triggers of CVS include infection, psychological stress and menstruation. CVS's diagnosis requires exclusion of alternative diseases particularly neurological and gastrointestinal. CVS shares many common features with catamenial migraine including treatment. We herein report a case of CVS in a 16 years old girl characterized by stereotypical vomiting attacks occurring in every menstrual period. Recurrent vomiting episodes began 2 years before admission. Given the negativity of paraclinical exams and the absence of response to different therapeutic approaches as well as the similarity with catamenial migraine, we treated our patient with permenstrual percutaneous oestrogen for six months. The evolution was marked by the disappearance of symptoms within the first month and the absence of their recurrence after treatment cessation during a follow-up of 6 years.">

Recently, an increasing number of psychiatric drugs has been proven to possess suppressing activities against brain tumors, and rapid progress has been made in understanding the potential mechanisms of action of these drugs. In particular, the traditional mood stabilizer valproic acid, the widely used antidepressants fluoxetine and escitalopram oxalate, and the atypical psychiatric drug aripiprazole have demonstrated promise for application in brain tumor treatment strategies through multiple lines of laboratory, preclinical, and clinical evidence. The unexpected discovery of the anticancer properties of these drugs has ignited interest in the repurposing of other psychiatric drugs to combat brain cancer. In this review, we synthesize recent progress in understanding the potential molecular mechanisms underlying the brain cancer-killing activities of representative psychiatric drugs. We also identify key limitations in the repurposing of these medications that must be overcome to enhance our ability to successfully prevent and treat brain cancer, especially in the most vulnerable groups of patients, such as children and adolescents, pregnant women, and those with unfavorable genetic variants. Moreover, we propose perspectives that may guide future research and provide long-awaited new hope to patients with brain cancer and their families.">

POTS is a clinical syndrome characterized by orthostatic symptoms and excessive postural tachycardia without orthostatic hypotension. Active research from the medical and scientific community has led to controversy over POTS diagnosis and treatment, yet patients continue to present with symptoms associated with POTS+pain, making treatment recommendations critical. This topical review examines the literature on diagnosing and treating pediatric POTS+pain and the challenges clinicians face. Most importantly, clinicians must employ an interdisciplinary team approach to determine the ideal combination of pharmacologic (e.g., fludrocortisone), non-pharmacologic (e.g., physical therapy, integrative medicine), and psychological (e.g., cognitive behavioral therapy, psychoeducation) treatment approaches that acknowledge the complexity of the child's condition, while simultaneously tailoring these approaches to the child's personal needs. We provide recommendations for treatment for youth with POTS+pain based on the current literature.">

        <span class="abst" title="In recent years, genetic techniques of diagnosis have shown rapid development, resulting in a modified clinical approach to many diseases, including neurological disorders. Movement disorders, in particular those arising in childhood, pose a diagnostic challenge. First, from a purely phenomenological point of view, the correct clinical classification of signs and symptoms may be difficult and require expert evaluation. This is because the clinical picture is often a mixture of hyperkinetic and hypokinetic disorders, and within hyperkinetic movement disorders, combined phenotypes are not unusual. Second, although several genes that cause movement disorders in children are now well-known, many of them have only been described in adult populations or discovered in patients after many years of disease. Furthermore, diseases that alter their mechanisms from childhood to adulthood are still little known, and many phenotypes in children are the result of a disruption of normal neurodevelopment. High-throughput gene screening addresses these difficulties and has modified the approach to genetic diagnosis. In the exome-sequencing era, customized genetic panels now offer the ability to perform fast and low-cost screening of the genes commonly involved in the pathogenesis of the disease. Here, we describe a 3-year study using a customized gene panel for pediatric-onset movement disorders in a selected cohort of children and adolescents. We report a satisfying diagnostic yield, further confirming the usefulness of gene panel analysis.">

In Indian subcontinent, there are few reports on narcolepsy and none on IHS so far. Here, we compared the clinical and polysomnographic profile of narcolepsy/IHS among the pediatric and adult groups. Materials and Methods:The patients presenting with excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) attending sleep clinic from January 2010 to December 2015 were included. Patients were diagnosed with narcolepsy type 1 (NT1), narcolepsy type 2 (NT2), and IHS based on the International Classification for Sleep Disorders criteria. Patients with secondary causes of EDS were excluded from the study. Results:A total of 56 patients were included in the study (29 males and 27 females). The mean age of symptom onset was 29 years (males - 34 years and females - 24 years). Twelve (21%) patients had NT1, five (9%) patients had NT2, whereas 38 (68%) patients had IHS compared to narcolepsy, the IHS had an older mean age at presentation. The average time from symptom onset to diagnosis was 71 months. Classical tetrad of narcolepsy was rarely found in pediatric cohort, but they had more behavioral problems and weight gain. Pediatric cohort of IHS also reported behavioral problems. The mean sleep-onset latency was 3.1 min, while the mean rapid eye movement latency was 7.2 min. Conclusion:The pediatric narcolepsy patients tend to have less classical symptoms and more behavioral/eating problems as compared to adult cohort. There is significant delay in diagnosing narcolepsy, indicating the need to increase awareness among the physicians about this rare treatable disorder.">

        <span class="abst" title="The global prevalence of migraine as a primary headache has been estimated as 14.4% in both sexes. Migraine headache has been ranked as the highest contributor to disability in under 50 years old population in the world. Extensive research has been conducted in order to clarify the pathological mechanisms of migraine. Although uncertainties remains, it has been indicated that vascular dysfunction, cortical spreading depression (CSD), activation of the trigeminovascular pathway, pro-inflammatory and oxidative state may play a putative role in migraine pain generation. Knowledge about pathophysiological mechanisms of migraine should be integrated into a multimodal treatment approach to increase quality of life in patients. With respect to this, within the integrative health studies growing interest pertains to dietary interventions. Although the number of studies concerning effects of diet on headache/migraine is not yet very large, the current article will review the available evidence in this area. All publications on headache/migraine and dietary interventions up to May 2019 were included in the present review through a PubMed/MEDLINE and ScienceDirect database search. According to the current findings, Ketogenic diet and modified Atkins diet are thought to play a role in neuroprotection, improving mitochondrial function and energy metabolism, compensating serotoninergic dysfunction, decreasing calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) level and suppressing neuro-inflammation. It can also be speculated that prescription of low glycemic diet may be promising in headache/migraine control through attenuating the inflammatory state. Moreover, obesity and headaches including migraine could be attributed to each other through mechanisms like inflammation, and irregular hypothalamic function. Thereby, applying dietary strategies for weight loss may also ameliorate headache/migraine. Another important dietary intervention that might be effective in headache/migraine improvement is related to balance between the intake of essential fatty acids, omega-6 and omega-3 which also affect inflammatory responses, platelet function and regulation of vascular tone. Regarding elimination diets, it appears that targeted these diets in migraine patients with food sensitivities could be effective in headache/migraine prevention. Taken together, dietary approaches that could be considered as effective strategies in headache/migraine prophylaxis include weight loss diets in obese headache patients, ketogenic and low-calorie diets, reducing omega-6 and increasing omega-3 fatty acid intakes.">

This condition occurs in one-fifth of celiac disease (CD) patients and usually represents a clinical challenge. We reviewed genetic, histologic, and clinical features of this specific condition by performing a systematic search on MEDLINE, Embase, and Scholar database. Accordingly, we identified different genetic features in patients with PCD compared to the classical forms. Frequently, signs of inflammation (deposits of immunoglobulin A (IgA) and/or increased number of intraepithelial lymphocytes) can be clearly identify in the mucosa of PCD patients after an accurate histological assessment. Finally, the main challenge is represented by the treatment: the gluten-free diet should be considered only in the presence of gluten-dependent symptoms in both children and adults. What is known: (i) potential celiac disease (PCD) occurs in one-fifth of all celiac diseases (CD), and (ii) despite the absence of classical lesions, clear signs of inflammation are often detectable. What is new: (i) patients with PCD show different genetic features, and (ii) the presence of gluten-dependent symptoms is the main determinant to initiate the gluten-free diet, after a complete diagnostic work-up.">

        <span class="abst" title="Pediatric-onset multiple sclerosis (POMS) is an immune-mediated, demyelinating, neurodegenerative disease that accounts for 3-5% of all multiple sclerosis (MS) cases. Although evidence suggests that it has similar risk factors and disease pathophysiology as adult-onset MS (AOMS), there are distinctive features in disease characteristics and patient demographics of POMS that require unique therapeutic development and treatment considerations. Gilenya® (Novartis International AG, Basel, Switzerland) (fingolimod) is a sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulator that prevents lymphocytic outflow from peripheral lymph nodes. It has demonstrated efficacy in AOMS. In POMS, there have been three observational studies and one pivotal clinical trial evaluating the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of fingolimod. Currently, fingolimod is the only Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency approved disease-modifying therapy to treat POMS. This review will critically evaluate the available evidence of fingolimod in the treatment of POMS in detail, as well as discussing its treatment implications.">

        <span class="abst" title="INTRODUCTION:Ischemic stroke is an extremely rare disorder in children. The timely diagnosis is essential for the outcome of these children, but unfortunately, delays in diagnosis occur frequently. PATIENT CONCERNS:We report the case of a 7-month-old infant admitted in our clinic for limited movements of the superior and inferior right limbs whose onset was 27 hours before with repeated clonic movements of the right hand associated with the same manifestations in the right oral commissure lasting approximately 10 seconds. DIAGNOSIS:The laboratory tests revealed high D-dimers, and positive IgG anti-cardiolipin and anti-beta2 glycoproteins I antibodies, whereas the genetic profile for thrombophilia revealed heterozygote mutation in MTHFR C677T and A1298C genes. Brain imaging established the diagnosis of left frontal ischemic stroke, frontal ischemic stroke, hypoplasia of internal carotid artery, and agenesia of segment M1 of median cerebral artery and segment A1 of left anterior cerebral artery. INTERVENTION:We administered low-molecular-weight heparin, antiplatelet therapy along with vasodilators and depletive treatment, wide-spectrum antibiotics, and anticonvulsant therapy. OUTCOME:The neurological deficit was greatly improved, especially in the inferior limb after 6 month from the incident of stroke, and all laboratory parameters were within normal limits including the antibodies mentioned above. CONCLUSION:Cerebral vascular malformation, excessive weight, and altered lipid profiles contributed to the development of acute ischemic stroke in our patient.">

Concurrently, prevalence estimates suggest 10% of individuals identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or questioning/queer. The preponderance of female POTS patients implies hormonal differences between natal sexes and their role in POTS. Transgender POTS patients using hormone therapies may offer further insight into the mechanism of POTS. There have been no previously published studies of transgender patients with POTS undergoing gender-affirming hormone therapy. Methods: We reviewed our electronic health record for clinical histories of transgender patients in our POTS Database. Results: Three patients who transitioned from female to male demonstrated clinical improvement of their POTS symptoms with the addition of testosterone therapy. Conclusion: We present our clinical experience of three transgender POTS patients who transitioned from female to male with hormone therapy, all of whom demonstrated clinical improvement with testosterone. This may give further insight into the pathophysiology of POTS. However, the authors do not endorse the use of hormone therapy as primary therapy for the symptoms of POTS.">

        <span class="abst" title="BACKGROUND:Resting-state functional connectivity (FC) MRI has widely been used to understand migraine pathophysiology and to identify an imaging marker of the disorder. Here, we review what we have learned from FC studies. METHODS:We performed a literature search on the PubMed website for original articles reporting data obtained from conventional resting-state FC recording in migraine patients compared with healthy controls or during and outside of migraine attacks in the same patients. RESULTS:We found 219 articles and included 28 in this review after screening for inclusion and exclusion criteria. Twenty-five studies compared migraine patients with healthy controls, whereas three studies investigated migraine patients during and outside of attacks. In the studies of interictal migraine more alterations of more than 20 FC networks (including amygdala, caudate nucleus, central executive, cerebellum, cuneus, dorsal attention network, default mode, executive control, fronto-parietal, hypothalamus, insula, neostriatum, nucleus accumbens, occipital lobe, periaqueductal grey, prefrontal cortex, salience, somatosensory cortex I, thalamus and visual) were reported. We found a poor level of reproducibility and no migraine specific pattern across these studies. CONCLUSION:Based on the findings in the present review, it seems very difficult to extract knowledge of migraine pathophysiology or to identify a biomarker of migraine. There is an unmet need of guidelines for resting-state FC studies in migraine, which promote the use of homogenous terminology, public availability of protocol and the a priori hypothesis in line with for instance randomized clinical trial guidelines.">

A likely pathogenetic mechanism is a central dopaminergic dysfunction. The exact role of pain system is unclear. The purpose of the study was to investigate the nociceptive pathways in idiopathic RLS patients. We enrolled 11 patients (mean age 53.2 ± 19.7 years; 7 men) suffering from severe, primary RLS. We recorded scalp laser-evoked potentials (LEPs) to stimulation of different sites (hands and feet) and during two different time conditions (daytime and nighttime). Finally, we compared the results with a matched control group of healthy subjects. The Aδ responses obtained from patients did not differ from those recorded from control subjects. However, the N1 and the N2-P2 amplitudes' night/day ratios after foot stimulation were increased in patients, as compared to controls (N1: patients: 133.91 ± 50.42%; controls: 83.74 ± 34.45%; p = 0.016; Aδ-N2-P2: patients: 119.15 ± 15.56%; controls: 88.42 ± 23.41%; p = 0.003). These results suggest that RLS patients present circadian modifications in the pain system, which are not present in healthy controls. Both sensory-discriminative and affective-emotional components of pain experience show parallel changes. This study confirms the structural integrity of Aδ nociceptive system in idiopathic RLS, but it also suggests that RLS patients present circadian modifications in the pain system. These findings could potentially help clinicians and contribute to identify new therapeutic approaches.">

Methods:We psychophysically assessed the functionality of the inferred magnocellular (MC), parvocellular (PC), and koniocellular (KC) streams at different hierarchical loci across three clinical groups: individuals who experience migraine with aura (MA; n=13), experience migraine without aura (MWO; n=14), and Controls (n=15). Participants completed four experiments: Experiment 1 designed to assess retinal short-wavelength-sensitive (S-) cone sensitivities; Experiment 2 intended to measure postretinal temporal and spatiochromatic contrast sensitivities; Experiment 3 intended to assess postretinal spatiotemporal achromatic contrast sensitivities; and Experiment 4 designed to measure thalamocortical color discriminations along the three cone-excitation axes. Results:S-cone deficits were revealed with greater retinal areas being affected in MA compared to MWO participants. Findings across the four experiments suggest a prominent retinal locus of dysfunction in MA (lesser in MWO) with potential feedforward compensations occurring within the KC visual stream. Conclusion:Complex, integrative network compensations need to be factored in when considering the dysregulating influences of migraine along the visual pathway.">

        <span class="abst" title="Cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) is characterized by severe episodic emesis in adults and children. Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome is an increasingly recognized CVS-like illness that has been associated with chronic cannabis use. There are significant gaps in our understanding of the pathophysiology, clinical features, comorbidities, and effective management options of CVS. Recommendations for treating CVS are based on limited clinical data, as no placebo-controlled, randomized trials have yet been conducted. Diseases associated with CVS, including migraine, mitochondrial disorders, autonomic dysfunction, and psychiatric comorbidities, provide clues about pathophysiologic mechanisms and suggest potential therapies. We review our current understanding of CVS and propose future research directions with the aim of developing effective therapy. Establishing a multicenter, standardized registry of CVS patients could drive research on multiple fronts including developing CVS-specific outcome measures to broaden our understanding of clinical profiles, to serve as treatment end points in clinical trials, and to provide a platform for patient recruitment for randomized clinical trials. Such a robust database would also facilitate conduct of research that aims to determine the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms and genetic basis for CVS, as well as identifying potential biomarkers for the disorder. Soliciting government and industry support is crucial to establishing the necessary infrastructure and achieving these goals. Patient advocacy groups such as the Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome Association (CVSA), which partner with clinicians and researchers to disseminate new information, to promote ongoing interactions between patients, their families, clinicians, investigators, to support ongoing CVS research and education, must be an integral part of this endeavor.">

        <span class="abst" title="The increasing recognition of cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) in adults prompted the development of these evidence-based guidelines on the management of CVS in adults, which was sponsored by the American Neurogastroenterology and Motility Society (ANMS) and the Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome Association (CVSA). GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) framework was used and a professional librarian performed the literature search. The expert committee included the President of the CVSA who brought a patient perspective into the deliberations. The committee makes recommendations for the prophylaxis of CVS, treatment of acute attacks, diagnosis, and overall management of CVS. The committee strongly  recommends that adults with moderate-to-severe CVS receive a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA), such as amitriptyline, as a first-line prophylactic medication and receive topiramate or aprepitant as alternate prophylactic medications. Zonisamide or levetiracetam and mitochondrial supplements (Coenzyme Q10, L-carnitine, and riboflavin) are conditionally recommended as alternate prophylactic medications, either alone or concurrently with other prophylactic medications. For acute attacks, the committee conditionally recommends using serotonin antagonists, such as ondansetron, and/or triptans, such as sumatriptan or aprepitant to abort symptoms. Emergency department treatment is best achieved with the use of an individualized treatment protocol and shared with the care team (example provided). The committee recommended screening and treatment for comorbid conditions such as anxiety, depression, migraine headache, autonomic dysfunction, sleep disorders, and substance use with referral to appropriate allied health services as indicated. Techniques like meditation, relaxation, and biofeedback may be offered as complementary therapy to improve overall well-being and patient care outcomes.">

METHODS:We followed the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework and focused on interventions aimed at prophylactic management and abortive treatment of adults with CVS. Specifically, this evidence review addresses the following clinical questions: (a) Should the following pharmacologic agents be used for prophylaxis of CVS: amitriptyline, topiramate, aprepitant, zonisamide/levetiracetam, or mitochondrial supplements? (b) Should the following pharmacologic agents be used for abortive treatment: triptans or aprepitant? RESULTS:We found very low-quality evidence to support the use of the following agents for prophylactic and abortive treatment of CVS: amitriptyline, topiramate, aprepitant, zonisamide/levetiracetam, and mitochondrial supplements. We have moderate certainty of evidence for the use of triptans as abortive therapy. We found limited evidence to support the use of ondansetron and the treatment of co-morbid conditions and complementary therapies. CONCLUSIONS:This evidence review helps inform the accompanying guideline for the management of adults with CVS which is aimed at helping clinicians, patients, and policymakers, and should improve patient outcomes.">

Objective:To determine the representation of subtype-directed symptomatology in common postconcussion symptom-rating scales. Methods:Literature review and expert consensus were used to compile commonly used concussion symptom-rating scales. Statistics were generated to describe the degree of representation of the consensus symptom set. Results:The percentage of symptoms representing each subtype/associated condition is low overall (15-26%). The ocular-motor (11%) and vestibular subtypes (19%) and cervical strain (5%)-associated condition were the most under-represented and also had the greatest unmet needs. Conclusion:Concussion subtypes do not have equal representation on commonly used concussion symptom-rating scales. There is a need for a subtype-directed symptom assessment to allow for increased accuracy of diagnosis and to guide management.">

        <span class="abst" title="BACKGROUND:Concussion is a heterogeneous mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) characterized by a variety of symptoms, clinical presentations, and recovery trajectories. By thematically classifying the most common concussive clinical presentations into concussion subtypes (cognitive, ocular-motor, headache/migraine, vestibular, and anxiety/mood) and associated conditions (cervical strain and sleep disturbance), we derive useful definitions amenable to future targeted treatments. OBJECTIVE:To use evidence-based methodology to characterize the 5 concussion subtypes and 2 associated conditions and report their prevalence in acute concussion patients as compared to baseline or controls within 3 d of injury. METHODS:A multidisciplinary expert workgroup was established to define the most common concussion subtypes and their associated conditions and select clinical questions related to prevalence and recovery. A literature search was conducted from January 1, 1990 to November 1, 2017. Two experts abstracted study characteristics and results independently for each article selected for inclusion. A third expert adjudicated disagreements. Separate meta-analyses were conducted to do the following: 1) examine the prevalence of each subtype/associated condition in concussion patients using a proportion, 2) assess subtype/associated conditions in concussion compared to baseline/uninjured controls using a prevalence ratio, and 3) compare the differences in symptom scores between concussion subtypes and uninjured/baseline controls using a standardized mean difference (SMD). RESULTS:The most prevalent concussion subtypes for pediatric and adult populations were headache/migraine (0.52; 95% CI = 0.37, 0.67) and cognitive (0.40; 95% CI = 0.25, 0.55), respectively. In pediatric patients, the prevalence of the vestibular subtype was also high (0.50; 95% CI = 0.40, 0.60). Adult patients were 4.4, 2.9, and 1.7 times more likely to demonstrate cognitive, vestibular, and anxiety/mood subtypes, respectively, as compared with their controls (P &lt; .05). Children and adults with concussion showed significantly more cognitive symptoms than their respective controls (SMD = 0.66 and 0.24; P &lt; .001). Furthermore, ocular-motor in adult patients (SMD = 0.72; P &lt; .001) and vestibular symptoms in both pediatric and adult patients (SMD = 0.18 and 0.36; P &lt; .05) were significantly worse in concussion patients than in controls. CONCLUSION:Five concussion subtypes with varying prevalence within 3 d following injury are commonly seen clinically and identifiable upon systematic literature review. Sleep disturbance, a concussion-associated condition, is also common. There was insufficient information available for analysis of cervical strain. A comprehensive acute concussion assessment defines and characterizes the injury and, therefore, should incorporate evaluations of all 5 subtypes and associated conditions.">

        <span class="abst" title="In adults with X-linked hypophosphatemia (XLH), excess FGF23 impairs renal phosphate reabsorption and suppresses production of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, resulting in chronic hypophosphatemia and persistent osteomalacia. Osteomalacia is associated with poor bone quality causing atraumatic fractures, pseudofractures, delayed fracture healing, and bone pain. Burosumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody against FGF23. UX023-CL304 is an ongoing, open-label, single-arm, phase 3 study investigating the efficacy of subcutaneous burosumab, 1.0 mg/kg administered every 4 weeks, in improving osteomalacia in adults with XLH who have not been treated for at least 2 years before enrollment. The primary endpoint was improvement in osteoid volume/bone volume assessed by transiliac bone biopsies obtained at baseline and week 48. Additional assessments included serum phosphorus, markers of bone turnover, fracture/pseudofracture healing, and safety. Fourteen subjects enrolled, 13 completed 48 weeks, and 11 completed paired biopsies. All osteomalacia-related histomorphometric measures improved significantly at week 48 (mean percent change: osteoid volume/bone volume, -54%, osteoid thickness, -32%, osteoid surface/bone surface, -26%, [median] mineralization lag time, -83%). Mean serum phosphorus concentration averaged across the mid-point of the dose cycle between weeks 0 and 24 was 3.3 mg/dL, a 50% increase from 2.2 mg/dL at baseline. Markers of bone formation and resorption increased at week 48 (least squares [LS] mean increase: P1NP, +77%; CTx, +36%; both p &lt; 0.0001). All subjects had one or more treatment-emergent adverse event (AE). Most AEs were mild to moderate in severity. Two subjects experienced serious AEs (migraine; paresthesia) that were unrelated to treatment and resolved. Eleven subjects had 18 biopsy procedure-related AEs: 14 for pain, two for itch, and one each for headache and bandage irritation. No deaths or incidents of hyperphosphatemia occurred. In conclusion, by normalizing phosphate homeostasis, burosumab significantly improved osteomalacia in adults with XLH, which likely explains the improved fracture healing and amelioration of skeletal complications. © 2019 The Authors.

        <span class="abst" title="BACKGROUND:Children require anesthesia for MRI to maintain immobility and reduce discomfort; clear indications about the best anesthesiologic management are lacking and each center developed its own protocol. Moreover, children with neuropsychiatric disorders more likely require sedation and are described in literature as more prone to general and respiratory complications. Aim of this study was to analyze the applicability of a sevoflurane-based approach, to describe general and respiratory complications and to identify risk factors in a pediatric neuropsychiatric population. METHODS:Retrospective cohort study, university Hospital (January 2007-December 2016). All the 1469 anesthesiologic records of children addressed from Neuropsychiatric Unit to undergo MRI under general anesthesia were analyzed; 12 patients equal or older than 18-year-old were excluded. We identified post-hoc nine macro-categories: static encephalopathies, metabolic/evolutive encephalopathies, epileptic encephalopathies, neuromuscular diseases, autistic spectrum disorders, migraine, psychiatric disorders, intellectual disabilities, others. A logistic regression model for events with low frequency (Firth's penalized likelihood approach) was carried out to identify the mutually adjusted effect among endpoints (complications) and the independent variables chosen on the basis of statistical significance (univariate analysis, p ≤ 0.05) and clinical judgment. RESULTS:Of 1457 anesthesiologic records (age 4.0 (IQR 2.0 to 7.0) year-old, males 891 (61.2%), weight 17.0 (IQR 12.0 to 24.9) kg), 18 were cancelled for high anesthesiologic risk, 50 were cooperative, 1389 were anesthetized. A sevoflurane-based anesthesia was feasible in 92.3%; these patients required significantly less mechanical ventilation (8.6 vs. 16.2%; p = 0.012). Complications' rate was low (6.2%; 3.1% respiratory). The risk for general complications increases with ASA score &gt; 1 (OR 2.22, 95 CI% 1.30 to 3.77, p = 0.003), male sex (OR 1.73, 95% CI 1.07 to 2.81, p = 0.025), multi-drug anesthesia (OR 2.98, 95 CI% 1.26 to 7.06, p = 0.013). For respiratory complications, it increases with ASA score &gt; 1 (OR 2.34, 95 CI% 1.19 to 4.73, p = 0.017), autumn-winter (OR 2.01, 95 CI% 1.06 to 3.78, p = 0.030), neuromuscular disorders (OR 3.18, 95 CI% 1.20 to 8.41, p = 0.020). We had no major complications compromising patients' outcome or requiring admission to ICU. CONCLUSIONS:Sevoflurane anesthesia is feasible and safe for children affected by neuropsychiatric disorders undergoing MRI. Specific risk factors for general and respiratory complications should be considered.">

        <span class="abst" title="BACKGROUND:Chronic diseases in childhood can affect the physical and mental health of patients and their families. The literature on pediatric chronic diseases has found important associations between the sociodemographic variables of children and their caregivers and negative health consequences in families. METHODS:In this study, we aimed to design and validate a questionnaire on sociodemographic variables that would be useful for research on pediatric chronic diseases; and investigate the relationship between sociodemographic variables and psychosocial variables among family caregivers. First, we created a questionnaire that consists of 20 demographic, medical, and family-related items based on a literature review and expert evaluations. This questionnaire was then validated by 335 expert reviewers in the field of Social Work, who work daily with the families of patients with chronic diseases in 10 National Institutes of Health of Mexico. The validation was based on three empirical criteria created specifically for this study, and the reviewers evaluated the usefulness, relevance, and permanence of the items. In a second cross-sectional, correlational and comparative study, a total of 446 family caregivers of children with chronic diseases were interviewed, and they completed the Sociodemographic Variables Questionnaire for research on family caregivers of children with chronic sociodemographic diseases and four psychosocial measurement instruments for evaluating anxiety, depression, caregiver burden and quality of life. RESULTS:Based on the results of the first study, we created the Sociodemographic Variables Questionnaire (Q-SV) for research on family caregivers of children with chronic diseases, and it includes 17 items that assess demographic, medical, and family characteristics. The results of the second study showed that the 17 sociodemographic variables obtained in the validation by expert judges are useful for measuring and evaluating the relationship between psychosocial variables in families of children with chronic diseases. CONCLUSIONS:Psychosocial and sociodemographic factors are relevant for the development of research processes for families that care for children with chronic diseases.">

        <span class="abst" title="Background: Abdominal pain is one of the commonest symptoms in emergency departments (EDs). Diagnosis demands full attention and critical thinking, since many diseases manifest atypically and the consequences of overlooking the symptoms may be disastrous. Despite intensive diagnostic procedures, some cases remain elusive and unclear abdominal pain (UAP) is not infrequent. Emerging evidence supports the hypothesis that functional pain might be attributed to vitamin D deficiency (VDD). People with darker or covered skin are predisposed to developing VDD. Patients in Switzerland stemming from low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) are such a population. Aim: To identify cases with UAP in LMIC patients and to compare vitamin D status with a control group. Methods: A retrospective single-center case-control study was carried out from 1 January 2013 to 31 August 2016 in all adult patients (more than 16 years old) stemming from LMIC and presenting at the university ED of Bern with abdominal pain. Vitamin D status was retrieved from these cases when available. The control group consisted of patients without abdominal pain or metabolic diseases and was matched (1:1) to the cases for age, gender, body mass index, geographic distribution, and season of vitamin D estimation. Results: A total of 10,308 cases from LMIC were reported to the ED. In total, 223 cases were identified with UAP. The status of vitamin D was available for 27 patients; 27 matched individuals were subsequently retrieved for the control group. Women made up 56.7% of the UAP group and 43.3% of the control group. The most common origin of the LMIC subjects was southern Europe (20.4%), followed by southern Asia (16.7%) and Eastern Europe (13%). Fourteen UAP patients exhibited severe VDD (&lt; 25 nmol/L) versus one in the control group (p = 0.001). The difference remained significant if the patients were identified as having VDD (&lt;50 nmol/L) or not (p = 0.024). Comparison of the means indicated that the UAP group had lower vitamin D levels than the control group (41.3 vs. 53.7 nmol/L, respectively), but this difference was marginal (p = 0.060) and not statistically significant. After adjustment for potential confounders, including gender, mean vitamin D levels remained non-significantly different between groups. In the sub-group analysis, vitamin D levels were lower in women than in men (p = 0.037), compared to the respective controls. Conclusion: This study showed for the first time that patients from LMIC who presented to ED with UAP displayed VDD. Validation from larger studies is warranted to evaluate the linkage of VDD with UAP.">

        <span class="abst" title="Background: Tic disorders (TD) are common neuropsychiatric disorders among children and adolescents. It is controversial that trace elements may participate in the pathogenesis of TD. Our study aimed to investigate the trace elements status of zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), iron (Fe), and magnesium (Mg) in children with TD, in comparison to healthy controls. Methods: The medical records of eligible TD children and normal healthy children from January 1 to December 31, 2018 in the outpatient clinic were retrospectively reviewed. The clinical information of all subjects were collected including age, gender, diagnosis, previous health records, and serum trace elements level (Cu, Zn, Fe, Mg) at the time of diagnosis before initiating treatment. Results: In total, 1204 TD children (7.63 ± 2.45 years) and 1,220 healthy children (7.27 ± 3.15 years) who were divided into two gender and three age groups (2-4years, 5-9years, ≥10 years) were reviewed in our study. Our study showed that TD children generally had lower whole blood levels of Zn, Cu, Fe than the normal controls (P &lt; 0.01). No significant difference was observed in whole blood levels of Mg. After adjusting for gender, the trends still remained. Further analysis was performed according to age, the trends still remained in Zn and Fe in all age groups (P &lt; 0.05). However, we observed an almost significantly (P = 0.055) lower level of Cu in TD of 2-4 years group while significant differences in other two groups (P &lt; 0.01). Further multiple linear regression and point biserial correlation showed that the lower blood levels of Zn, Cu, and Fe were correlated with the incidence of TD. Conclusion: The present results indicated that lower blood levels of zinc, iron, copper were associated with TD. Trace elements may be used as an auxiliary treatment for TD and need to be further explored.">

Considerable progress has been made in elucidating the pathophysiological mechanisms of migraine, associated genetic factors that may influence susceptibility to the disease, and functional and anatomical changes during the progression of a migraine attack or the transformation of episodic to chronic migraine. Migraine is a life span neurological disorder that follows an evolutive age-dependent change in its prevalence and even clinical presentations. As a disorder, migraine involves recurrent intense head pain and associated unpleasant symptoms. Migraine attacks evolve over different phases with specific neural mechanisms and symptoms being involved during each phase. In some patients, migraine can be transformed into a chronic form with daily or almost daily headaches. The mechanisms behind this evolutive process remain unknown, but genetic and epigenetic factors, inflammatory processes and central sensitization may play an important role.">

However, when migraine headaches occur with CM-1, they tend to have an earlier age of onset, are more frequent and certainly more severe than when they occur without CM-1 association. The exact role or impact of CM-1 in migraine headaches has not been fully elucidated. Case Description:We report a fatal case of status migrainosus in 7 years old with CM-1 and review the literature on the possible associations. Conclusion:Migraines occurring in association with CM-1 pose a management challenge and can be potentially fatal especially if associated with autonomic symptoms. The exact pathophysiological interaction between these two conditions when they occur simultaneously needs to be further elucidated.">

        <span class="abst" title="Background:Many patients presenting with migraine also complain of constipation. The relationship between these two symptoms has not been explored yet in detail. This study, therefore, was carried out to investigate the effect of treatment of constipation with lactulose on the improvement of migraine headache in patients who referred to neurology clinics in Arak. Materials and Methods:A total of 50 patients with migraine were selected based on the Headache International Society (HIS) index and the Rome Foundation is an independent not for profit 501(c) 3 organization that provides support for activities designed to create scientific data and educational information to assist in the diagnosis and treatment of functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) (ROME III) scale so as to diagnose their migraine and constipation. The patients were randomly divided into an experimental group and a control group. A 15 cc daily of lactulose syrup was prescribed to the experimental group with the antimigraine drugs (10-mg nortriptyline and 10-mg propranonol daily). In contrast, only the standard treatment for migraine was prescribed for the control group. The severity of disability was assessed based on the severity of migraine-induced disability (MIDAS) questionnaire. Having collected the data, the data analysis was carried out using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) (IBM Corp. Released 2013. IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 21.0. Armonk, NY: IBM Corp.) statistical t-tests, and repeated measures test. Results:The results of the independent sample t-test showed no significant difference between the control and intervention group's main variables of the research before the intervention (P &lt; 0.05). On the contrary, the results of the repeated measures test indicated that the mean scores ‑of the severity of disability and the severity of migraine pain between the measurement times were significantly different for the intervention and control groups, in a way that after one and/or two months of using lactulose syrup, the severity of disability and pain in the intervention group was lower than those of the control group (P &lt; 0.001). Conclusion:Short-term follow-up of this study showed that lactulose syrup could remove the constipation with no significant side effects--can be used as an adjunct for the treatment of patients with migraine. However, future studies suggested for long-term consequences of constipation control.">

METHODS:The present work is a systematic review that was conducted according to the recommendations of the &quot;Preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis&quot;. We used Pubmed, Sciencedirect, Scopus, Clinicalkey, and Google scholar databases for the raking of the gray literature during the time frame 2009 and 2018. The protocol of the review was registered in the PROSPERO register (CRD42018115206). These studies were analyzed based on: Age, sex ratio, risk factors, etiological profile according to Trial of ORG classification 10,172 in Acute Stroke Treatment, prehospital delay average and its influential factors, thrombolyzed patients' proportion, acute and 3-month mortality and the genetic factors of ischemic stroke in Morocco. RESULTS:Twenty-nine (n = 29) studies were selected. The average age ranged from 49 ± 15.2 to 67.3 ± 9.9 years old. Moreover, we reported male predominance within all ages in 13 studies. High blood pressure, diabetes, smoking and heart disease were the four identified main risk factors by the prementioned studies. Atherosclerosis and cardioembolic were the main described etiologies of cerebral ischemia, and the average prehospital time ranged from 26 to 61.9 h. The proportion of thrombolysed patients ranged from 1.8% to 2.9%, the mortality rate varied in the acute phase from 3 to 13%, and the 3-month mortality ranged from 4.3 to 32.5%. It is also important to highlight that most of these studies, which were conducted in hospital environment, have a reduced sample size and no confidence interval. CONCLUSIONS:Ischemic stroke is affecting more likely the young population with male predominance. Moreover, the long prehospital delay and the low proportion of thrombolysed patients are alarming. This indicates the need to investigate in depth the key factors influencing the access to care for Moroccan patients in order to improve the management of this neurologic deficit in Morocco.">

        <span class="abst" title="Purpose:Children and adolescents with primary headache are at risk of persistent somatic symptoms and reduced quality of life (Qol) due to pain and pain-related behaviors, such as avoiding school and activities. Sleep is essential to health, and children and adolescents with primary headaches have more sleep complaints than do healthy controls. A treatment approach that addresses multifactorial causes is likely important. Nonpharmacological interventions seem promising. However, knowledge about effective strategies is limited. The objective of this review is to assess the effect of nonpharmacological interventions in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) among children and adolescents with primary headache in order to identify useful strategies. Patients and methods:Outcome measures are pain, sleep, Qol, and coping versus no intervention or control intervention. Medline, CINAHL, EMBASE, and PsycINFO were searched for eligible trials. ClinicalTrials.gov. was searched for ongoing trials. Initial searches yielded 2588 publications. After initial screening and subsequent full-text review and quality assessment, 13 RCTs reported in 15 articles were selected for review. All reviewers independently assessed study quality using the CONSORT criteria for nonpharmacological interventions. Results:Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), including education on pain-related topics, sleep, coping, and stress management, is an effective strategy for reducing headache and pain within groups over time. Fifteen studies assessed pain, 3 studies assessed sleep, 6 studies assessed Qol, and 11 studies assessed coping. Conclusion:Strategies identified as useful were parts of CBT interventions. However, it was not possible to identify a single effective intervention addressing pain, sleep, Qol, and coping in children and adolescents with headache, primarily because sleep was infrequently addressed. Various aspects of Qol and coping strategies were assessed, rendering comparison difficult. Strategies for future interventions should include descriptions of theory-driven CBT interventions, depending on clinical setting and based on local resources, to promote a solid evidence base for nonpharmacological interventions.">

        <span class="abst" title="BACKGROUND:Individuals with severe neurological disabilities but preserved cognition, including children, are often precluded from connecting with their environments. Brain computer interfaces (BCI) are a potential solution where advancing technologies create new clinical opportunities. We evaluated clinician awareness as a modifiable barrier to progress and identified eligible populations. METHODS:We executed a national, population-based, cross-sectional survey of physician specialists caring for persons with severe disability. An evidence- and experience-based survey had three themes: clinician BCI knowledge, eligible populations, and potential impact. A BCI knowledge index was created and scored. Canadian adult and pediatric neurologists, physiatrists and a subset of developmental pediatricians were contacted. Secure, web-based software administered the survey via email with online data collection. RESULTS:Of 922 valid emails (664 neurologists, 253 physiatrists), 137 (15%) responded. One third estimated that ≥10% of their patients had severe neurological disability with cognitive capacity. BCI knowledge scores were low with &gt; 40% identifying as less than &quot;vaguely aware&quot; and only 15% as &quot;somewhat familiar&quot; or better. Knowledge did not differ across specialties. Only 6 physicians (4%) had patients using BCI. Communication and wheelchair control rated highest for potentially improving quality of life. Most (81%) felt BCI had high potential to improve quality of life. Estimates suggested that &gt; 13,000 Canadians (36 M population) might benefit from BCI technologies. CONCLUSIONS:Despite high potential and thousands of patients who might benefit, BCI awareness among clinicians caring for disabled persons is poor. Further, functional priorities for BCI applications may differ between medical professionals and potential BCI users, perhaps reflecting that clinicians possess a less accurate understanding of the desires and needs of potential end-users. Improving knowledge and engaging both clinicians and patients could facilitate BCI program development to improve patient outcomes.">

        <span class="abst" title="Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a form of non-invasive brain stimulation that safely modulates brain excitability and has therapeutic potential for many conditions. Several studies have shown that anodal tDCS of the primary motor cortex (M1) facilitates motor learning and plasticity, but there is little information about the underlying mechanisms. Using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), it has been shown that tDCS can affect local levels of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and Glx (a measure of glutamate and glutamine combined) in adults, both of which are known to be associated with skill acquisition and plasticity; however this has yet to be studied in children and adolescents. This study examined GABA and Glx in response to conventional anodal tDCS (a-tDCS) and high definition tDCS (HD-tDCS) targeting the M1 in a pediatric population. Twenty-four typically developing, right-handed children ages 12-18 years participated in five consecutive days of tDCS intervention (sham, a-tDCS or HD-tDCS) targeting the right M1 while training in a fine motor task (Purdue Pegboard Task) with their left hand. Glx and GABA were measured before and after the protocol (at day 5 and 6 weeks) using a PRESS and GABA-edited MEGA-PRESS MRS sequence in the sensorimotor cortices. Glx measured in the left sensorimotor cortex was higher in the HD-tDCS group compared to a-tDCS and sham at 6 weeks (p = 0.001). No changes in GABA were observed in either sensorimotor cortex at any time. These results suggest that neither a-tDCS or HD-tDCS locally affect GABA and Glx in the developing brain and therefore it may demonstrate different responses in adults.">

        <span class="abst" title="Background:Oculofaciocardiodental (OFCD) syndrome is due to mutations in BCOR (BCL-6 corepressor). OFCD has phenotypic overlaps with PHACE syndrome (Posterior fossa anomalies, Hemangioma, Arterial anomalies, Cardiac defects, Eye anomalies). Infantile hemangiomas are a key diagnostic criterion for PHACE, but not for OFCD. A previous study reported two cases of infantile hemangiomas in OFCD, but the authors could not exclude chance association. Case Presentation:We describe two novel cases of female patients (one initially diagnosed with PHACE syndrome), both of whom had infantile hemangiomas. Ophthalmological findings were consistent with oculofaciocardiodental (OFCD) syndrome. Upon genetic testing, these two females were determined to have X-linked BCOR mutations confirming OFCD syndrome diagnoses. Conclusion:These case reports add support to the hypothesis that infantile hemangiomas may be a feature of OFCD. BCOR may potentially be within a pathway of genes involved in PHACE syndrome and/or in infantile hemangioma formation.">

In medicine, however, it remains a novel approach to reach out to patients. Yet, they have the potential for further improving current health care. Electronic platforms could support therapy adherence and communication between physicians and patients. The power of social media as well as other electronic devices can improve adherence as evidenced by the development of the app bant. Additionally, systemic analysis of social media content by Screenome can identify health events not always captured by regular health care. By better identifying these healthcare events we can improve our current healthcare system as we will be able to better tailor to the patients' needs. All these techniques are a valuable component of modern health care and will help us into the future of increasingly digital health care.">

        <span class="abst" title="BACKGROUND:Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy is used in the treatment of various diseases, and IVIG-related adverse effects (IVIG-AEs) vary from mild to severe. However, the mechanisms underlying IVIG-AEs and the potential predictive factors are not clear. This study investigated whether certain IVIG-AEs can be predicted before IVIG administration. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS:This retrospective cohort study at the Division of Neurology, Saitama Children's Medical Center included patients enrolled from 2008 to 2018 who were &lt; 18 years old and received IVIG for the first time. IVIG-AEs were classified according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0. RESULTS:A total of 104 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The rate of IVIG-AEs was 37.5% (39/104). The most frequent IVIG-AEs were fever (41.0% [16/39]) and headache (38.5% [15/39]). AEs were below grade 2 in all except one patient and there were no grade 4 AEs. High serum total protein (TP) level was significantly related to the occurrence of IVIG-AEs (odds ratio, 14.8; 95% confidence interval, 2.4-90.5; P &lt; 0.01). The optimal cutoff TP level was 6.7 g/dL. Although low WBC count and immunoglobulin G level may be predictive risk factors of IVIG-AEs, it was not confirmed in this study. CONCLUSION:IVIG-AEs occurred in 37.5% of cases, and most were mild. TP was the best predictive risk factor of IVIG-AEs before IVIG administration. These results may aid in elucidating the mechanism underlying IVIG-AEs.">
