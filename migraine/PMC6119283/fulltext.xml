Previous literature in pediatric populations has been conflicting and limited by small study size (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;16 to <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;45) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). One retrospective study of 41 patients with migraine reported a similar association between the T/T genotype and migraine to our results but included only 11 patients who had a TT genotype; 5 had MA and 5 MOA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Our study is therefore the first to systematically investigate the relationship in a large pediatric population.</p><p id="Par38">We performed MTHFR C677T polymorphism research for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes in our migraine patients, aiming to reduce both frequency and severity of migraine attacks by dietary supplementation with folic acid in patients with high homocysteine blood levels, based on previous literature reports in children and adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p id="Par39">The limitations of using a retrospective study meant that there is no control group of patients without headache that have MTHFR C677T genotyping. So we compared the headache patients with patients referring to our clinic for other problems not related to headache, who did the MTHFR C677T genotyping for other reasons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p id="Par40">There is also a risk of recall bias in patients and their parents&#x02019; self-reporting age of onset of headache symptoms, which may have influenced the results.</p><p id="Par41">The C677T allele of MTHFR results in low levels of circulating folate, lower availability of methionine and high concentrations of homocysteine, which would increase the risk of endothelial vascular damage mediated by oxidative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. It has been hypothesized that the resulting homocysteine-related endothelial dysfunction may be implicated in causing and perpetuating migraines. Application of the acid D, L-homocysteic, which mimics the effect of homocysteine, has been shown to increase the firing rate of trigeminal neurons responding to pain, further supporting the role of homocysteine in pain pathways and headache [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Moreover, some authors have suggested that MTHFR T/T mutations constitute a modest, but significant, genetic risk factor for ischemic stroke with conflicting results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p id="Par42">The results of our retrospective study confirm the presence of a strong positive association between MTHFR T/T polymorphism and susceptibility to MA (up to 47.9% have the T/T polymorphism), in agreement with other results reported in pediatric and adult populations. In our study we also showed a significant, though smaller, association between the T/T genotype and MOA (up to 28.8% have T/T polymorphism), as already reported in other studies in non-Caucasian pediatric and adult populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p id="Par43">We also found a negative correlation between age of onset of migraine and T/T genotype. Our results suggest that the T/T genotype is related to earlier onset of migraine in a pediatric population (8.54&#x000a0;years compared with 8.89&#x000a0;years for C/T and C/C genotype) and in particular for MA (11.73&#x000a0;years compared with 12.50 in C/T e C/C genotype). This potential association has not previously been recognized and needs further confirmatory study.</p><p id="Par44">Homocysteine levels were found to be significantly higher in patients suffering from MA (average value 7.85 &#x003bc;Mol/L) compared to patients suffering from MOA (average value 5.82&#x003bc;Mol/L). This result is in line with the comparatively higher frequencies of T/T genotype and suggests that the T/T genotype may affect homocysteine blood levels in children.</p><sec id="Sec5"><title>By contrast, the study confirms the absence of correlation</title><p id="Par45">Therefore, dietary supplementation with folic acid or a diet rich in folate to change homocysteine blood levels should be taken into consideration as an adjunct to other treatment in the long-term management of migraine and in particular in MA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par46">Clearly, mutations in MTHFR alone are not the causal factor for migraine given that it is a complex, multifaceted disorder. However, considering the relationship between the C677T variant allele and MA is important to recognize the genetic and metabolic aspects of this condition. This would facilitate early treatment initiation in order to reduce the high levels of circulating homocysteine, improve the course of migraine and reduce longer-term risk of possible complications such as ischemic stroke.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par47">Our retrospective study performed in this large pediatric cohort of migraine patients provides evidence to support that MTHFR T/T homozygosity influences susceptibility to migraine and in particular in MA.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>5,
