Epidemiological data has shown a lifetime PTH prevalence of 4.7% in men and 2.4% in women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], with migraine-like and tension-type-like headache being the most common headache phenotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In addition, a substantial number of PTH patients experience disabling comorbidities such as symptoms of depression, anxiety, and sleep disturbances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par16">In the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], PTH is defined by onset of headache within seven days following trauma or injury to the head and/or neck and is also further characterized as either acute (the first three months from headache onset) or persistent &#x02013; the latter being if the headache persists beyond 3&#x02009;months.</p><p id="Par17">Despite a very high prevalence of PTH, there are no evidence-based guidelines for acute or preventive pharmacological treatment of PTH. The likelihood of patients receiving optimal treatment is therefore low, with a high risk of unnecessary treatment exposure. Patients with very frequent or daily headache following a trauma are also at risk of developing medication-overuse headache (MOH) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p id="Par18">Current pharmacological treatments for PTH are based on acute or preventive medications used for primary headache disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], since PTH often mimics a migraine-like or tension-type headache-like phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. This approach lacks evidence and often results in poor treatment responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Furthermore, side effects to pharmacological treatment may conflict with PTH comorbidities such as depression and anxiety. Here, we review the current literature on acute and preventive treatment of PTH and provide a useful overview for clinicians. In addition, we address methodological limitations and provide recommendations for future research.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Data sources</title><p id="Par19">We searched PubMed and Embase databases for articles on acute and prophylactic pharmacological PTH treatment.

Another investigator (H.M.A) subsequently reassessed all the included articles. Final inclusion was decided by consensus between the three investigators (E.L.L, A. I and H.M.A). If consensus was not reached, one independent investigator (H.A) was available to provide advice. For each study, two investigators (E.L.L and A.I) recorded data on study design, assessment methods, inclusion criteria, exclusion criteria, age, gender, total number of subjects, headache phenotype, outcome measures and other data relevant for the scope of this review.

Fifty-seven percent of the subjects had a history of multiple concussions, while 70% had a history of headache prior to the mTBI. Ninety-three percent of the subjects reported good therapeutic effect, while the rest reported partial effect.

Some patients also received non-pharmacological treatment (e.g. physical therapy, neuropsychology) during the observational period. Subjects were allowed to use abortive medication such as NSAIDs (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;18) and triptans (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;73). Primary outcome measures were assessed by phone three months after baseline evaluation and included: 1) number of days in the previous month with a headache lasting more than 30&#x02009;min, 2) headache-related disability as determined by Migraine Disability Assessment (MIDAS) questionnaire, and 3) whether headaches were reliably relieved within 2&#x02009;h after intake of abortive medication.

In conclusion, the authors stated that topiramate could be an effective prophylactic drug&#x000a0;for PTH, while triptans appeared to be the most efficient abortive medication for&#x000a0;PTH. However, these findings would need to be validated in prospective, placebo-controlled RCTs.</p><p id="Par32">Kuczynski et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] investigated the efficacy of prophylactic PTH treatment using a retrospective chart review in 44 children (mean age: 14), who attended a brain injury clinic due to PTH. The mean time since traumatic brain injury (TBI) was 7&#x02009;months (range: 1&#x02013;29&#x02009;months) and 61% reported daily headaches. The list of prophylactic treatments used in the study included: amitriptyline (5&#x02009;mg/day to 1&#x02009;mg/kg/day), nortriptyline (dosage not specified), topiramate (12.5 to 200&#x02009;mg/day), melatonin (3&#x02013;10&#x02009;mg/day) and flunarizine (dosage not specified).

A 7-point numeric rating&#x000a0;scale from 0 to 6 (<italic>0</italic> no headache, <italic>5&#x02013;6</italic> severe headache) was used to record headache scores. In the gabapentin and amitriptyline groups, most subjects (~&#x02009;80%) were prescribed pharmacological treatment at the first or second visits (median time since mTBI: 4.3&#x02009;weeks) and inclusion was based on at least one follow-up visit after treatment initiation. Therefore, 146 subjects were excluded because they did not have follow-up measurements. The reasons for loss to follow-up were not available. For the 277 PTH patients that were included in the final analysis, the mean number of physician visits per patient was 4.1 during a mean period of 4.8&#x02009;months.

However, headache scores improved similarly in the no medication group.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par34">In conclusion, we found a lack of quality studies on both acute and preventive pharmacological treatment of PTH. Based on data reviewed from seven studies, efficacy of any pharmacological intervention could not be inferred as discussed below. The included studies used an open-label design limited by both investigator-subject interaction and placebo response. The latter varies widely across clinical trials with both acute and preventive medications for migraine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. A similar placebo effect could be expected in PTH patients. The primary and secondary endpoints varied between the included studies, making treatment comparisons unfeasible. In addition, 5 of 7 included studies included pediatric populations. In this context, it is worth noting that high placebo responses to pharmacological treatment have previously been reported in pediatric migraine patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Furthermore, the studies were also considerably underpowered with sample sizes ranging from 15 to 277 patients. In addition, the only prospective study included did not even establish baseline headache characteristics using a prospectively collected headache diary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Some of the reviewed studies included subjects with substantial within-study variance in terms of time range from TBI to intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. As an example, the preventive treatment study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] included 44 children with a mean time period since TBI of 7&#x02009;months (range: 1&#x02013;29&#x02009;months). Thus, it is highly likely that some of the subjects experienced spontaneous reduction in headache frequency during the treatment period.</p><sec id="Sec10"><title>Recommendations for future research</title><p id="Par35">Further research in acute and preventive treatment for PTH is highly warranted. Data analysis can be greatly enhanced, if consensus guidelines for controlled trials of acute and preventive treatment of PTH are provided. We suggest several aspects that should be considered to improve data consistency and study design reliability. <italic>First</italic>, future RCTs should include a double-blinded, randomized, parallel-group study design. This would enable us to prove drug efficacy and provide robust information on safety and tolerability. <italic>Second</italic>, future open-label studies and RCTs should require included subjects to fulfill the ICHD criteria for PTH to reduce population heterogeneity. A future version of the ICHD may benefit from subdividing PTH based on headache phenotype, as there could be differences in treatment outcome depending on the headache phenotype. Along this line of reasoning, detailed characterization of initial injury severity and type (i.e. GCS or computer tomography/magnetic resonance imaging classification) would also offer much needed patient stratification, which in turn could provide more targeted treatment approaches for individual patients. <italic>Third</italic>, baseline data on headache characteristics (including headache phenotype), headache &#x02018;triggers&#x02019; (i.e. physical and cognitive activity), comorbid psychiatric illness (e.g. anxiety and depression), number of TBIs, pre-trauma history of headache and other relevant data should be recorded prior to intervention. <italic>Fourth</italic>, primary and secondary endpoints should be similar among future studies. In this context, the International Headache Society (IHS) has provided guidelines for controlled trials of acute and preventive treatment of migraine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. These guidelines could serve as inspiration, which would enable us to compare efficacy of acute and preventive migraine drugs between PTH and migraine patients. <italic>Lastly</italic>, PTH patients often present with a plethora of symptoms (i.e. fatigue, depression, sleep disturbances) and not only headache [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. It would be interesting if future RCTs and high-quality open-label studies included secondary endpoints set to investigate drug efficacy on factors such as health-related quality of life, work productivity and levels of anxiety and depression.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par36">This systematic review has shown a low level of evidence to support any pharmacological treatment of PTH. High-quality RCTs and open-label studies are needed to provide robust evidence of clinical utility. Future research efforts should be driven by rigorous methodology and improved outcome assessment of analytical validity. In addition, PTH patients display a myriad of comorbid symptoms (i.e. depression, anxiety, sleep disturbances). Thus, future studies should include multidimensional outcome scales that cover multiple symptom domains. This will facilitate more targeted treatment approaches that accounts for clinical variability between patients and better reflects the concept of precision medicine.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>ED</term><def><p id="Par4">Emergency department</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GON</term><def><p id="Par5">Greater occipital nerve</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ICHD</term><def><p id="Par6">International Classification of Headache Disorders</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MIDAS</term><def><p id="Par7">Migraine Disability Assessment</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MOH</term><def><p id="Par8">Medication-overuse headache</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>mTBI</term><def><p id="Par9">Mild traumatic brain injury</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NRS</term><def><p id="Par10">Numeric rating scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NSAIDs</term><def><p id="Par11">Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PTH</term><def><p id="Par12">Post-traumatic headache</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RCTs</term><def><p id="Par13">Randomized clinical trials</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TBI</term><def><p id="Par14">Traumatic brain injury</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p>Eigil Lindekilde Larsen and H&#x000e5;kan Ashina are co-first authors.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Publisher&#x02019;s Note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn><fn><p>Sait Ashina and Henrik Winther Schytz are co-senior authors.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><p>Not applicable.</p></ack><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>All authors read and approved the final manuscript.</p></notes><notes notes-type="funding-information"><title>Funding</title><p>None.</p></notes><notes notes-type="data-availability"><title>Availability of data and materials</title><p>The datasets used in the present review are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.</p></notes><notes><title>Ethics approval and consent to participate</title><p id="Par37">Not Applicable.</p></notes><notes><title>Consent for publication</title><p id="Par38">Not Applicable.</p></notes><notes notes-type="COI-statement"><title>Competing interests</title><p id="Par39">HWS received speaking fees from Novartis and Teva.
