    "PURPOSE:Headache is a common symptom during childhood. It is usually persistent and requires special care. This study aimed to identify the characteristics of headache in children <7 years of age. METHODS:We reviewed 3 years of clinical files on children <7 years of age with a chief complaint of headache. RESULTS:This study included 146 children (66 males, 80 females; mean age, 5.5±1.0 years). Mean symptom duration was 5.8±7.9 months. Attack durations were longer than 2 hours in 31 patients, shorter than 2 hours in 70 patients, and unchecked in 45 patients. Attack frequency was 15.1±10.6 times per month. Pain locations and characteristics were also variable. Mean pain severity score was 5.1±2.2 on the visual analog scale. Of 38 patients who underwent electroencephalography, 9 showed positive findings. Of 41 who underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging, 20 showed positive findings. The diagnoses were migraine (including probable migraine) in 34, tension-type headache in 5, and congenital malformations in 3. Medications were used in 29 patients: acetaminophen in 17, ibuprofen in 8, naproxen sodium in 1, and topiramate or amitriptyline in 3. CONCLUSION:In children aged <7 years, headache has a relatively benign course, but detailed history taking is needed for more accurate diagnosis."
