  <result pre="studies. During an investigation on 48 Australian children, 200 mg/day" exact="riboflavin" post="was not effective on frequency and severity of migraine"/>
  <result pre="1). This is incongruent with our research, because we used" exact="riboflavin" post="for three months. During a trial in the Netherlands"/>
  <result pre="in the Netherlands on 6 to 13-year-old children, 50 mg/day" exact="riboflavin" post="was prescribed for four months and no significant difference"/>
  <result pre="no significant difference in mean duration, frequency and intensity between" exact="riboflavin" post="and placebo groups was found ( 13). These findings"/>

  <result pre="headache frequency in our study. Condo et al. showed that" exact="riboflavin" post="prophylaxis reduced migraine intensity and frequency, and this is"/>
  <result pre="may have influence on riboflavin’s effect, probably due to various" exact="riboflavin" post="serum levels and pharmacokinetics ( 20). These findings are"/>
  <result pre="indicate no relationship between age and sex and effect of" exact="riboflavin" post="treatment on migraine intensity and frequency. Some adult studies"/>
