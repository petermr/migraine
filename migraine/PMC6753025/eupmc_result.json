    "BACKGROUND:This study aimed to compare procedural, early and long-term outcome of device closure of atrial septal defect (ASD) between large ASD patients and very large ASD patients. METHODS:We carried a retrospective study of adult large ASD (defined as ≥25 mm) treated by percutaneous closure using Amplatzer septal occluder during 12-year period (May 2003-February 2015) at a single tertiary center. A total of 269 patients were divided into 2 groups, according to the pre-procedural maximal ASD diameter; 25 mm≤ASD<35mm, group 1 (n=216) and 35 mm≤ASD, group 2 (n=53). We compared procedural parameters, early complications and long-term follow-up results between 2 groups. RESULTS:The need of modified implantation techniques (MITs) was higher group 2 (23.6% vs. 37.7%, p=0.034). Procedural success rate was considerably high in both groups (99.1% in group 1 vs. 100% in group 2, p=0.620). Major complications were occurred in 4 (1.5%) patients (1.4% vs. 1.9%, p=0.804). Minor complication rate was not different between 2 groups. During long-term follow-up (47.2±32.0 months, range, 6.0-135.5), there was one major complication (0.4%) of stroke. Most common long-term minor event was migraine headache (3.9%) followed by arrhythmias (1.9%) without statistical difference between 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS:Although MIT was more frequently required in very large ASD groups, the procedural, early and long-term outcomes after percutaneous ASD closure were similar in both groups. This suggested that percutaneous ASD closure for very large ASD could be considered a good treatment option."
