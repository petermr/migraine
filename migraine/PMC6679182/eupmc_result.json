    "MicroRNAs (miRs) have emerged as biomarkers of migraine disease in both adults and children. In this study we evaluated the expression of hsa-miR-34a-5p and hsa-miR-375 in serum and saliva of young subjects (age 11 Â± 3.467 years) with migraine without aura (MWA), while some underwent pharmacological treatment, and healthy young subjects were used as controls. miRs were determined using the qRT-PCR method, and gene targets of hsa-miR-34a-5p and hsa-miR-375 linked to pain-migraine were found by in silico analysis. qRT-PCR revealed comparable levels of hsa-miRs in both blood and saliva. Higher expression of hsa-miR-34a-5p and hsa-miR-375 was detected in saliva of untreated MWAs compared to healthy subjects (hsa-miR-34a-5p: p < 0.05; hsa-miR-375 p < 0.01). Furthermore, in MWA treated subjects, a significant decrease of hsa-miR-34a-5p and of hsa-miR-375 was documented in saliva and blood compared to MWA untreated ones. Altogether, these findings suggested thathsa-miR-34a-5p and hsa-miR-375 are expressed equally in blood and saliva and that they could be a useful biomarker of disease and of drug efficacy in patients with MWA."
