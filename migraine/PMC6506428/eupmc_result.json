    "Purpose:To evaluate intra- and inter-observer variability and guideline adherence amongst pediatricians in treating children aged between 4 and 18 years referred with recurrent abdominal pain (RAP) without red flags. Methods:The first part of the study is a retrospective single-center cohort study. The diagnostic work-ups of eight pediatricians were compared to the national guidelines. Intra- and inter-observer variability were examined by Cramer's V test. Intra-observer variability was defined as the amount of variation within a pediatrician and inter-observer variability as the amount of variation between pediatricians in the application of diagnostic work-up in children with RAP. Prospectively, the same pediatricians were requested to provide a report on their management strategy with a fictitious case to prove similarities in retrospective diagnostic work-up. Results:A total of 10 patients per pediatrician were analyzed. Retrospectively, a (very) weak association between pediatricians' diagnostic work-ups was found (0.22), which implies high inter-observer variability. The association between intra-observer diagnostic was moderate (range, 0.35-0.46). The Cramer's V of 0.60 in diagnostic work-up between pediatricians in the fictitious case implied the presence of a moderately strong association and lower inter-observer variability than in the retrospective study. Adherence to the guideline was 66.8%. Conclusion:We found a high intra- and inter-observer variability and moderate guideline adherence in daily clinical practice amongst pediatricians in treating children with RAP in a teaching hospital."
