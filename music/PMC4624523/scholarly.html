Abstract</div> <p>Reflexology is basically a study of how one part of the human body relates to another part of the body. Reflexology practitioners rely on the reflexes map of the feet and hands to all the internal organs and other human body parts. They believe that by applying the appropriate pressure and massage certain spots on the feet and hands, all other body parts could be energized and rejuvenated. This review aimed to revisit the concept of reflexology and examine its effectiveness, practices, and the training for reflexology practitioners. PubMed, SCOPUS, Google Scholar, and SpringerLink databases were utilized to search the following medical subject headings or keywords: foot massage, reflexology, foot reflexotherapy, reflexological treatment, and zone therapy. The articles published for the last 10 years were included. Previous systematic reviews failed to show concrete evidence for any specific effect of reflexology in any conditions. Due to its non-invasive, non-pharmacological complementary nature, reflexology is widely accepted and anecdotal evidence of positive effect reflexology in a variety of health conditions are available. Adequate training for practitioners is necessary to ensure the consistency of service provided. </p> </div> <div class="abstract" title="abstract"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

Introduction</div> <p>Reflexology is a systematic practice in which applying some pressure to any particular points on the feet and hands give impacts on the health of related parts of the body. <a href="#bib1"> <sup>1</sup> </a> Each point of the pressure acts as the sensors on the feet and hands and is links with different parts of body specifically. <a href="#bib1"> <sup>1</sup> </a> These sensors will be stimulated by applying the reflexology technique in order to improve the blood and energy circulation, give sense of relaxation, and maintain the homoeostasis. <a href="#bib2"> <sup>2</sup> </a> Reflexology session can be improved by other elements such as aromatherapy, peaceful music, and good environment settings. <a href="#bib3"> <sup>3</sup> </a> There is a term in reflexology called reflex zone therapy. Reflex zone therapy is where the body is divided into ten longitudinal zones from head to toe. In the reflex zone therapy, there are five zones on both sides of the body in which each zone diverge down the particular arm, and also continue straight down the body and down the particular leg to line up with a toe on the respective foot. Practitioners usually choose the suitable technique to be applied to the reflex zone therapy to gain optimized efficiency and impact. Reflexology is a complementary therapy instead of an alternative therapy to other treatments which patient already has based on reflexology maps. <a href="#bib2"> <sup>2</sup> </a> Complementary therapies nowadays are applied in many of palliative care or to alleviate a problem without dealing with the underlying cause in order to make patient's emotional, physiological, and spiritual health improve and increase the value of their life. <a href="#bib4"> <sup>4</sup> </a> Two methods of reflexology that have been accepted internationally are Ingham method and Rwo Shur method. The first method does not use any tools in its practice and the second method utilizes the use of tools such as a wooden stick. <a href="#bib2"> <sup>2</sup> </a> There are five theories that support how reflexology gives impacts to body health. <a href="#bib5"> <sup>5</sup> </a> First and second basic theories are related to energy. Energy theory advocates that body parts can communicate using electromagnetic fields and the communication can be blocked based on the surrounding respectively. <a href="#bib6"> <sup>6</sup> </a> Third and fourth theories indicate that energy flow can be restored and the fourth is about the pathway which is blocked can be opened. <a href="#bib7"> <sup>7</sup> </a> The last theory proposes that reflexology can break up the lactic acid crystal that usually deposited in the feet and allow energy to flow efficiently. <a href="#bib5"> <sup>5</sup> </a> </p> <p>Modern reflexology technique has been used since 60 years ago and now more scientific and clinical research have been conducted because of their positive effects in reducing and alleviating the symptoms associated with certain diseases. Reflexology gives benefits to certain groups of people and generally does not cause any harmful effects as long as certain precautions are taken by the patients with certain medical circumstances. Each person has a different body system condition, so results from reflexology treatment could differ from one person to another. <a href="#bib8"> <sup>8</sup> </a> Based on latest research conducted, reflexology seems to be effective in helping the body systems to return to its natural state. <a href="#bib1"> <sup>1</sup> </a> One of the most significant current discussions in reflexology is its effectiveness in tackling several symptoms of diseases. <a href="#bib1"> <sup>1</sup> </a> The level of disease conditions and pain are reduced as the patients receive reflexology treatment. It has been suggested by a Swiss study that patients who have undergone reflexology sessions showed a significant decrease in the amount of medication needed. <a href="#bib1"> <sup>1</sup> </a> As a complementary therapy, reflexology seems to work better with conventional treatment to treat certain diseases. <a href="#bib8"> <sup>8</sup> </a> The most significant current discussions in reflexology practice are related to the aspect of health, safety, and hygiene. Other than that, the principles and practice of reflexology as a complementary therapy is important to make sure the application of this therapy is reliable. </p> </div> <div class="historyofreflexology" title="sec"> <span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">2</span> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
History of reflexology</div> <p>Earliest discovery of reflexology was found in Egypt based on the observation of daily life activities including the medical practices. <a href="#bib1"> <sup>1</sup> </a> Other studies have reported that reflexology emerges from China for the last 5000 years ago but there is no documentation found, so with the finding of hieroglyphic mural in the pyramid located in Saggara, reflexology is considered as a part of Egyptian culture from 2330 BC. <a href="#bib3"> <sup>3</sup> </a> At the late of 14th century, reflexology was already applied throughout the Europe with another name; zone therapy. <a href="#bib9"> <sup>9</sup> </a> Father of modern reflexology, Dr. William Fitzgerald (1872–1942) has discovered that zone therapy has been used by Aboriginal American. <a href="#bib9"> <sup>9</sup> </a> Jenny Wallace from North American Indians tribes used pressure at the feet as one of the sources of healing process. <a href="#bib9"> <sup>9</sup> </a> Fitzgerald study has brought reflexology practice to be widely used in the United States. <a href="#bib3"> <sup>3</sup> </a> The discovery of zone therapy was developed from the finding of pressure applied on many parts of body such as hands, nose, ears, and many more can relieve pain sensation. <a href="#bib10"> <sup>10</sup> </a> Dr. Joe Shelby Riley from Washington has conducted many studies of therapy including reflexology and has used this therapy for many years. <a href="#bib9"> <sup>9</sup> </a> Eunice Ingham (1879–1974) has worked together with Dr. Riley in 1930's as the therapist and work greatly to help people understand reflexology. <a href="#bib8"> <sup>8</sup> </a> She shared the technique of reflexology with others by writing many books such as "Stories the Feet Can Tell, Stories the Feet Have Told, and Stories the Feet Are Telling". <a href="#bib9"> <sup>9</sup> </a> Reflexology has greater recognition after the emergence of another eminent woman in this therapy world with her book; "Helping Yourself with Foot Reflexology" which reached more than 500,000 copies sold. <a href="#bib9"> <sup>9</sup> </a> </p> </div> <div class="benefitsofreflexology" title="sec"> <span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">3</span> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Benefits of reflexology</div> <p>Reflexology has been chosen by most people to treat their body health problems because it offers high level of safety and effectiveness. It also offers natural treatment without consuming drugs and it is easy to use. <a href="#bib1"> <sup>1</sup> </a> Learning reflexology and its application is quite easy, there is no limitation for people to apply it anytime and anywhere. <a href="#bib1"> <sup>1</sup> </a> Its effectiveness in treating the root of some diseases may lead to many benefits in health concern such as it helps in easing day-to-day stresses and alleviates the effects from injury and illness. <a href="#bib1"> <sup>1</sup> </a> However, it is not used in diagnosing processes. <a href="#bib11"> <sup>11</sup> </a> </p> <p>Stress contributes up to 80% for the development of any illness.

Maps of reflexology</div> <p>Different maps representing the body reflex areas on the palms and feet are presented in this section. </p> <p>A series of banded reflex area on the top of the left hand represents the left hand side of the body from the top left side of the head to the knee. Specifically, reflex area for lymph glands, groin, and fallopian tubes encircled the wrist <a href="#bib1"> <sup>1</sup> </a> ( <a href="#fig1">Fig. 1</a>). </p> <p>This reflex area represents the right side of the body. There is an invisible point at the base of the hand's long bones which is called as waistline. <a href="#bib1"> <sup>1</sup> </a> This line divided the hand into two parts. The upper back reflex area lies on the above of the line whereas lower back, hips, and internal organs located below it <a href="#bib1"> <sup>1</sup> </a> ( <a href="#fig2">Fig. 2</a>). </p> <p>This reflex area is related to the left side of the body.

This makes each reflex area is specifically for certain organs. This reflex area represents the right side of the body. For example, the reflex area for liver is only available on the right side of the palm <a href="#bib1"> <sup>1</sup> </a> ( <a href="#fig4">Fig. 4</a>). </p> <p>The reflex area of spine lies on the inside part of the top left foot whereas shoulders on the outside. <a href="#bib1"> <sup>1</sup> </a> Lung, chest, breast, and upper back assemble in one reflex area <a href="#bib1"> <sup>1</sup> </a> ( <a href="#fig5">Fig. 5</a>). </p> <p>This reflex area relates to the right side of the body including arm and leg.

Reflex zone therapy</div> <p>Reflex zone is the region in the zone therapy that illustrates its interconnection with the whole parts of the body. Pressure applied to this region will help specific organ or particular part to alleviate the pain and symptoms of a disease.

Challenges and limitation of research and the practice of reflexology</div> <p>The literature on reflexology is only beginning to emerge since early 1990. Several methodological shortcomings in the previous studies of reflexology safety and efficacy are worth mentioning. Firstly, the number and the methods of reflexology treatment given are not standardized. Furthermore, most studies have small sample size (around 20 participants). </p> <p>The recently increased demand for evidence-based practice challenges the researchers to provide a relevant but holistic assessment of reflexology. Despite the recent vast use of reflexology, minimal attention has been given to the ethical issues related to the research on reflexology. In the view of public health and safety, we argue that the research on reflexology should adhere to the same ethical requirements for all clinical research. </p> <p>The proper design, control, and intervention protocols of research on reflexology remain debatable. The use of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) is the golden standard in assessing the efficacy of complementary therapies such as reflexology. <a href="#bib34"> <sup>34</sup> </a> Verhoef et al. have described the challenges when researching complementary therapies: standardization of regimented treatment that limit the individualization of treatment; client's focus on health with restricted roles for disease treatment; ethical issues involving the recruitment and randomization due to participants pre-conceived belief on reflexology; practicality of applying sham reflexology; interference of psychological influence on rapport between patient-provider. <a href="#bib35"> <sup>35</sup> </a> </p> </div> <div class="recommendationforfutureresearch" title="sec"> <span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">13</span> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Recommendation for future research</div> <p>RCTs have a vital role in the assessment of efficacy in reflexology. However, they only address the effect of reflexology in which other pertinent issues are unexplored such as the mechanism of reflexology, psyche, and the experience of participants receiving reflexology. Nursing research has long used qualitative research to explore various health care phenomena. Similarly, qualitative approach can provide further understanding about the patient's perception and belief towards reflexology. <a href="#bib4">4</a>, <a href="#bib36">36</a> Qualitative research also assists in understanding the impact of the context and the process of reflexology intervention. A greater understanding of reflexology intervention has the potential to enhance the delivery of health care. Thus, it is argued that qualitative explorative methods combined with RCTs could potentially reveal the contributing factors of reflexology effect. </p> </div> <div class="proposedpractice" title="sec"> <span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">14</span> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Proposed practice</div> <p>Reflexology practice should be implemented as a complementary therapy in developed countries due to its functions which can give many benefits to body health condition. Recent lifestyles cause the body to adapt to so many stressful effects. With the basic of reflexology which can be done by ourselves, it helps to improve the performance in our life day by day. </p> <p>In Malaysia, reflexology has been applied widely but without any certification and qualification from the Ministry of Health. Tighter control is needed to overcome this problem. Practitioners who conduct this therapy may not have the accurate knowledge about reflexology and may lead to any contraindication for certain conditions. The government should take serious enforcement about this practice among practitioners who are not certified. Each practitioner must have a proper training. The ministry of education could provide vocational training in the local community colleges throughout Malaysia to upgrade the skills and knowledge of reflexology practitioners. </p> <p>Changes should be implemented immediately instead of in stages, so that patients can go to any reflexology centre without any doubt. The entire centres, spas or even small booth that offer reflexology treatment must obtain a certificate from the Ministry of Health. It is suggested that each centre to have a medical form about patient's details, medical history, and screening form. It is already issued by the Ministry of Health but none of the centres has ever applied. </p> <p>To make sure all people are aware of this problems and benefits of reflexology, the Ministry of Health should organize awareness programs such as talks, offers class for reflexology practitioners with low fees, and campaign about the importance of having correct reflexology technique with recognized premises. A reflexology practitioner association is yet to be formed. Any case of problems happen related to reflexology in this country can be referred to this organization. </p> </div> <div class="conclusions" title="sec"> <span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">15</span> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Conclusions</div> <p>Reflexology practitioners and the professional association have advocated that reflexology is effective for general well-being maintenance and treatment of chronic diseases such as strokes, musculoskeletal disorders, and stress. Due to its soothing massage and non-drug complementary nature, reflexology is widely accepted by general public. Yet, numerous systematic reviews confirmed that strong evidence of the positive effects of reflexology postintervention are lacking despite plenty reported small-scale trial and anecdotal evidence of reflexology for some common ailments. Adequate training of practitioners and reflexology programme accreditation are to ensure correct and consistent services are provided. </p> </div> <div class="conflictofinterests" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
