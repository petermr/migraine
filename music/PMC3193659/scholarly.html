INTRODUCTION</div> <p>Stress is a major factor behind many health-related problems. Stress is defined as a condition characterized by symptoms of physical and mental strain or tension, which can result from a reaction to a situation in which person feels threatened, pressured, etc.[ <a href="#ref1">1</a>] Reasons for stress can be physical (injury or illness) or mental (problems in marriage, job, health, or fitness). Bjorntop's hypothesis[ <a href="#ref2">2</a>] postulates that psychosocial stress triggers the onset of visceral obesity, insulin resistance, and dyslipidemia. Globalization and technological innovations are bringing about new challenges to the study of mental health and stress management. </p> <p>India is currently experiencing a rapid epidemiological transition from communicable to noncommunicable diseases. Rapid industrialization and urbanization with subsequent rise in standard of living, obesity, stress, sedentary lifestyle, addictions, etc., are posing a growing concern to the health of the nation in terms of diseases like obesity, diabetes, hypertension, development of restrictive lung functions, and cardiovascular morbidities.[ <a href="#ref3">3</a>] </p> <p>Urbanization is the major factor responsible for the rise in the prevalence of hypertension and diabetes.[ <a href="#ref4">4</a>â€“ <a href="#ref6">6</a>] Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) in developing countries are expected to increase almost twice than in the developed countries[ <a href="#ref7">7</a>] and diabetes in India is expected to rise to 69.9 million by 2025, unless urgent preventive steps are taken.[ <a href="#ref8">8</a>] In India, almost 2.6 million individuals are predicted to die due to coronary heart disease[ <a href="#ref9">9</a>] and there would be 111% increase in cardiovascular deaths in India by 2020.[ <a href="#ref4">4</a>] This rising trend is explained as consequences of urbanization, such as change in lifestyle pattern, diet, and stress. Furthermore, it is the imbalance between rise in the population, technological advancement, and decreased job opportunities which lead to stress and hypertension in young people.[ <a href="#ref10">10</a>] NHIS report revealed that 43% persons were practicing Complementary and Alternative Medicines (CAM) including prayer, 7.6% meditation, and 5.1% yoga in USA.[ <a href="#ref11">11</a>] No details are available regarding the prevalence of different stress relaxation practices (SRPs) in India. There is no such study conducted on SRPs. People of Gujarat are prone to develop stress and related disorders like hypertension, diabetes, etc., because of genetic susceptibility, sedentary lifestyle, urbanization, and industrialization. </p> <p>Relaxation and cognitive behavioral skills are helpful, cost-effective, and beneficial group methods than individual counseling. It is important scientifically, practically, and financially to promote stress management programs for the betterment of people.[ <a href="#ref12">12</a>] The role of religious practices, meditation, yoga, herbal and ayurvedic therapies in the modulation of coronary risk factors such as smoking cessation, weight control, hypertension, dyslipidemias, diabetes, endothelial dysfunction, and stress has been evaluated.[ <a href="#ref13">13</a>] The practice of yoga, a traditional Indian system, is now gaining international acceptance for stress-coping skills. Yoga helps therapeutically (in asthma, cardiac patients, multiple sclerosis, migraine, rheumatoid arthritis, and rehabilitation) and promotes physical and mental health.[ <a href="#ref14">14</a>] Repeated practice of different techniques related to SRPs will increase physical and psychological comfort and at the same time create conditional relaxation responses in the nervous system.[ <a href="#ref15">15</a>] </p> <p>Because of the increasing burden of the lifestyle diseases and potential to prevent them with stress relaxation, efforts are required for promotion of stress relaxation programs. The present study was taken up to know the pattern of SRPs and characteristics of the users and to find out its importance in prevention of chronic diseases. </p> <div class="aimsandobjectives" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Aims and Objectives</div> <p>The present study was carried out to study the prevalence of different types of SRPs in the study population and their sociodemographic profile. </p> </div> </div> <div class="materials_methods" title="materials|methods"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
MATERIALS AND METHODS</div> <p>A cross-sectional community-based study was carried out by house-to-house survey in municipal corporation (AMC) areas of Ahmedabad city. This study was done along with an epidemiological study of diabetes in urban areas of Ahmedabad. Sample size for the diabetes survey was 900 (assuming 10% prevalence and 20% allowable error in n = 4PQ/L2). So, the data for the SRPs were collected from all the respondents of the diabetes research. AMC has six zones, namely, south, north, central, east, west, and new west, covering population of around 3.5 million and which is expected to double by 2011.[ <a href="#ref16">16</a>] Each zone is divided into 9 to 11 wards. Sample was stratified proportionately in each zone depending on the population of the respective zone. So, the numbers of people to be selected from each zone were 157 from south, 166 from north, 116 from central, 170 from east, 135 from west, and 156 from new west zone. After the stratification, one ward was randomly selected from each zone, and from each of the selected ward, one area was randomly selected for the survey. All people above 20 years of age, in the visited houses from the selected area of each ward, were included in the study until the desired sample size of that particular zone was reached. Clearance from institutional ethical committee was taken. Study was carried out during May, 2007 to July, 2008. Initially, a pilot study was carried out and preliminary analysis was done to reformat the questionnaire and to prepare the final proforma. House-to-house visit was carried out in the defined area. Signed informed consent was taken from all participants. Information was collected in a predesigned and pretested proforma [ <a href="#T1">Table 1</a>] from each respondent in detail regarding sociodemographic parameters, history of diabetes and hypertension, and the frequency and pattern of SRPs. We had asked for SRPs like yoga, pranayama, meditation, stretching exercise, raiky, and religious practices like mantra chanting, dhyana, prayer, spiritual book reading, rituals, listening to music, etc. </p> <div class="table-wrap_UNKNOWN" id="T1" position="float"> <span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Table 1</span>  <p>Proforma in tabular form</p>  <div class="graphic_UNKNOWN" /> </div> <p>Socioeconomic status (SES) was calculated by modified Prasad's classification.[ <a href="#ref17">17</a> <a href="#ref18">18</a>] All people of more than 20 years of age in the visited houses and who had given written informed consent were covered in the survey. After the completion of interview, people were educated about the importance of adopting the healthy lifestyle and other health promotional measures for the importance of SRPs. Total three visits were conducted to increase overall response rate. </p> <div class="dataanalysis" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Data analysis</div> <p>Data were collected, compiled, and analyzed in Excel sheet. Categorical variables were analyzed with Chi-square, while qualitative data were analyzed with the help of Z test. We analyzed data with SPSS17 demo version for comparison of sociodemographic characteristics of the two groups, i.e., those doing SRPs and those not doing SRPs. We identified independent factors associated with SRPs using univariate linear regression analysis.

DISCUSSION</div> <p>Present study was intended to find out the prevalence and pattern of SRPs among â‰¥20 years of age population. </p> <p>Prevalence of SRPs (including all patterns) in the current study was 310 (34.3%), of which majority (243, 78.4%) was practicing religious activities like mantra, dhyana, prayer, spiritual book reading, rituals, hearing music, etc., and 36 (11.6%) were practicing yoga. Study showed increasing trend of doing SRPs among people â‰¥40 years of age. Mean age of people who were doing and not doing SRPs was 49.32 Â± 15.8 and 41.62 Â± 15.2, respectively. Younger persons are more reluctant to SRPs and it might be due to the effect of urbanization and westernization. The persons who were practicing stress relaxation practicing were mostly females (58.4%), had college-level education (30.3%), had sedentary occupation (93.9%), married (79.4%), belonged to higher SES (70.6%), and had residential location in new west and central zones. </p> <p>We found that more women were practicing SRPs than males. This might be due to religious inclination of women of Gujarat toward religious activities compared with males and also social factors like most of them were housewives, who had more time after retirement and had completed their family responsibilities such as the marriage of their sons and daughters and so could spend more time in religious activities. Maximum numbers of subjects, who were practicing SRPs, were from new west and central zone of the city. The central zone which is the old part of the city (walled city) seems to have residents who have preserved their traditional customs and rituals and hence are involved in religious activities in their daily practice. The new west zone is the new extension of Ahmedabad which has residents who have more westernized lifestyle and there seems to be more awareness about the modern techniques of SRPs such as yoga, meditation, and stretching exercises along with religious activities. We found that persons with SRPs were less likely to have diabetes and hypertension compared with the persons without SRPs. Similarly, Oexmann <i>et al</i>.[ <a href="#ref19">19</a>] reported results on a church-based intervention in cardiovascular risk reduction in Christian communities in North and South Carolina in the USA. Richard <i>et al</i>.[ <a href="#ref20">20</a>] found that stress management gives clinically significant benefit to patients with type 2 diabetes. </p> <div class="comparisons" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Comparisons</div> <p>Our findings are similar to the study conducted by Birdee <i>et al</i>. in USA.[ <a href="#ref21">21</a>] They showed that yoga users were more likely to belong to younger age groups, female gender, graduates, and belong to higher class and western region, and were less likely to have hypertension. Similar findings were also revealed by Saper <i>et al</i>.[ <a href="#ref22">22</a>] in the nationally representative sample, USA. Methodology differs that they had taken CAM and Yoga users and we have included all types of SRPs, but not other types of CAM. Chaya <i>et al</i>. found that long-term yoga practice (for 1 year or more) is associated with increased insulin sensitivity and attenuates the negative relationship between body weight or waist circumference and insulin sensitivity.[ <a href="#ref23">23</a>] </p> <p>Report prepared by Patricia <i>et al</i>.[ <a href="#ref11">11</a>] found that 43% persons were practicing CAM including prayer, 7.6% meditation, and 5.1% yoga. Other studies done by Bishop and Lewith[ <a href="#ref24">24</a>] and MacLennan <i>et al</i>.[ <a href="#ref25">25</a>] showed similar findings. They found CAM practice users were more likely to be females, older adults, college educated, positive correlation with age and higher status, but they had focused on CAM use. </p> <p>There are very few studies which covered all the types of stress relaxation techniques, as most of the studies are done on CAM users and randomized control trials on efficacy of yoga. We have included yoga, meditation, religious activities, etc., but not other types of CAM. Yoga and pranayama have ancient origin in India, but younger population are less familiar with them and their importance in prevention of health problems, so they are less likely to practice SRPs. </p> </div> </div> <div class="conclusion" title="conclusion"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
CONCLUSION</div> <p>In the present study, people with SRPs are more likely to be above 40 years of age, females, having college education, indulging in sedentary occupation, belonging to upper-middle SES, married, and more likely to residing in new west and central zones. Diabetes, hypertension, and other chronic lifestyle-related disorders can be prevented by SRPs. Policy makers should take SRPs seriously in prevention and treatment of many health problems as it is cost-effective strategy with its ancient roots, so community acceptance would be easily perceived. Health education and other promotional programs should be planned to make the community, especially the younger generation, well versed with SRPs and its importance for primordial and primary prevention of many currently prevalent diseases in our society. </p> <p>There are limitations to our study. Respondents self reported the information and so data may be subject to recall bias. SRP users were defined as whether they are doing SRPs or not, but not included the duration of it. We identified differences in SRPs among individuals based on demographic characteristics, but as this is cross-sectional study, we cannot identify causal relationship between characteristics and SRPs. </p> </div> <div class="suggestionsforfutureresearch" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
SUGGESTIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH</div> <p>Majority of researches are conducted in the USA; so, further research should be conducted in other country including India as yoga and meditation have their ancient roots in India. Future researches should be planned to find out the population who are more likely to get benefit of SRPs and health problems that can be prevented or treated with SRPs. </p> </div> <div class="recommendations" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
RECOMMENDATIONS</div> <p>The health education and Behavior Change Communication (BCC) campaign should be planned to make them more health conscious and importance of SRPs in this challenging world of globalization and industrialization. </p> </div> </div> <div class="back" title="back"> <div class="ack" title="ack"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
