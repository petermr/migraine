    "\"Kate\" is a thin, attractive 50-year-old perimenopausal woman who considers herself \"basically healthy\" but feels she needs help with stress management in her life. She is educated, married, and the mother of 4 children ranging in age from 11 to 22 years. In addition to managing her household, she has a full-time job as an administrative assistant and also works a part-time job from home. She states she needs to do this so the family can \"get back on our feet\" as her husband was unemployed for a number of months and they currently have 2 children in college. In addition, they relocated a year ago to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, for her husband's job and now have a higher mortgage payment. \"Family\" is Kate's top priority, but she does not receive much assistance from her husband on the home front and feels \"there is not enough time in a day.\""
