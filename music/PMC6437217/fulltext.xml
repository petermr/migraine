Responses to 832 online survey-based phenotypes including diseases, medications, and environmental exposures were analyzed in 23andMe research participants. For each phenotype, survey respondents were used to construct a cohort of Parkinson&#x02019;s disease cases and age-matched and sex-matched controls, and an association test was performed using logistic regression. Cohorts included a median of 3899 Parkinson&#x02019;s disease cases and 49,808 controls, all of European ancestry. Highly correlated phenotypes were removed and the novelty of each significant association was systematically assessed (assigned to one of four categories: known, likely, unclear, or novel). Parkinson&#x02019;s disease diagnosis was associated with 122 phenotypes. We replicated 27 known associations and found 23 associations with a strong a priori link to a known association. We discovered 42 associations that have not previously been reported. Migraine, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and seasonal allergies were associated with Parkinson&#x02019;s disease and tend to occur decades before the typical age of diagnosis for Parkinson&#x02019;s disease. The phenotypes that currently comprise the Parkinson&#x02019;s disease phenome have mostly been explored in relatively small purpose-built studies. Using a single large dataset, we have successfully reproduced many of these established associations and have extended the Parkinson&#x02019;s disease phenome by discovering novel associations. Our work paves the way for studies of these associated phenotypes that explore shared molecular mechanisms with Parkinson&#x02019;s disease, infer causal relationships, and improve our ability to identify individuals at high-risk of Parkinson&#x02019;s disease.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/100000864</institution-id><institution>Michael J.

Some associations represent known consequences of PD symptoms (e.g., trouble walking, more frequent physician visits), known consequences of PD treatment (e.g., having had brain surgery, daytime sleepiness due to dopaminergic medication<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>), or plausible consequences of later-stage PD (e.g., flossing less frequently, less able to clap to a beat). Other associated phenotypes are used in the International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society research criteria for prodromal Parkinson&#x02019;s disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> (e.g., REM sleep behavior disorder, olfactory loss). We also identified associations where the underlying causal relationship is unknown. We have organized PD-associated traits into functionally related groups and discuss some of the main findings here.</p><p id="Par9">Several neurological disorders were associated with PD including restless leg syndrome (RLS), migraine, and epilepsy. RLS is more prevalent in people with PD, although previous prevalence estimates have ranged widely and it is unclear whether RLS is a risk factor for PD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup></p><p id="Par10">We observed that migraine was positively associated with PD. Only two cohort studies have previously been conducted, but both found that midlife migraine was associated with increased risk of PD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> Both studies corrected for head trauma and cardiovascular risk factors and disease since they are risk factors for secondary parkinsonism. We found that most cardiovascular variables were negatively associated with PD (e.g., high cholesterol, BMI, tobacco use, type 2 diabetes) with the exception of angina and chest pain during exercise. We found that the association between PD and migraine remained significant (OR&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.756 [1.554&#x02013;1.985], <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.93&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>&#x02212;19</sup>) after correcting for head injury, angina, and chest pain during exercise using dummy variable imputation. Since the average age of onset is typically much earlier for migraine than for PD, migraine may be a novel PD risk factor.</p><p id="Par11">People with PD were more likely to self-report having been diagnosed with, or treated for, epilepsy or seizures. A recent British study found a significantly greater incidence rate ratio of epilepsy in 23,086 PD cases and 92,343 matched controls, suggesting that PD may be a risk factor for epilepsy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup></p><p id="Par12">Psychiatric manifestations are common in PD. Questions pertaining to depression and anxiety have been incorporated into the MDS-UPDRS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup> and psychosis has been found in up to 60% of PD patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> There has been substantial interest in a connection between obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and PD since both can be treated via deep brain stimulation, can be caused by viral encephalitis, and may involve dysfunction of the basal ganglia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> Kummer and Teixeira<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> reviewed 11 studies of OCD and OCD symptoms (OCS) in relation to PD and found several methodological issues including small sample sizes (20&#x02013;124 PD cases) leading to a lack of statistical power. Indeed, four of the five case-control studies assessed yielded non-significant results. With 10,437 PD cases in this particular regression, our study was well-powered to detect a positive association between PD and OCD (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;2.34&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>&#x02212;15</sup>).</p><p id="Par13">People with PD tended to report being less quick to anger, less outspoken, and less talkative. Our results are qualitatively similar to previous observations, which have found that people with PD tended to be less aggressive,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> more inhibited,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> and more neurotic and introverted.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> Whether these personality differences exist prior to PD diagnosis is controversial and may be due to recall bias.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup></p><p id="Par14">People with PD were more likely to report a preference for, and increased consumption of, sweet foods and beverages. There have been few consistent associations between PD and the intake of specific food items with the exception of coffee<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> and perhaps dairy products.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> However, a recent Italian study found a greater intake of sweets in 600 people with PD compared to 600 age-matched and sex-matched controls.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> A German case&#x02013;control study including 342 people with PD reported a greater intake of sweets, cookies, and cakes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> This was associated with time since diagnosis, suggesting that altered food preferences may be a feature of later stage PD.</p><p id="Par15">Being married was associated with an increased odds of PD. Compared to people who reported never having been married and after adjusting for covariates including age, the odds of PD were: (1) highest in people who were currently married (OR&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.793 [1.609&#x02013;1.999], <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;5.04&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>&#x02212;26</sup>), (2) attenuated in people who were divorced (OR&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.268 [1.108&#x02013;1.450], <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;<italic>=</italic>&#x02009;5.40&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup>), and (3) abrogated in people who were widowed (OR&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.029 [0.852&#x02013;1.241], <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.771). We ran a phenome analysis with marital status as the outcome variable and found that marriage was largely negatively associated with a wide variety of diseases, with PD being a notable exception (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). This remained true when analyzing females and males separately. These results suggest that the association with PD was unlikely to be due to bias from over-reporting of disease history in married individuals, but we cannot completely rule out the possibility that prodromal features of PD like REM sleep behavior disorder may lead spouses to encourage their partners to seek medical consultation.</p><p id="Par16">We found that seasonal allergies were associated with PD. Although the immune system is known to play an important role in PD,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> to our knowledge only two studies of PD and allergies have been published. A retrospective case-control study found that PD was positively associated with allergic rhinitis, but not asthma or hayfever.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> A study using the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database found a positive, but not significant, association between PD and allergic rhinitis (hazard ratio&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.29 [0.97&#x02013;1.72]).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> We found that PD was also associated with allergies to plants and antibiotics, but not with allergies to food or animals (Supplementary Data <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Understanding the biological differences between these different groups of allergies may allow us to hone in on specific immunological pathways that contribute to PD risk. Seasonal allergies typically develop early in life, but further research is needed to determine whether having seasonal allergies is a risk factor for PD. If so, it may be possible to manipulate risk using immune-modulating drugs.</p><p id="Par17">Now that we have identified phenotypes that are correlated with PD it is also possible to test whether these phenotypes are causes or consequences of the disease. Longitudinal prospective cohort studies are often used to perform causal inference, but this approach may be less appropriate in PD since neurodegeneration may begin as long as 20 years before PD diagnosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup> Alternatively, Mendelian randomization is a causal inference method that utilizes data from genome-wide association studies (GWASes) and is not hampered by the lengthy prodromal phase of PD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> We have collected genetic data for all individuals used in this study and will be able to explore causal inference in future work.</p><p id="Par18">Even in the absence of a known causal relationship, phenotypes that are correlated with PD can be used to predict PD as long as the phenotype is enriched in PD cases prior to diagnosis. In many cases, modern machine learning algorithms have been remarkably successful in taking a large set of predictors (e.g., phenotypes)&#x02014;each weakly associated with the outcome (e.g., PD)&#x02014;and combining them into a single, strong predictive model.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> Indeed, several algorithms have been developed to predict the risk of developing PD using data derived from clinical tests, olfaction tests, genotyping arrays, and online tests and surveys.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup> Models based on data from online surveys or electronic health records can be used for low-cost population-wide screening, and may be a valuable tool for prioritizing individuals with a high probability of developing PD for research purposes. Identifying high-risk individuals may also be critically important for the development of effective disease modifying therapies for PD. Because a large proportion of the dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra have already died by the time PD is typically diagnosed,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup> it may already be too late to intervene in the pathological cascade. Interventional trials in high-risk individuals may therefore be critical to the development of therapies that slow or halt PD progression.</p><p id="Par19">There were several limitations to our study. First, PD diagnoses were self-reported and not confirmed by a clinician. However, we have previously shown that self-reported PD diagnosis was equivalent to a telemedicine-based diagnosis by a neurologist in 100% of a sample of fifty people with PD from the 23andMe cohort.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup> Furthermore, our PD cohort has been used extensively in GWAS studies, contributing to the discovery of over 40 PD loci.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup> However, as misdiagnosis is not uncommon even in a clinical setting,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup> our study likely includes a unknown proportion of misdiagnosed individuals. Second, our analyses were restricted to individuals of European ancestry and further work is needed to determine whether our results are applicable to individuals from other ethnic backgrounds. Third, as with any epidemiological study, it is always possible that a subset of our associations were driven by unmeasured confounding variables, such as the use of PD medications. However, only 9 associations (6.4%) showed evidence of being confounded by four important demographic variables (education, income index, BMI, and tobacco use), two of which showed relatively large differences between PD cases and controls (BMI and tobacco use). Fourth, case&#x02013;control studies may be subject to recall bias, although this should be weaker for phenotypes that have not been widely reported to be associated with PD, such as those in the &#x0201c;novel&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;unclear&#x0201d; categories. Fifth, our study lacked temporal data for most phenotypes and we were therefore unable to determine whether they occurred prior to PD diagnosis. Finally, each regression was performed in a separate cohort, limiting our ability to make comparisons between association tests. Despite these limitations, we were able to replicate 27 known associations and&#x02014;apart from known associations for which we lacked relevant survey data, such as well water use&#x02014;there was only one known association that we narrowly failed to replicate.</p><p id="Par20">Epidemiological studies have identified a wide range of motor and non-motor phenotypes linked to PD. We successfully reproduced much of the established PD phenome using a systematic screen of a large database of online survey responses. We validated 27 known associations and highlighted an additional 23 associations with a strong prior link to a known association. Of the phenotypes that we tested that are part of the established PD phenome, only one (living near a farm) narrowly failed to reach significance. In addition, our work extends the PD phenome by discovering 42 novel associations and adding support to 30 associations that have previously been studied, but not in sufficient depth to be considered known or likely. Among these 30 unclear associations we found that migraine, OCD, and seasonal allergies were associated with PD, all of which tend to have an age of onset several decades before the average age of diagnosis for PD and may therefore represent PD risk factors. The novel phenotypic associations identified by our hypothesis-generating approach should be followed up in additional case&#x02013;control studies, as well as in prospective cohort and Mendelian randomization studies. Having a better understanding of the PD phenome may enable further studies that dissect the molecular mechanisms that drive these associations, perform causal inference to identify novel PD risk factors, and allow for the development of low-cost survey-based population screening tools to identify at-risk individuals.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec8"><title>Study participants</title><p id="Par21">People with PD were recruited through a targeted email campaign in conjunction with the Michael J.

In addition, we included environmental exposures that are unlikely to have a strong genetic component, such as pesticide use. We excluded phenotypes related to covariates used in downstream analyses, drug efficacy or side effects, and phenotypes for which PD was an inclusion or exclusion criterion. We excluded phenotypes for which there were fewer than 2000 PD cases or fewer than 10,000 total individuals who had answered the survey questions necessary to define the phenotype.

In order to focus on phenotypes that were not highly correlated with each other, we computed the partial correlation coefficient between each possible pair of phenotypes, a value ranging between &#x02212;1 (perfectly anticorrelated) to 1 (perfectly correlated).
