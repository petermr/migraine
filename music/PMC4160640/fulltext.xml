Introduction</title><p>Hearing loss is one of the greatest causes of disability (WHO), affecting up to 1 in 6 of the population. It is estimated that approximately 20% of the burden is generated from excessive noise exposure in occupational and leisure settings [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Hearing loss comes at a great economic cost (estimated at 1.6&#x02013;3.2% GDP in Australia; Access Economics Report, 2006) and reduces the quality of life of the affected individuals. On a personal level, hearing loss results in considerable communication difficulties, social isolation, and depression and appears to be associated with early cognitive decline [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The damage from noise exposure is cumulative over time and exacerbates the effects of aging on hearing loss.</p><p>Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) is particularly common in the military, in industrial settings (construction workers, mining, forestry, and aircraft industry), and in the music industry. The proportion of nonwork related NIHL is also considered to be on the rise contributing significantly to the overall impact of NIHL. Hearing conservation programs are generally ineffective [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], as there are many instances of unprotected exposure to excessive noise, particularly in the military and heavy industry. Cumulative NIHL associated with recreational activities and loud music from personal listening devices is also contributing to the growth in hearing disability. Sensory hair cells in the cochlea damaged by noise do not regenerate, so their loss is permanent. Prosthetic rehabilitation via hearing aids and cochlear implants is the only current treatment for hearing loss from inner ear injury and these have significant limitations. It is therefore important to develop therapies that can prevent or repair injury to the delicate inner ear structures rather than relying upon medical devices that boost residual hearing functionality. We and others have identified adenosine receptors as one of the most promising targets for the treatment of NIHL.</p><p>Adenosine is a cytoprotective substance released from tissues in response to stress. Acting on adenosine receptors (AR), adenosine augments antioxidant defences, increases oxygen supply, improves blood flow, inhibits the release of neurotransmitters, stabilises cells by stimulating K<sup>+</sup> channels and inhibiting Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, triggers anti-inflammatory responses, and promotes antiapoptotic pathways [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Neuroprotective actions of adenosine receptors in CNS disorders such as stroke, epilepsy, migraine, neurodegenerative, and neuropsychiatric disorders have been well documented [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Four distinct adenosine receptor subtypes have been characterised and designated as A<sub>1</sub>, A<sub>2A</sub>, A<sub>2B</sub>, and A<sub>3</sub> [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Selective AR agonists are now being developed as cardioprotective and neuroprotective (A<sub>1</sub> and A<sub>3</sub>), anti-inflammatory (A<sub>2A</sub> and A<sub>3</sub>), and antinociceptive (A<sub>1</sub>) agents, whilst AR antagonists show therapeutic potential as neuroprotective (A<sub>2A</sub>) and antiglaucoma (A<sub>3</sub>) agents [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Some of AR agonists either are FDA approved or are currently being investigated in clinical trials [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>All four adenosine receptors are expressed in the mammalian cochlea and they are differentially distributed in cochlear tissues [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Immunohistochemistry demonstrates that the sensory hair cells, supporting Deiters' cells and spiral ganglion neurons, express multiple adenosine receptors [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The sources of extracellular adenosine in cochlear fluids include active transport from the intracellular compartment by nucleoside transporters, adenosine release from damaged cells, and extracellular ATP hydrolysis [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Adenosine activates adenosine receptors on target cells in a paracrine or autocrine fashion, whilst the clearance of adenosine from the extracellular space is provided by nucleoside transporters [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>Previous studies have shown that prophylactic treatment with adenosine receptor agonists mitigates hearing loss from noise [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and the anticancer drug cisplatin [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. We have shown that the local or systemic administration of selective A<sub>1</sub> adenosine receptor (A<sub>1</sub>R) agonists, such as 2-chloro-<italic>N</italic>
<sup>6</sup>-cyclopentyladenosine (CCPA) and adenosine amine congener (ADAC), can ameliorate cochlear injury and hearing loss following noise exposure [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The important aspect of this finding is that the drugs were administered after the cessation of noise exposure, suggesting that A<sub>1</sub>R agonists could be useful for the treatment of acute noise-induced cochlear injury within a therapeutic window, and not only as prophylactics. In contrast to other drugs acting on A<sub>1</sub>R, ADAC lacks cardiovascular side effects at the dose used to treat NIHL in these experiments [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], which suggests its suitability for systemic administration. The lack of systemic side effects within the therapeutic dose range for NIHL is due to a modified chemical structure, and its increased ability to cross the blood-brain barrier [<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] likely reflects permeability across the blood/perilymph partition within the cochlea. We previously showed that a five-day treatment of daily ADAC injections, starting six hours after exposure to noise, rescued up to 25&#x02009;dB of otherwise permanent hearing loss [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. For reference, 10&#x02009;dB rescue in hearing thresholds is considered clinically significant [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The improvement of hearing thresholds was supported by increased survival of sensory hair cells and reduced expression of oxidative stress markers in the cochlea. We have also shown that ADAC ameliorates cisplatin-induced cochlear injury and hearing loss [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>In the present study, using a rat model, we demonstrate the time window for ADAC otoprotective treatment after noise exposure and the optimal doses for systemic administration. Pharmacokinetic studies demonstrate changes in ADAC concentrations in plasma after systemic administration. These data provide a background for drug development studies which aim to establish the suitability of ADAC as a treatment for acute NIHL.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>2. Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec2.1"><title>2.1. Animals</title><p>The studies were performed on male Wistar rats (8&#x02013;10 weeks old) sourced from the animal facility at the University of Auckland. All procedures in this study were approved by the University of Auckland Animal Ethics Committee and conformed to international guidelines for the ethical use of animals. After completion of manipulations, animals were euthanised using sodium pentobarbital (100&#x02009;mg/kg, i.p.) and cochlear tissues collected for histology.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.2"><title>2.2. Noise Exposure</title><p>Rats were exposed to 8&#x02013;16&#x02009;kHz octave band noise for 2 hours at 110&#x02009;dB&#x02009;SPL to induce permanent hearing loss in untreated animals. Noise exposures were carried out in a custom-built acoustic chamber (Shelburg Acoustics, Sydney, Australia) with internal speakers and external controls (sound generator and frequency selector). The sound intensity inside the chamber was measured using a calibrated Bruel &#x00026; Kjaer 2232 sound level meter to ensure minimal deviations of sound intensity. Control animals were housed in the animal facility at ambient sound conditions (45&#x02013;55&#x02009;dB&#x02009;SPL, 0.5&#x02013;20&#x02009;kHz).</p></sec><sec id="sec2.3"><title>2.3. Auditory Brainstem Responses (ABR)</title><p>ABR thresholds in response to 8&#x02013;28&#x02009;kHz tone pips were measured in a sound attenuating chamber (Shelburg Acoustics, Sydney, Australia) before and 12 days after noise exposure. Rats were anaesthetised with a mixture of ketamine (90&#x02009;mg/kg) and xylazine (10&#x02009;mg/kg) intraperitoneally and then placed onto a heating pad, to maintain body temperature at 37&#x000b0;C. ABRs were obtained by placing fine platinum electrodes subdermally at the mastoid region of the ear of interest (active electrode), scalp vertex (reference), and mastoid region of the opposite ear (ground electrode). The acoustic stimuli were supplied via a TD48 Beyer dynamic transducer connected to a 10&#x02009;cm plastic tube that was placed into the external auditory canal of the left ear. A Tucker-Davis Technology (TDT) auditory physiology workstation System 3 (Alachua, FL, USA), equipped with a computer-based digital signal processing package and software (BioSig, Alachua), was used to produce the acoustic stimuli and record the ABR responses. Tone pips (5&#x02009;ms, 0.5&#x02009;ms rise-fall time) were presented at frequencies between 8 and 28&#x02009;kHz at varying intensity levels. The threshold of the ABR complex (waves I&#x02013;V) were determined by progressively attenuating the sound intensity in 5&#x02009;dB steps until the wave I&#x02013;V complex of the averaged ABR waveforms (1024 repeats with stimulus polarity alternated) was no longer distinguishable from noise floor in recorded traces. The ABR threshold was defined as the lowest intensity (to the nearest 5&#x02009;dB) at which a response could be visually detected above the noise floor. Repeat waveforms were analysed at each frequency to determine the consistency of the responses and to identify the recurring peaks.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.4"><title>2.4. ADAC Treatment</title><p>ADAC (Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in 1&#x02009;M&#x02009;HCl and then in 0.1&#x02009;M phosphate buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.4) to prepare a 100&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/mL stock solution. The stock solution was then aliquoted and stored at &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C for later use. Light-protected ADAC aliquots were thawed at 37&#x000b0;C for 30&#x02009;min before administration. In study one, the following single ADAC dosages were used to optimize the rescue dose: 25, 50, 100, 200, and 300&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/kg/day. An equal volume of vehicle solution was given to control animals. ADAC or control vehicle solution was administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) for five consecutive days at 24&#x02009;h intervals, beginning six hours after the cessation of noise exposure. In study two, one of the higher ADAC doses (200&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/kg) was used to determine the time window for treatment after noise exposure. ADAC treatment (five daily injections at 24&#x02009;h intervals) commenced at 12, 24, 48, or 72 hours after noise exposure.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.5"><title>2.5. Measurement of ADAC Concentrations in Rat Plasma after Intravenous Administration</title><p>Male Wistar rats (8 weeks old) were anaesthetised with ketamine (90&#x02009;mg/kg i.p.) plus xylazine (10&#x02009;mg/kg i.p.) and the femoral vein was surgically exposed. ADAC (400&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/kg) was injected (1&#x02009;mL/min) through the femoral vein, and blood samples (0.5&#x02009;mL) were taken from the heart. Up to 1.5&#x02009;mL of blood was taken from each animal, and the first sample was drawn 1&#x02009;min after drug delivery. Subsequent extraction and purification procedures were modified from Stocchi et al. [<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Briefly, after deproteination with 0.1&#x02009;M KOH, plasma was extracted from the blood using an Amicon Ultra-4 50&#x02009;K centrifugal filtering device (Merck Millipore, Tullagreen, Carrigtwohill, IRL). The filtrate was mixed with 50&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>L of 1&#x02009;M KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> and subjected to HPLC analysis using an Agilent 1100 series instrument (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, California, USA). Reverse phase HPLC separation of ADAC was achieved on a Phenomenex Gemini 3&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>m C18 column (150 &#x000d7; 3.00&#x02009;mm, 110&#x02009;&#x000c5;) protected with a Phenomenex Gemini C18 guard column (4 &#x000d7; 2.0&#x02009;mm i.d.). The mobile phase used for the separation of ADAC from the matrix peaks consisted of two eluents: 45&#x02009;mM ammonium formate in water, pH 7 (aqueous mobile phase A), and 100% acetonitrile (organic mobile phase B).

Dose-Response Study</title><p>ADAC (25&#x02013;300&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/kg) was administered to noise-exposed Wistar rats for five consecutive days, commencing six hours after noise exposure (8&#x02013;16&#x02009;kHz, 110&#x02009;dB&#x02009;SPL for 2 hours). Auditory thresholds were assessed using auditory brainstem responses (ABR) before and 12 days after noise exposure. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"> Figure 1</xref> shows the baseline and final ABR thresholds in ADAC- and vehicle-treated (control) rats. Baseline ABR thresholds were comparable in all groups. All ADAC-treated groups showed a broad reduction of final thresholds across the 8&#x02013;28&#x02009;kHz frequency range compared with the hearing loss in the control group. ABR threshold shifts for each frequency are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. In the control noise-exposed and nontreated group, the average threshold shift across the frequencies was 37&#x02009;dB, with the largest shift of 40&#x02009;dB at 12&#x02009;kHz. In this study, all ADAC doses significantly (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) reduced the extent of the threshold shift at some or all frequencies. The most effective ADAC doses (100&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/kg and 200&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/kg) reduced average noise-induced threshold shift across the frequencies by 21&#x02009;dB and 18&#x02009;dB, respectively (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001; ANOVA). These two ADAC doses significantly (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) reduced threshold shifts at 8&#x02013;24&#x02009;kHz frequencies, but thresholds at the highest frequency (28&#x02009;kHz) improved only with a 100&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/kg ADAC dose. The 300&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/kg and 25&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/kg doses were also effective, reducing average threshold shift by 15&#x02009;dB and 13&#x02009;dB, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The 50&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/kg ADAC doses were the least effective, reducing average threshold shifts by 7&#x02009;dB (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). The effect of this dose was significantly (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01) lower compared to ADAC doses over 100&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/kg.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.2"><title>3.2.

The outcomes were measured using ABR before and 12 days after noise exposure. ADAC treatment significantly (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) reduced ABR threshold shifts in the treatment groups that commenced 12 and 24 hours postnoise exposure by 18&#x02009;dB and 16&#x02009;dB, respectively, averaged across the measured frequencies. The treatment regime that commenced 48 hours after noise exposure produced an average protection of 8&#x02009;dB, which was also statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01). At 72 hours delay before commencing ADAC treatment, the threshold shifts were similar to nontreated animals.

Pharmacokinetic Properties of ADAC after Systemic Administration</title><p>ADAC concentrations in plasma were determined using HPLC analysis. As expected, ADAC concentration was highest shortly after i.v. administration, followed by a rapid distribution and elimination phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), but without detection of degradation products. The graph shows concentration changes of ADAC in rat plasma for the time period of 12 minutes; after that, ADAC concentrations dropped below the limit of UV-Vis detection (~0.1&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/mL). The pharmacokinetic properties of ADAC in plasma were analysed by PKSolver, an add-in program for pharmacokinetic data analysis in Microsoft Excel [<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> shows that ADAC has a short (5&#x02009;min) half-life (<italic>T</italic>

ADAC was detected at 5&#x02009;min after injection in 4 out of 6 cochleae obtained from 3 animals but at 15&#x02009;min postinjection ADAC was no longer detectable (data not shown). More sensitive assay is required to accurately assess ADAC concentrations in cochlear perilymph.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>4. Discussion</title><p>This study shows that ADAC mitigates noise-induced hearing loss in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The ADAC was effective across the broad dose range, from 25&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/kg&#x02013;300&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/kg i.p., reducing noise-induced threshold shifts by clinically significant levels [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] across the tested frequency range. At some frequencies, threshold improvement was up to 25&#x02009;dB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). ADAC was most effective at rescuing NIHL when treatment commenced within 24 hours after noise exposure. After 48 hours, ADAC improved ABR thresholds by more than 10&#x02009;dB at two frequencies, 8&#x02009;kHz and 20&#x02009;kHz, suggesting that even delayed treatment could be useful. Pharmacokinetic studies demonstrated a short half-life of ADAC in plasma after intravenous administration without detection of degradation products. This rapid clearance suggests broad uptake into tissue compartments.</p><p>The dose-response curve for individual ADAC doses was nonlinear (nonmonotonic). The doses over 100&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/kg were the most effective in reducing threshold shifts, followed by 25 and 50&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/kg. Nonmonotonic dose response curves are often U-shaped or inverted U-shape (biphasic) but can also show complex multiphasic shape [<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Similar nonmonotonic dose-response curves were observed in gerbils, in the study investigating the neuroprotective effect of ADAC in experimentally induced cerebral ischaemia [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In that study, acute prophylactic administration of ADAC at doses ranging from 25 to 200&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/kg was effective in preserving neurons, apart from the 50&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/kg dose, which failed to improve neuronal survival. In the same study, chronic treatment with ADAC was effective at lower doses: 10&#x02013;100&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/kg in reducing mortality, and 25&#x02013;100&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/kg in neuronal preservation. Another study showed that an acute treatment with ADAC (100&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/kg) is strongly neuroprotective in a model of Huntington's disease [<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], whilst chronic administration at the same dose was ineffective. Together with our results, these studies provide a good indication of the neuro- and otoprotective dose range for ADAC, with the caveats such as different dosing schedules and disease models, and possible species-related differences in tissue distribution and affinity of A<sub>1</sub>R.</p><p>The present study also demonstrates pharmacokinetic properties of ADAC in rat plasma. The ADAC concentration curve follows a one-compartment bolus model with first-order output. The short half-life (5 minutes) of ADAC in plasma after intravenous injection is most likely due to rapid distribution in tissues, and it may explain a lack of side effects reported previously [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. ADAC was detected in the cochlea 5&#x02009;min after administration, but the low sensitivity of the UV-Vis detection precluded the pharmacokinetic study after systemic administration. The peak cochlear level of ADAC detected following intravenous administration was consistent with pharmacological action, given the high affinity of A<sub>1</sub> receptors for ADAC [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. More sensitive method of detection, such as LC/MS, will be required to characterise ADAC concentrations in cochlear perilymph with different delivery routes.</p><p>In NIHL, postinsult time to the initiation of the treatment is an important factor which significantly affects treatment outcomes. Oxidative stress and the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) in the cochlea is one of the major mechanisms of cochlear injury during and after noise exposure [<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. ROS levels increase postexposure, due to heavy cellular energy demands and reperfusion [<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Production of superoxide and other free radicals reaches a maximum 7 to 10 days after exposure [<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], and the production of ROS/RNS correlates with a gradual spread of hair cell loss postexposure. The peroxidation of membrane lipids, along with oxidative damage to DNA and cellular proteins, results in cell death after noise exposure [<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Oxidative stress and other cellular events, such as inflammation and calcium overload, contribute to the development of cochlear injury after exposure to traumatic noise but also provide a window of opportunity to treat cochlear injury postexposure. We have previously shown that adenosine receptor agonists provide an effective postexposure treatment of acoustic injury and NIHL [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], and the present study defines the window of opportunity for cochlear rescue. ADAC treatment provides partial rescue in the first 24 hours after noise exposure, but after that cochlear injury becomes less responsive to treatment. This is consistent with other studies demonstrating partial recovery of auditory thresholds in the first 24 hours after exposure to traumatic noise after administration of antioxidants [<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] or antiapoptotic agents [<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Despite the fact that free radical production appears to continue for up to 10 days after exposure, it appears that oxidative stress rapidly leads to irreversible cochlear injury and the substantial loss of critical tissues such as sensory hair cells beyond the first 24 hours, which limits the window of opportunity for pharmacological treatment of hearing loss from acute noise exposure.</p><p>The basic cochlear protection model by ADAC has been summarised in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>. Acoustic trauma can induce excessive generation of free radicals in the cochlea by overdriving the mitochondria; it can reduce cochlear blood flow, cause excitotoxic swelling of afferent nerve terminals, induce intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> overload in sensory hair cells, and cause inflammation in cochlear tissues [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Cellular damage results in cell death from a combination of necrosis and apoptosis, which leads to hearing loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Our experimental evidence suggests that ADAC can reduce oxidative stress in the noise-exposed cochlea, leading to protection of sensory hair cells [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. We have also demonstrated that ADAC can reduce cisplatin-induced apoptosis in cochlear tissues, particularly in sensory hair cells and strial marginal cells [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Other putative mechanisms of otoprotection by ADAC include inhibition of glutamate release via presynaptic A<sub>1</sub> receptors and inhibition of voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, which can prevent activation of apoptotic and necrotic cell death pathways [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. However, further studies are required to fully understand the otoprotective mechanisms of ADAC, particularly with regard to cochlear afferent neurons.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>5. Conclusion</title><p>Our study suggests that ADAC has a potential to be developed as a clinical otological treatment for acute hearing loss caused by exposure to traumatic noise. We show that systemic administration route is effective in mitigating cochlear injury. Previous studies suggest that the use of ADAC is not contraindicated by cardiovascular side effects at the doses used for otoprotection and neuroprotection; however, clinical trials will be necessary to confirm its safety for human use. Currently, the intratympanic administration to achieve uptake via the round window is a preferred otological drug development pathway, as it obviates possible systemic side effects (unlikely to be a factor with ADAC, but of significant regulatory body concern), and this also counters metabolism/elimination. On the other hand, intratympanic drug delivery requires expert otological intervention, whereas systemic drug administration would be more practical in a broader range of clinical situations, or circumstances where specialist surgical intervention is untenable. This is particularly relevant given that the 24-hour therapeutic window that this study indicates is therapeutically effective. Future studies are thus required to establish the optimal drug delivery method but also to establish the mechanisms of action and the optimum usage situations for ADAC. The therapeutic efficacy of ADAC for NIHL should also be evaluated in other animal models.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This study was supported by the Deafness Research
