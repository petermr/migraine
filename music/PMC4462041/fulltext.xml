chemical structures are similar to other psychoactive compounds but not identical, representing a
&#x0201c;legal&#x0201d; alternative to internationally controlled drugs. There are many categories of NPS, such as
synthetic cannabinoids, synthetic cathinones, phenylethylamines, piperazines, ketamine derivatives
and tryptamines. Tryptamines are naturally occurring compounds, which can derive from the amino
acid tryptophan by several biosynthetic pathways: their structure is a combination of a benzene ring
and a pyrrole ring, with the addition of a 2-carbon side chain. Tryptamines include serotonin and melatonin as well as
other compounds known for their hallucinogenic properties, such as psilocybin in &#x02018;Magic mushrooms&#x02019; and
dimethyltryptamine (DMT) in Ayahuasca brews.</p><sec><title>Aim:</title><p> To review the scientific literature regarding tryptamines and their derivatives, providing a summary of all the

administration, their pharmacology and toxicity, including articles reporting cases of death related to intake of these
substances.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods:</title><p> A comprehensive review of the published scientific literature was performed, using also non peer-reviewed

According to Zuba, &#x0201c;they are created usually by manipulating already existing psychoactive substances or, less, by finding drugs with a new chemical structure that may produce similar effects to those of the illegal drugs of abuse&#x0201d; [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. They may be formulated as &#x0201c;bulk powders, liquids, tablets, capsules, blotters,&#x0201d; or herbal preparations, indeed on the web sites these drugs are sold as &#x0201c;research chemicals,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;incense,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;bath salts,&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;plant-growth fertilizers,&#x0201d; equipped with labels specifying that the products are &#x0201c;not for human consumption&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;not for sale to minors&#x0201d; [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The International Narcotics Control Boardregards the Internet &#x0201c;as a growing source of on-line drug trafficking&#x0201d;: products purchased on Internet may vary over time proposing chemicals always different, not listed in literature, meaning that users are often unaware of what or how much they are taking [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], causing increasing risks to public health. The phenomenon of marketing illicit drug &#x02018;&#x02018;derivatives&#x02019;&#x02019; grew mainly because of their easy availability on the Internet or in &#x0201c;head shops&#x0201d;. The use of NPS has increased dramatically in recent years: only in the European Union, the number of NPS identified has risen &#x0201c;from 14 at the end of 2005 to 236 by the end of 2012&#x0201d; [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The majority of new recreational synthetic drugs fall into one of the following psychoactive drug categories: synthetic cannabinoids, synthetic cathinones, phenylethylamines, piperazines, ketamine derivatives and tryptamines.</p><p>Tryptamines are a group of monoamine alkaloids (Fig. <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref></bold>), which can be synthesized by decarboxylation of the aminoacid tryptophan: they can be found in plants, fungi, animals, microbes and amphibia [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. </p><p>Tryptamines have an indole ring structure, a fused double ring comprising of a pyrrole ring and a benzene ring, joined to an amino group by 2 carbon side chain. </p><p>The tryptamines play a fundamental role in human life: serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT), one of the most important signaling hormones [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] in the body, is a tryptamine natural derivative involved in regulation and modulation of multiple processes within the central nervous system, such as sleep, cognition, memory, temperature regulation and behavior [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Moreover, mammalian brain contains very low concentrations (in the low ng/g range) of tryptamine, which may act as a neurotransmitter or modulator [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]: it acts as a serotonin releasing agent and it is an enhancer of serotonergic activity [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Gibbons in his publication, defines the nature &#x0201c;an astounding chemist (..) able to produce compounds that have profound effects on the central nervous system (CNS)&#x0201d;[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Naturally occurring derivatives of the tryptamines are present in the &#x02018;Magic mushrooms&#x02019; belonging to <italic>Psilocybe cubensis </italic>species, which contain psilocybin (4-phosphoryloxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine) and psilocin (4-hydroxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine), the latter showing marked similarities with serotonin (Fig. <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref></bold>). </p><p>Another example of the ability of the natural world to create hallucinogenic substances, is the 5-hydroxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine (bufotenine), a positional isomer of psilocin [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], which is contained in the skin and glands of various species of toad of the genus <italic>Bufo </italic>[<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Chemical modifications of the nucleus structure of the tryptamine molecule produce new compounds which may cause alterations of the physical and mental status: substitutions on the indole ring, on the two carbons of the side chain and alkylation of the side-chain nitrogen result in new neuroactive compounds, ranging from toxic substances to anti-migraine drugs, such as Sumatriptan [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], Rizatriptan and Zolmitriptan (Fig. <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref></bold>).</p><p>Tryptamines show agonist action at multiple receptors, including 5HT2a-1a-2c [<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] serotonin receptors [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], and several ion channels [<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In general, tryptamines seem to have hallucinogenic properties, rather than stimulant or entactogenic characteristics: their alpha methylation leads to stimulant activity [&#x003b1;-methyltryptamine (AMT), 5-methoxy-&#x003b1;-methyltryptamine (5-MeO-AMT)], being the presence of an alpha carbon methyl group, a characteristic in common with amphetamine [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr"> 18</xref>]. The synthesis and the effects of these compounds have been fully investigated by Alexander T. Shulgin who described his experiences within the book Tihkal [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]: he identified 55 molecules and he tested these substances on volunteers to assess their effects according to his rating scale. Recreational use of tryptamines requires only minute amounts to produce psychotropic phenomena and has been associated to intoxications and fatalities for several reasons, including low toxic concentrations. Moreover, these molecules are not routinary detected with common screening panels, so far in emergency rooms the test could result completely negative leading to misunderstanding diagnosis or therapy and limited evaluation of the phenomenon. It is very important to organize the information pertaining to these substances to provide a tool for specialists facing this emerging threat to public health and public security. For this reason a comprehensive review of the scientific literature and internet sites regarding tryptamines and their derivatives was carried out, providing a summary of all the available information about the structure of these compounds, their effects in relationship with the routes of administration and their toxicity, including articles reporting cases of death related to intake of these substances and analytical methods for the determination and quantification of some tryptamines. </p></sec><sec><title>CLASSIFICATION OF TRYPTAMINES BASED ON THEIR CHEMICAL STRUCTURES</title><p>Several classifications have been suggested for these substances. Nichols classified tryptamines in two main groups: -the simple tryptamines, including dimethyltryptamine (DMT), and the ergolines (a group of chemical compounds that were originally synthesized from a fungus ergot, among which is the lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD). Fantegrossi divided tryptamines in three subgroups: (1) simple tryptamines, without modification of the indole ring; (2) tryptamines having a modification on the 4-position on the indole ring; (3) tryptamines having a modification on the 5-position. Only substitutions on the 4-5 positions were considered because changes in position 6 or 7 result in reduced hallucinogenic activity [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] (Fig. <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref></bold>).</p></sec><sec><title>STRUCTURE-ACTIVITY RELATIONSHIPS IN TRYPTAMINES AND THEIR METABOLISM</title><p>The effects caused by the administration of tryptamines are closely related to their structures, as each of these compounds has a different receptor affinity to which are related psychoactive phenomena.</p></sec><sec><title>RING UNSUBSTITUTED COMPOUNDS </title><p>Several compounds belong to this class, including &#x003b1;-methyltryptamine (AMT, street name Spirals) and &#x003b1;-ethyltryptamine (AET) both showing stimulant activities [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>
<bold><underline>Alpha-methyltryptamine</underline></bold> (AMT) was firstly developed as an antidepressant agent called as INDOPAN, in 1960&#x02019;s by the Upjohn Company and used for a short period of time in the former Soviet Union [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], but at last it was recognized as a toxic substance able to produce psychosis [<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>AMT activity is linked with the release of dopamine and its re-uptake inhibition. AMT also acts on serotonin and noradrenaline receptors and inhibits MAO activity <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, therefore it is active after oral administration. Nagai [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] in his study, developed a method to determine the reuptake and release of monoamines (dopamine, serotonin and norepinephrine), and &#x0201c;analyzed the effects of various designer drugs on monoamine neurotransmission&#x0201d;, using rat brain synaptosomes. He disclosed that AMT presented the &#x0201c;strongest monoamine re-uptake inhibitory activity and release stimulating activity, although monoamine release was more dominant than re-uptake inhibition&#x0201d; [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Furthermore, he discovered that 5-MeO-AMT, &#x0201c;inhibited monoamine (dopamine, 5-HT and norepinephrine) re-uptake and stimulated monoamine release; its potency was second to that of AMT. AMT and 5-MeO-AMT both have a primary amine group, which in tryptamine might be indispensable for the stimulation of monoamine release&#x0201d; [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Illegal use of &#x003b1;-methyl-tryptamine is based on its hallucinogenic and psychedelic visual effects, with doses ranging from 15 to 30 mg if administered orally. It can be smoked (4-20 mg) as freebase, and snorted as well. The onset of action, if orally administered, is between 3 and 4 hours, generally lasting up to 12-24 hours, but in some subjects the action can last until 2 days. The onset of action if smoked is in the range of seconds or minutes. Uncomfortable feelings are reported, such as restlessness and irritability, hyperthermia, anorexia, vomiting, inability to sleep, tachycardia, increase in blood pressure pupils dilatation, deep tendon reflexes and coordination impairment [<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Wilcox [<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] interviewed 15 individuals who had used &#x003b1;-methyltryptamine. Most common side effects reported were anxiety, nausea and moderately severe dysphoria as well as depression (15% severely depressed mood on the day after). The 90% of patients reported visual hallucinations and 87 % euphoria. Anxiety was lamented in 35% of cases, in a correlation with crowded environment. AMT, as every psychedelic agent can alter judgement and perception and therefore it can cause dangerous behaviours. In the US, since 2004, it&#x02019;s placed as a schedule I substance, while in the UK it was completely legal until June 2014 [<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. According to the NPSAD (National Program on Substance Deaths Abuse) Annual Report, from January to December 2012 in the UK, &#x003b1;-methyltryptamine has showed the highest number of deaths (2 reported in 2011 and 4 reported in 2012) compared to tryptamine or 5-methoxy-diallyltryptamine (5-MeO-DALT) [<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. </p><p>Also <underline><bold>alpha-ethyltryptamine</bold></underline> (AET) was firstly introduced as an antidepressant agent by Upjohn company in 1960s with the name MONASE, but it was withdrawn from the market because of an unacceptable incidence of idiosyncratic agranulocytosis. AET may induce serotonin neurotoxicity [<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], similar to that of MDMA and para-chloroamphetamine (PCA), as reported in studies on rats. AET inhibits MAO activity [<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] <italic>in vitro </italic>and<italic> in vivo</italic>, as AMT, and it is orally active. Lessins [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] studied the effects of these two alpha-tryptamine derivatives in mice, observing marked stimulation with increased locomotor activity, hyperthermia, midriasis and generalized body tremor: AET assumption is also correlated with psychedelic, stimulant, and entactogenic effects.</p><p>The dosage reported by Shulgin, for oral administration, is 100-150 mg. and it seems to be able to fight opiate addiction in anecdotal reports. &#x0201c;It appears to serve well, with short term dosage regimens, as an effective tool in kicking dependency on opiates&#x0201d; [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. </p><p>
<bold><underline>Dimethyl-tryptamine</underline></bold> (DMT) was first synthesized in 1931 by Richard Helmuth Fredrick Manske, but it was discovered as a natural product only in 1946, when a brazilian chemist and microbiologist, Oswaldo Gon&#x000e7;alves de Lima, isolated it from the root bark of <italic>Mimosa tenuiflora</italic>. Since 1955 DMT has been found in at least fifty species of plants belonging to ten families [<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], in four species of animals, and in three species of mammals. The biosynthesis of DMT begins with the decarboxylation of tryptophan that leads to the production of tryptamine. Further, tryptamine undergoes a methylation process, generating the intermediate product N-methyltryptamine (NMT). NMT is in turn transmethylated to form the final product N,N-dimethyl tryptamine. DMT binds several serotonin receptors, acting as a partial agonist in particular on the 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> and 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptors. It has also been shown to possess affinity for the &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub> and &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptors, dopamine D<sub>1</sub>, and sigma-1 (&#x003c3;<sub>1</sub>). The psychedelic activity of DMT, similar to LSD and mescaline, can probably be attributed to the binding to 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor, although the activation of other receptors, such as 5-HT<sub>2C </sub>and sigma-1, may play a very important role in the onset of these effects [<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. DMT can be taken orally, intravenously or by inhalation. When inhaled, a standard dose of DMT is 15&#x02013;60 mg. The onset of the effects is very fast, less than 45 seconds, peak effects are reached within a minute and they last usually for about 15 minutes. The experiences after injecting a DMT are similar to inhalation in duration, intensity and characteristics. If orally administered DMT must be associated with a MAOI, as it is deaminated by monoamine oxidase and is quickly inactivated. The Ayahuasca brew, used in religious rituals of the native peoples of the Amazon, is obtained by boiling the Ayahuasca vine (<italic>Banisteriopsis caapi)</italic>, that contains monoamine oxidase inhibitors (&#x000df;-carbolines harmaline, harmine, and 1,2,3,4 tetrahydroharmine) with the leaves of shrubs of the genus <italic>Psychotria </italic>or<italic> Diplopterys</italic>, that contains DMT. A review on the risk assessment of the use of Ayahuasca has been made by Gable, who reported that to achieve the lethal dose in humans, it would be necessary to ingest more than 20 times the ceremonial dose. The brew seems also to have minimal dependence potential [<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p><p>
<bold><underline>Diethyl-tryptamine</underline></bold> (DET) has not been found to occur naturally and, although presenting structural similarity to DMT, it is active when administered orally, due to the presence of two ethyl groups linked to its nitrogen atom, preventing its degradation by MAO. Its mechanism of action is not clear, but, like other psychedelic tryptamines, DET could present an agonist activity towards serotonin receptors [<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr"> 32</xref>]. When orally administered the dosage is 50&#x02013;100 mg and the effects are reported to last about 2&#x02013;4 hours [<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. </p><p>
<bold><underline>Dipropyl-tryptamine</underline></bold> (DPT) was firstly synthesized in the 1950s [<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], but it was firstly reported for use in the scientific literature only in 1973 [<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], as an adjunct in psychotherapy of alcoholics. It is found either as its crystalline hydrochloride salt or as an oily or crystalline base and, as DET, it has not been found to occur naturally. There are few peer-reviewed experimental studies that try to explain the ways of interaction among DPT and serotonin receptors: Nagai revealed a strong inhibition of 5-HT reuptake in rat synaptosomes [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], and Thiagaraj also observed a moderate affinity partial agonism at the human 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor [<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Experiences related to DPT assumption are mostly psychedelic sensations, such as an increase of music and colors intensity, the vision of pleasant flashes of light and sparkles, a complete ego loss, and apparitions of faces. The dosage of DPT, for oral administration, is 100-250 mg and the duration of the psychoactive effects varies from 2 to 4 hours.</p><p>
<bold><underline>Diisopropyl-tryptamine</underline></bold> (DiPT) is a synthetic hallucinogen, structurally related to dimethyl-tryptamine, but, unlike DMT, which produces short term visual hallucinations, DiPT causes auditory distortions [<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. DiPT presents a similar molecular mechanism of action as other hallucinogens. It is an agonist at 5HT<sub>2A</sub> receptors and a partial agonist at 5HT<sub>1A</sub> receptors [<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], but 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> activity &#x0201c;is not thought to be necessary for hallucinogenic effects&#x0201d; [<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Furthermore, DiPT blocks the serotonin uptake and it has little interaction with dopamine or norepinephrine transporters [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. </p><p>Effective dosage, orally administered, ranges from 50 to 100 mg [<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] and the hallucinogenic effects continue until 6-8 hours. </p></sec><sec><title>4-POSITION MODIFIED TRYPTAMINES</title><p>
<bold><underline>Psilocin</underline></bold> (4-OH-DMT) can be assumed &#x0201c;as the prototypical agent of the 4-position modified tryptamines&#x0201d; [<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. It is obtained by dephosphorylation in the body of <underline><bold>psilocybin</bold></underline> found in hallucinogenic mushrooms of the species <italic>Psilocybe</italic> and <italic>Stropharia</italic>. In<italic> P. cubensis</italic>, psilocybin percentage varies from 0.2% to 0.4% of the dry weight [<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], while psilocin is only present in trace amounts. After ingestion, psilocybin undergoes rapid hydrolysis of the phosphate groups by the alkaline phosphatase and then turns into its active metabolite psilocin, representing the active drug of abuse [<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. After the ingestion of <italic>Psylocibe</italic> &#x02018;Magic mushrooms&#x02019;, the hallucinogenic effects arise within the first 2 hours and then decrease in the subsequent 3-4 hours to disappear within 4-8 hours. The threshold of intoxication is reached after the intake of 40 &#x000b5;g psilocybin/kg body weight; &#x0201c; typically 1&#x02013;2 g of dried mushroom is ingested&#x0201d;, which yields from 2 to 8 mg of psilocybin [<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. &#x0201c;Pharmacokinetic studies of psilocybin in humans have shown&#x0201d; that, after &#x0201c;the rapid dephosphorylation of psilocybin to psilocin&#x0201d;, there is a conversion in plasma of &#x0201c;the psilocin into 4-hydroxy-tryptophole (4HT) and 4-hydroxyindole-3-acetic acid (4HIAA)&#x0201d; [<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Grieshaber showed that psilocin undergoes conjugation with glucuronic acid in the liver and it can be found in the urine as the psilocin-glucuronide conjugate [<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Psilocin is a partial 5HT<sub>2a</sub> agonist [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], but it is also agonistic at other serotonin receptors, with little dopaminergic or noradrenergic action: these activities explain the onset of sympathetic stimulations, such as tachycardia and hypertension, along with those of the predominant hallucinogenic effects [<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Psilocybin is orally active, with effective doses in the range of 6&#x02013;20 mg.

<bold><underline>Bufotenine</underline></bold> (Fig. <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref></bold>), or 5-OH-dimethyltryptamine (5-OH-DMT), is an N-alkylated derivative of serotonin and it was first synthesized by Wieland in 1934 [<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]: it can be isolated from plants <italic>Piptadenia peregrina</italic> and <italic>P. macrocarpa</italic> (Mimosaceae), the mushrooms <italic>Amanita</italic> (spp) and from the skin glands of toads (<italic>Bufo </italic>spp.) [<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Fuller, studying the metabolism, the tissue distribution and the effects of 5-OH-DMT on rats, showed that, after injection in the animals, it was present in highest concentration in lung and in heart rather than in brain: this, probably, means that it does not cross well the blood-brain barrier, just as serotonin [<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. In tissues studies, he found that bufotenine was rapidly eliminated, disappearing within 8 hours, after reaching peak concentrations at 1 hour. Moreover, the large increases of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5HIAA), the endogenous metabolite of serotonin, in all tissues suggested that bufotenine was metabolized by MAO-A through the pathway of oxidative deamination.</p><p> Ott, published the results of his human self-experiments with bufotenine: he self administered bufotenine as free base, <italic>via </italic>intranasal (5&#x02013;100 mg), sublingually (50 mg), intrarectally (30 mg), pulmonary (as inhaled vapor, in a dosage of 2&#x02013;8 mg) and orally (100 mg).

He recorded that at 5 minutes after the 40 mg administration, he felt the onset of tinnitus; at 25 minutes he felt the body effects typical of the intakes of tryptamines; the peak arrived between 35 and 40 minutes and all the psychoactive sensations vanished after 90 minutes.

<bold><underline>5-methoxy-&#x003b1;-methyltryptamine</underline></bold> (5-MeO-AMT) is a psychedelic tryptamine which presents structural similarities to the amphetamines: because of these characteristics, 5-MeO-AMT was occasionally sold under the guise of LSD, as emerges from the reports of Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) about seizures of sugar cube, or blotters LSD-style, containing this tryptamine [<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>].

If misrepresented as LSD, 5-MeO-AMT can be very harmful or even fatal: in fact, incorrect or excessive administration of the substance, mistaken for LSD, has been the cause of several hospital admissions [<xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] or sudden deaths [<xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. </p><p>It is likely that the danger related to 5-MeO-AMT assumption is due to its sympathomimetic effects, that include, as side effects, cardiac arrhythmia and seizure. </p><p>
<bold><underline>5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine</underline></bold> (5-MeO-DMT) is a naturally occurring psychoactive indolealkylamine substance, closely related to DMT and bufotenine. It was initially isolated from the bark of <italic>Dictyoloma incanescens </italic>[<xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>], but it was found also in the venom of Colorado River <italic>Bufo alvarius</italic>, secreted by parotoid and tibial glands. This compound is a potent, fast acting hallucinogen [<xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], producing psychedelic effects, with a short duration in humans: it has high affinity for the 5-HT<sub>1A </sub>serotonin receptor, causing many physiological and behavioral changes. It can be administered by different routes, as reported in the Table <bold><xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref></bold>.</p><p>5-MeO-DMT is mainly metabolized by monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) through a deamination pathway, and it is <italic>O</italic>-demethylated by cytochrome P450 (CYP2D6) enzyme [<xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], producing, as active metabolite, bufotenine, which binds 5-HT<sub>2A </sub>receptor with higher affinity than 5-MeO-DMT itself. </p><p>For this reason, to produce a prolonged hallucinogen effect when orally administered, 5-MeO-DMT requires the concomitant use of a MAOI, such as harmaline. This co-administration could lead to an hyperserotonergic syndrome because of the agonistic activity of these two substances on the serotoninergic system: in fact, MAOI activity causes an increasing exposure to the parent drug (5-MeO-DMT) and to the active metabolite (bufotenine), originating a possible fatal toxicity (Fig. <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref></bold>).</p><p>In his self-experiments, Ott, revealed that after insufflation [<xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>], 5-MeO-DMT caused visionary and auditory changes, with a distortion of the perception of time. The onset of these effects was after 3-4 minutes from the administration, the peak was reached after about 35-40 minutes and they lasting until 60-70 minutes. He demonstrated also that oral ingestion compared with intranasal or sublingual ingestion of 30-35 mg of 5-MeO-DMT produced limited effects or could produce no psychoactive effects at all.</p><p>
<bold><underline>5-methoxy-diisopropyltryptamine</underline></bold> (5-MeO-DiPT), or &#x0201c;Foxy Methoxy&#x0201d;, produced by the addition of two isopropyl groups to the terminal nitrogen of the aminoethyl group, and methoxylation of the 5-position of the indole ring, is a synthetic designer drug which was first synthesized and described by Shulgin. </p><p>Sogawa &#x0201c;investigated the actions of 5-MeO-DiPT against monoamine neurotransmitter transporters, using COS-7 cells heterologously expressing these transporters and rat brain synaptosomes&#x0201d;, and demonstrated that &#x0201c;5-MeO-DiPT acts as a competitive serotonin transporter (SERT) inhibitor and has an inability to cause reverse transport, underlying its serotonergic actions&#x0201d; [<xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Agonistic activity at serotonin receptors could lead to permanent damages to serotonergic neurons with neuropsychiatric implications [<xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Fantegrossi reported also that &#x0201c;5-MeO-DiPT had affinity for receptors relevant to hallucinogenic effects&#x0201d; observed <italic>in vivo</italic>, and that the psychotropic activity of 5-MeO-DiPT might therefore be caused by its association with post-synaptic 5-HT receptors [<xref rid="R61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. In human biological samples, such as blood and urine, 5-MeO-DiPT is mainly metabolized in 5-hydroxy-<italic>N</italic>,<italic>N</italic>-diisopropyltryptamine (5-OH-DiPT) and in 5-methoxy-N-isopropyltryptamine (5-MeO-NiPT) [<xref rid="R62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. 5-MeO-DiPT is orally active, and dosages between 6&#x02013;12 mg are reported by Shulgin, but it can be also smoked, or snorted. Its onset of action is in 20 to 30 minutes, and its effects last from 3 to 6 hours. The users experienced euphoria, disinhibition, increased sociability, visual and auditory hallucinations, feeling of love but also less desiderable effects like myoclonus, restlessness, insomnia and anxiety, as well as emotional distress like nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. </p><p>
<bold><underline>5-methoxy-N,N-diallyltryptamine</underline></bold> (5-MeO-DALT) was first synthesized by Shulgin and although information on this tryptamine was available since 2004, &#x0201c;its use as hallucinogenic drug has been reported only occasionally in on-line fora&#x0201d; [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. According to the European Database on New Drugs (EDND), it was first sequestered as two grey tablets, in 2006 at Helsinki airport [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].

Moreover, it did not show effect on dopamine, serotonin and norepinephrine re-uptake and presented a slight monoamine-releasing activity [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. 5-MeO-DALT is mainly found in powder form that is taken orally or nasally. The range of doses and effects is unusually broad. Shulgin reported dosages for oral administration from 12 to 25 mg: users reported that the onset of its effects was within 15 minutes, the peak was reached in 30 minutes and the main effects lasted for 2-4 hours, including euphoria, visual hallucinations, walking difficulties, and &#x02018;out of body&#x02019; experiences.</p><p>

So the only evidences that have an epidemiological significance derive from arrests and seizures by law enforcement agencies [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], from the numbers of enquires to poisons centers, from the reports of the emergency departments or from admissions to hospital. Unfortunately, the limited number of these official reports may underestimate the true extent of the problem [<xref rid="R80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]: statistics on deaths may also be available, but often these publications do not provide information on toxicity or mode of action of these substances as completely lacks the analytical confirmation of the agents involved, and the causes of death are ascertained or through the testimonies of family members and friends, or after the discovery of the substance at home or in the clothes of the deceased. Nevertheless, in scientific literature are reported a consistent number of cases of acute poisoning due to the increasingly widespread use of these new psychoactive substances: many of these are the result of emergency room experience. As the amount of tryptamines necessary to cause psychotropic effects is minimal, and the interval of occurrence of effects is rather delayed [<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], there is a risk of inappropriate new assumptions, that could lead to poisoning or overdose.</p><p>Holstege reported the case of poisoning of a college student (male, 21 years old) came in E.D. after ingestion of 270 mg of AMT purchased on the internet [<xref rid="R81" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>].

He denied taking any other recreational drug or alcohol. He had a blood pressure of 122/56 mm Hg, with 106 pulses and a respiration rate of 20. His pupils were equal and reactive with intact extra ocular movements and there was no motor sensory deficit. His cardiorespiratory examination was unremarkable. The patient received medical support until the symptoms did not disappear, about 3.5 hours after ingestion, then he was discharged from hospital. The toxicological analysis performed on the urine sample did not show presence of alcohol, but the immunoassay screening test was positive to cannabinoids and opiates: these results were, then, confirmed by GC/MS analysis. Acetaminophen and caffeine were detected in the acid-neutral drug screen performed with GC/MS. The GC/MS basic drug screen, indeed, revealed a large 5-MeO-DiPT peak, codeine, nicotine, cotinine, acetaminophen, caffeine, and two other peaks that were assumed to be 5-MeO-DiPT metabolites.

The patient referred only sleep irregularities: he reported that, to solve his sleep disturbance, decided to take a drug without professional consultation. Although he did not know in depth the chemical and physical characteristics of methylone, he believed it could help feel him free from insomnia. Then, he bought on the Internet, the drug 1 g as pure methylone powder: but, toxicological analysis performed on the substance indicated that drug was composed of about 60% methylone (120 mg) and 38% 5-MeO-MiPT (76 mg). He took approximately 200 mg of the drug powder by oral administration and thirty minutes later, he started to feel nausea and sick in the stomach.

The case in Miami, involved a 22 years old college student who found deceased, about 12 hours after he confided to his roommate he was "taking hallucinating drugs" and he was able to "discover the secret of the universe". The roommate reported that he was shaking and sweating profusely, waving a knife, and threatening to commit suicide. The roommate tied him to the bed for his own protection and left him to "sleep it off". Approximately 12 h later, the roommate discovered the man lying in bed unresponsive. From the scene was recovered an empty 1-g vial of AMT. Immunoassay analysis of urine and gastric contents performed with enzyme immunoassay technique were positive for amphetamines and the basic drug blood screen performed with GC/MS detected a small peak, later identified as AMT. Volatile substances were screened using headspace gas chromatography (GC/HS). Postmortem toxicological analysis performed on iliac vein blood, gastric contents, liver and brain revealed the presence of AMT in the following concentrations (Table <bold><xref ref-type="table" rid="T9">9</xref></bold>) [<xref rid="R92" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>, <xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr"> 48</xref>].</p><p>Several deaths have been attributed to AET (&#x003b1;-ethyltryptamine) assumption: this compound, strictly related to &#x003b1;-methyltryptamine, has psychedelic, stimulant, and entactogenic effects.

The articles, reporting cases of death related to intake of these substances, showed the need of more effective policies to promote timely exchange of information. Internet is &#x0201c;a growing source of on-line drug trafficking&#x0201d;: products purchased on Internet may vary over time proposing chemicals always different, not listed in literature, meaning that users are often unaware of what or how much they are taking, causing increasing risks to public health. For this reason information from Internet, together with results of analysis of substances seized from law enforcement agencies and reports of cases of death related to intake of these substances, organized in the way we proposed in this review, provides an effective tool for specialists facing this emerging threat to public health and public security, not only forensic scientists but also the personnel working in Emergency Departments. </p></sec><sec><title>CONFLICT OF INTEREST</title><p>The authors confirm that this article content has no conflict of interest.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>Declared none.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="R1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="webpage"><source>Available from <uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.unodc.org/documents/scientific/NPS_2013_SMART.pdf">http://www.unodc.org/documents/scientific/NPS_2013_SMART.pdf</uri></source><year>2014</year><date-in-citation>Last access on 24th August</date-in-citation></element-citation></ref><ref id="R2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Zuba</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Identification of cathinones and other active components of &#x0201c;legal highs&#x0201d; by mass spectrometric methods</article-title><source>TrAC</source><year>2012</year><volume>32</volume><fpage>15</fpage><lpage>30</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1016/j.trac.2011.09.009</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="R3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Musselman</surname><given-names>M.E</given-names></name><name><surname>Hampton</surname><given-names>J.P</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>&#x0201c;Not for human consumption&#x0201d;: a review of emerging designer drugs</article-title><source>Pharmacotherapy</source><year>2014</year><volume>34</volume><issue>7</issue><fpage>745</fpage><lpage>757</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1002/phar.1424</pub-id><?supplied-pmid 24710806?><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">24710806</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="R4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Davies</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Wood</surname><given-names>D.M</given-names></name><name><surname>Smith</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Button</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Ramsey</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Archer</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Holt</surname><given-names>D.W</given-names></name><name><surname>Dargan</surname><given-names>P.I</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Purchasing &#x02018;legal highs&#x02019; on the Internet--is there consistency in what you get?</article-title><source>QJM</source><year>2010</year><volume>103</volume><issue>7</issue><fpage>489</fpage><lpage>493</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1093/qjmed/hcq056</pub-id><?supplied-pmid 20413562?><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">20413562</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="R5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Arnold</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The new danger of synthetic drugs</article-title><source>Lancet</source><year>2013</year><volume>382</volume><issue>9886</issue><fpage>15</fpage><lpage>16</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1016/S0140-6736(13)61512-3</pub-id><?supplied-pmid 23841151?><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">23841151</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="R6"><label>6</label><element-citation publication-type="webpage"><source>Available from <uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/119139/acmdnps2011.pdf">https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/119139/acmdnps2011.pdf</uri></source><year>2014</year><date-in-citation>Last access on 24th July</date-in-citation></element-citation></ref><ref id="R7"><label>7</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Brandt</surname><given-names>S.D</given-names></name><name><surname>Freeman</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>McGagh</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Abdul-Halim</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name><name><surname>Alder</surname><given-names>J.F</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>An analytical perspective on favoured synthetic routes to the psychoactive tryptamines</article-title><source>J.

"I inhaled several hits from my vaporizer and sat back. I felt head-pressure and uneasiness, then suddenly I became very fast. My mind was moving fast, and my body was speeding along with it in an unconscious way. Several hours into it, I began to notice more of a psychedelic effect beginning to manifest. It seemed as if the speedy part was becoming less predominant and the psychedelic visual effects were starting to kick in. I went back to my room to watch the distinctive waves of a soft red/orange visuals They were similar to colors of LSD. It gradually increased to a level of intensity, and after several more hours it was clear that I had reached the plateau. Feeling fairly tired and ready for bed, I decided to call it a night. Quite to my surprise, when I awoke four hours later I was at the same level as when I went to sleep.

After the peak, as I was slowly coming down, I was aware of feeling slightly depressed. This state continued until I achieved baseline, but was not severe enough to prevent me from participating in the general good spirits of the group. There is a real possibility that my weekly use of MDMA for writing might have built up a tolerance to the stimulation of this material. I think that that may be close to the answer. Would I take it again? Not with much enthusiasm. It didn't give enough exciting rewards."<break/>
"A strong feeling of being-at-peace was evident in an hour, although there was some concentration required to do things in a coordinated way. I wouldn't want to drive a car. There seemed to be very easy drifting of thoughts but no visuals or sensory distortions. There were no GI disturbances anywhere along the line except for some loose stools the next morning. Appetite was slightly depressed, but food tasted very good. A very slight tremor could be detected in the fingers around the peak of the experience. There was a desire to talk with friends somewhat reminiscent of MDMA; I am sure that this drug could be quite a social-enhancing material. The effects wore off gradually and were essentially gone by the six hour point. Sleep was unaffected, however the next morning there was a slight feeling of dullness and possibly hang-over which quickly wore off."</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><table-wrap id="T4" position="float"><label>Table 4</label><caption><p>Routes of administration of DMT and its principal psychoactive experiences as reported on <uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.erowid.org">http://www.erowid.org</uri> [<xref rid="R71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>].</p></caption><table frame="border" rules="all" width="100%"><thead><tr><th colspan="3" rowspan="1">DMT EXPERIENCES</th></tr><tr><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Route of Administration</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Dosage</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Effects (up to 1 Hour)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Oral (&#x0003e;350 mg)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">up to 350 mg</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x0201c;Completely without effect either physiological or psychological&#x0201d;</td></tr><tr><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Intramuscularly (60-100 mg)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">with 80 mg</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x0201c;My perceptual distortions were visual in nature and with my eyes closed I could see colored patterns, primarily geometrical patterns moving very fast, having sometimes very deep emotional content and connotation.
