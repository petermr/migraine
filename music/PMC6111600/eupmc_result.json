    "While pediatric integrative medicine (PIM) emphasizes an \"evidence-based practice using multiple therapeutic modalities\"; paradoxically, literature reviews examining the prevalence and/or efficacy of such mind‚Åªbody approaches often address PIM modalities separately. Such contributions are relevant, yet documentation of how to deliver combined complementary approaches in children and youth are scarce. Nevertheless, integrative practitioners in clinical practice routinely mix approaches to meet the individual needs of each patient. Best practices are flexible, and include blending and augmenting services within the same session, and/or connecting modalities sequentially for an incremental effect, and/or referring to outside resources for additional interventions. Resonating with integrative medicine's definition, this article's goal is to demonstrate paradigms that \"bring together complementary approaches in a coordinated way within clinical practice\" by linking clinical hypnosis, the trail-blazer modality in PIM's history, with mindfulness, biofeedback, acupuncture, and yoga. Following the consideration of the overlap of guided imagery with hypnosis and an abridged literature report, this clinical perspective considers the selection of modalities within a collaborative relationship with the child/teen and parents, emphasizing goodness-of-fit with patients' contexts, e.g., symptoms, resources, interests, goals, and developmental stage. Case vignettes illustrate practical strategies for mixing approaches."
