Abstract</div> <p>Advances in biophysics, biology, functional genomics, neuroscience, psychology, psychoneuroimmunology, and other fields suggest the existence of a subtle system of "biofield" interactions that organize biological processes from the subatomic, atomic, molecular, cellular, and organismic to the interpersonal and cosmic levels. Biofield interactions may bring about regulation of biochemical, cellular, and neurological processes through means related to electromagnetism, quantum fields, and perhaps other means of modulating biological activity and information flow. The biofield paradigm, in contrast to a reductionist, chemistry-centered viewpoint, emphasizes the informational content of biological processes; biofield interactions are thought to operate in part via low-energy or "subtle" processes such as weak, nonthermal electromagnetic fields (EMFs) or processes potentially related to consciousness and nonlocality. Biofield interactions may also operate through or be reflected in more well-understood informational processes found in electroencephalographic (EEG) and electrocardiographic (ECG) data. Recent advances have led to the development of a wide variety of therapeutic and diagnostic biofield devices, defined as physical instruments best understood from the viewpoint of a biofield paradigm. Here, we provide a broad overview of biofield devices, with emphasis on those devices for which solid, peer-reviewed evidence exists. A subset of these devices, such as those based upon EEG- and ECG-based heart rate variability, function via mechanisms that are well understood and are widely employed in clinical settings. Other device modalities, such a gas discharge visualization and biophoton emission, appear to operate through incompletely understood mechanisms and have unclear clinical significance. Device modes of operation include EMF-light, EMF-heat, EMF-nonthermal, electrical current, vibration and sound, physical and mechanical, intentionality and nonlocality, gas and plasma, and other (mode of operation not well-understood). Methodological issues in device development and interfaces for future interdisciplinary research are discussed. Devices play prominent cultural and scientific roles in our society, and it is likely that device technologies will be one of the most influential access points for the furthering of biofield research and the dissemination of biofield concepts. This developing field of study presents new areas of research that have many important implications for both basic science and clinical medicine. </p> </div> <div class="kwd-group"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

INTRODUCTION</div> <p>Developments in several fields of research, including biophysics, biology, functional genomics, metabolomics, neuroscience, psychology, and psychoneuroimmunology have advanced our understanding of the interrelatedness of these disciplines from the level of basic biological processes to a dynamic systems or "biofield" level. These recent advances have also shown that emotional states, intention, stress, and other psychosocial factors can significantly affect biological function and health outcomes. <a href="#R1"> <sup>1</sup> </a> <sup>–</sup> <a href="#R7"> <sup>7</sup> </a> Molecular, cellular, and organismic function and regulation are thus interwoven with and can be influenced by emotion, cognition, and psychosocial factors, suggesting the existence of a "subtle"—ie, low-energy system of biofield—interactions connecting these activities. </p> <p>Here, we define the term <i>biofield</i> as "an organizing principle for the dynamic information flow that regulates biological function and homeostasis." Biofield interactions can organize spatiotemporal biological processes across hierarchical subtle and gross levels: from the subatomic, atomic, molecular, cellular, and organismic to the interpersonal and cosmic levels. As such, biofield interactions can influence and be influenced by a variety of biological pathways, including biochemical, cellular, and neurological processes related to electromagnetism, correlated quantum information flow, and perhaps other means for modulating activity and information flow across multiple levels of biology. </p> <p>Biofield devices comprise physical instruments that may be most clearly understood from the viewpoint of a biofield paradigm, and a large and diverse number of devices have been developed to measure or manipulate biofield interactions. These include both diagnostic devices (to measure biofield properties) and therapeutic devices (to manipulate biofield interactions). The study of biofield devices is at a nascent stage of development, and much further research is needed to determine clinical efficacy and elucidate the underlying mechanisms of action for many of the devices mentioned here. Thus the purpose of this work is to provide an overview of those devices that we judge to be promising enough to warrant further investigation rather than to provide a critical review. We believe a critical review is warranted but out of the scope of this paper. </p> <p>The biofield devices summarized here operate through a variety of modalities rather than a single mechanism. Some biofield devices function through well-understood mechanisms and are already widely used in clinical settings: for example, electroencephalography (EEG)- and electrocardiography (ECG)-based heart rate variability (HRV). Other devices appear to operate through mechanisms that are novel or incompletely understood. However, all of these devices share a common property: rather than functioning primarily in a reductionist, chemistry-centered manner, biofield devices function via the informational content of biological processes and can interact via low-energy or "subtle" processes, including those potentially related to consciousness and nonlocality. <a href="#R8"> <sup>8</sup> </a> <sup>,</sup> <a href="#R9"> <sup>9</sup> </a> </p> </div> <div class="biofielddevices" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
BIOFIELD DEVICES</div> <p>Here we provide a brief overview of the broad categories of biofield devices, with the goal being to stimulate further discussion and research. It is out of the scope of this overview to assess the efficacy of particular devices. Rather, we describe those devices for which we deemed that sufficient evidence exists to warrant mention. In order to manage this task in a manuscript of reasonable length, we chose to focus upon devices for which peer-reviewed scientific reports suggesting efficacy are available rather than conference proceedings or manufacturers' white papers. However, in the few cases that specific devices with sufficient promise and relevance lacked a peer-reviewed basis, we have presented whatever evidence was available. Here, devices are organized according to mode of operation and these modalities include electromagnetic field (EMF)-light, EMF-heat, EMF-nonthermal, electrical current, vibration and sound, physical and mechanical, intentionality and nonlocality, gas and plasma, and other (mode of operation not well understood). </p> <div class="modalitiesusingelectromagneticfields:light" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Modalities Using Electromagnetic Fields: Light</div> <p>One line of research that has yielded a large amount of information on biofield activity is the study of biophoton emission (BE), also called ultraweak photon emission. BE is the spontaneous emission of light which emanates from all living organisms, including humans. <a href="#R10"> <sup>10</sup> </a> Several studies have reported intercellular BE signaling, <a href="#R11"> <sup>11</sup> </a> and it has been suggested that such signaling by coherent biophotons could explain many regulatory functions, <a href="#R12"> <sup>12</sup> </a> including cellular orientation detection, <a href="#R13"> <sup>13</sup> </a> biophoton-regulation of neurotransmitter release, <a href="#R14"> <sup>14</sup> </a> leukocyte respiratory activity, <a href="#R15"> <sup>15</sup> </a> and enhanced seed germination. <a href="#R16"> <sup>16</sup> </a> A systematic review has suggested that detection of BE may be useful as a medical diagnostic approach and as a research tool. <a href="#R17"> <sup>17</sup> </a> </p> <p>The body also exhibits sensitivity to exogenous light exposure, and numerous phototherapies use visible light to treat seasonal affective disorder, <a href="#R18"> <sup>18</sup> </a> vitamin D deficiency, <a href="#R19"> <sup>19</sup> </a> and a variety of skin conditions. <a href="#R20"> <sup>20</sup> </a> <sup>–</sup> <a href="#R24"> <sup>24</sup> </a> Infrared light has been used therapeutically for wound <a href="#R25"> <sup>25</sup> </a> and bone <a href="#R26"> <sup>26</sup> </a> repair. Laser therapy (LT) is another form of phototherapy that is now employed for a wide variety of clinical applications. <a href="#R27"> <sup>27</sup> </a> Low-level laser therapy (LLLT), which acts without ablating tissue, has been extensively studied, producing a growing body of systematic reviews supporting efficacy of LLLT for several pathologies <a href="#R27"> <sup>27</sup> </a> including skeletal muscle repair, <a href="#R28"> <sup>28</sup> </a> tendinopathy, <a href="#R29"> <sup>29</sup> </a> rheumatoid arthritis, <a href="#R30"> <sup>30</sup> </a> osteoarthritis, <a href="#R31"> <sup>31</sup> </a> neck pain, <a href="#R32"> <sup>32</sup> </a> chronic joint disorders, <a href="#R33"> <sup>33</sup> </a> and traumatic brain injury. <a href="#R34"> <sup>34</sup> </a> Nonthermal LLLT appears to involve cytochrome c oxidase as the photoacceptor, <a href="#R35"> <sup>35</sup> </a> further elucidating one instance in which the informational content of subtle low-energy light-signaling may be more important than the physical energy of the input signal. </p> </div> <div class="modalitiesusingelectromagneticfields:heat" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

DISCUSSION</div> <p>Although the biofield devices described here operate through a great diversity of mechanisms, these devices all share the common quality of being most clearly understood within a biofield framework, wherein information flow or the capacity to create organization acts across hierarchical levels to coordinate biological activity. Elements of this framework are already well accepted by the biomedical community and have been applied through several device modalities, including ECG, EEG, other electrophysiological techniques, some EMF therapies, ultrasound, thermal imaging, and techniques using light like LT. Extraordinary medical and scientific progress has occurred as a result of these modalities and the elucidation of their underlying principles. Further progress is likely to be informed by the recent demonstration of endogenous EMF regulation of a variety of biological processes and indications of quantum information processing in the cytoskeleton. <a href="#R48"> <sup>48</sup> </a> <sup>–</sup> <a href="#R52"> <sup>52</sup> </a> <sup>,</sup> <a href="#R54"> <sup>54</sup> </a> <sup>,</sup> <a href="#R169"> <sup>169</sup> </a> These recent results suggest a biophysical basis for biofield coordination of activities across the molecular, cellular, and organismic levels <a href="#R53"> <sup>53</sup> </a> and may provide testable hypotheses regarding biofield regulation of homeodynamics and mind-body interactions. </p> <p>In contrast to this growing knowledge of biofield mechanisms, several biofield modalities appear to operate according to principles that are not currently well understood or accepted by mainstream medical science. Further study of those modalities for which there is strong experimental evidence—eg, BE, consciousness and nonlocal interactions, GDV, TCM—may substantially advance our understanding of biofield interactions and their biological and health implications. <a href="#R57"> <sup>57</sup> </a> The growing basic science data and existence of devices operating via consciousness or intention, <a href="#R8"> <sup>8</sup> </a> <sup>,</sup> <a href="#R9"> <sup>9</sup> </a> which may act through nonlocal quantum correlations, must be taken seriously. Despite long-lasting taboos proscribing study of these phenomena, researchers must have the courage and self-awareness necessary to assess the veracity, specific properties, and general significance of the large and important body of research in this area. </p> <p>The large diversity of biofield device modalities presents several significant methodological issues not limited to the fact that biofield interactions appear to involve exceedingly complex systems. Attempts to reduce biofield interactions to reductionist substrates may be inadequate, underscoring the need for a more holistic "systems biology" approach. <a href="#R170"> <sup>170</sup> </a> Significantly, several of the modalities described here, such as BEs and extremely weak EMFs, operate at extremely low interaction energies, often below the apparent thermal threshold of Brownian motion. <a href="#R56"> <sup>56</sup> </a> Such low energies suggest the existence of weak-field information transfer or subtle signaling, for which the biological mechanisms are only now becoming elucidated. While the existence of extremely weak EMF effects is now beyond dispute, <a href="#R56"> <sup>56</sup> </a> understanding of the clinical relevance of specific nonthermal waveforms is still in its infancy, and a more comprehensive model of the resonant response of the body to particular weak EMF signaling is still needed. Furthermore, the significance of these EMF effects is unclear when juxtaposed with the variety of EMFs that many individuals are exposed to in the course of everyday life. </p> <p>In order to determine which biological processes exhibit functional sensitivities to these subtle factors, researchers will have to carefully control for the influence of very weak EMFs and other low-energy subtle influences. Therein, specialized equipment and laboratories will be required, including the use of Faraday cages, [.proportional]-metal enclosures, completely dark rooms, noise-proofing, and the development of instruments sensitive enough to measure biofield interactions or subtle low-energy nonthermal influences. Nearly all cell culture incubators produce a nonuniform EMF of bioactive strength, which must be taken into consideration. <a href="#R56"> <sup>56</sup> </a> Controlling for picotesla-nanotesla range sensitivities <a href="#R57"> <sup>57</sup> </a> presents further challenges, as shielding at these extremely low field strengths may be difficult or impossible in some situations. In the absence of a means to control for all potential subtle effectors, it may, in some instances, be necessary to adopt a new paradigm of research wherein naturally occurring EMF fluctuations due to solar/geomagnetic and other sources are an integral part of the experimental environment and are therein measured and accounted for in analyses. Similarly, circadian and other naturally occurring biological rhythms may influence very sensitive systems. These factors may be precursors of a shift towards an information-based model of low-energy interactions, wherein the informational content of a process may be much more relevant than the apparent energy of interaction. </p> <div class="interfacesforfutureresearch" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Interfaces for Future Research</div> <p>Biofield studies are now evolving toward being an accepted discipline within mainstream science, and the existence of a community or several related groups focused on biofield research will greatly enhance the visibility and credibility of the field as a whole. To further the development of knowledge in the next decade, we propose the creation of an organization or community of researchers dedicated to furthering biofield studies and device development. Regular opportunities for interaction and critical assessment of progress and results will enhance the growth of knowledge related to this emerging field. A collaborative community will also enable the independent replication of key findings. This will be critical for achieving acceptance by the scientific community at large. </p> <p>Another important goal will be to acquire funding for independent replications or concurrent experimental protocols in separate laboratories. Private sources of funding are necessary to perform research today, and this often results in conflicts of interest. For example, device manufacturers provide a substantial portion of the funding for research in EMF therapeutics. Research in this emerging and sometimes controversial field, which is moving toward advances in science, illustrates how such conflicts of interest could significantly hinder acceptance by the mainstream scientific community. Efforts could be made to form collaborations amongst device manufacturers to replicate findings and make distinctions between similar devices. Although this may appear to run contrary to the shortterm goals of individual companies, the long-term benefits may be substantial. </p> <p>In order to further the progress of biofield research and device development, research must be coordinated across several levels. Further developments of diagnostic and therapeutic biofield device technologies will require interdisciplinary research joining clinical and preclinical studies with basic science efforts in physiology, biophysics, and the development of a theory of mind and nonlocal consciousness in the following areas. </p> <div class="basicsciencefoundations:physiology,biophysics,andtheoryofmind/consciousness" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Basic Science Foundations: Physiology, Biophysics, and Theory of Mind/Consciousness</div> <p>Interfaces among these 3 fields are crucial for the development and refinement of biofield device technologies. A better understanding of the physiology of biofield interactions (ie, biofield reception, generation, and function) will require interfaces with biophysics and new models for subtle biological influences such as extremely weak EMF effects or biophotonics. A more comprehensive theory of mind is required to understand nonlocal interactions and to further understand the biophysical bases for these effects. At this stage, models based upon quantum correlations appear promising, <a href="#R54"> <sup>54</sup> </a> <sup>,</sup> <a href="#R169"> <sup>169</sup> </a> but testable hypotheses are needed in order to develop a more detailed functional framework.

CONCLUSIONS</div> <p>The current existence of biofield devices is a demonstration of the clear, specific, and tangible knowledge that has been gained thus far in biofield science. Devices play prominent cultural and scientific roles in our society, and it is likely that device technologies will be one of the most influential access points for the furthering of biofield research and the dissemination of biofield concepts. Comprehensive study of biofield devices will require a concerted research effort, interdisciplinary collaborations, and sufficient funding. Systematic studies are needed to deepen our understanding of the nature of biofield interactions and to move biofield device development and experimentation forward. This developing field of study presents new areas of research that have many important implications for basic science, clinical medicine, and potentially, the forward progress and evolution of our species. The ever-growing understanding of biofield science holds promise to foster a more humane and personalized form of medicine and an expansion of our scientific viewpoint to include the importance of each individual's interconnectedness with communities, the immediate environment, the earth, and the cosmos. </p> </div> </div> <div class="back" title="back"> <div class="references">
