The use of CAM in children with common neurologic diseases is more frequent than its use in healthy children (24%&#x02013;78% vs. 12%). However, less than half of patients report such use to their physicians. The preferred modalities of CAM vary in different countries due to their different cultures and traditions. The most common factor significantly associated with the use of CAM is parental CAM use in most studies. The frequency of the use of CAM in children and adults with neurologic diseases is similar, and both rates are higher than the rates in those without these conditions. The preferred modalities of CAM in adults are diverse, and megavitamins and mind/body therapy (prayer and chiropractic care) are included. The most common factor significantly associated with the use of CAM in adults with neurologic diseases is high educational level.

They also reported that 40% (n=75) of children with chronic health conditions used CAM in the UK, and this proportion is much higher than that in healthy children<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3)</xref>. In the study by Barnes et al.<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9)</xref>, the most common modalities used were natural products (neither vitamin nor mineral) and osteopathic or chiropractic manipulation. Regarding significant factors, parental use of CAM was associated with CAM use in children compared to children whose parents did not use CAM (24% vs. 5%). Parental use of CAM was also found to be a strongly associated factor in a study by Birdee et al.<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11)</xref>. Additionally, for both adults and children, worry about cost was found to be one of the factors related to the use of CAM and delaying using conventional medicine, and patients were more likely to use CAM when expenses were a concern than when expenses were not a problem for conventional medicine<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9)</xref>. Other factors significantly associated with pediatric use of CAM, in the study of Birdee et al.<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11)</xref>, were adolescent age rather than that of toddler or infant, parent with a college education, more frequent use of prescription medication, stress or anxiety, musculoskeletal conditions, dermatologic conditions, and sinus infection.</p><sec><title>1. Characteristics of the use of CAM in children with neurologic diseases</title><p>In a recent study on patterns of CAM use in pediatric patients with common neurologic conditions (headaches, migraines, seizures), pediatric patients with common neurological conditions were found to use CAM significantly more compared to children without these conditions (24% [n=586] vs.13% [n=7,083])<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7)</xref>. Pediatric patients with neurologic conditions used biological therapies with a similar frequency and mind/body practices with a significantly higher frequency compared to other pediatric patients using CAM. Among mind/body practices, deep breathing was used most commonly (33%), meditation was used in 15%, and progressive relaxation was employed in 10%<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7)</xref>. In another study in 2010 in North Jordan, 56% of children (n=176) with neurologic illnesses used CAM for their care<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2)</xref>. Regarding the most commonly used methods, prayer/reciting the Quran was used in 77%, massage with olive oil in 32%, religious healers in 30%, and consumption of honey products in 29%. Among the reasons provided for the use of CAM, religious beliefs were the most common (68%), and no patients described distrust in conventional medicine<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2)</xref>. Other significant factors connected to the use of CAM included belief in its effects, speech delay, father's age greater than 30 years, and mother's education less than high school<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2)</xref>. Additionally, parents' experience or hearing of successful cases from acquaintances or mass media was found to be other reasons for using CAM<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8)</xref>. Side effects were rare<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8)</xref>. In a study by Soo et al.<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8)</xref> regarding the use of CAM in a pediatric neurology clinic, 44% of patients (n=105) were found to use CAM. In regard to the most commonly used CAM modalities, chiropractic manipulation was used in 15%, dietary therapy was used in 12%, and homeopathy, herbal remedies, and prayer healing were each used in 8%. The difference in this study compared to other studies is that the parents' sociodemographic characteristics were not significantly associated with the use of CAM. Pediatric health-related quality of life was also not a significant factor<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8)</xref>. In total, 59% of patients who used CAM experienced benefits. The total median cost of CAM compared with conventional medicines was not different ($31.70 vs. $50.00 per month)<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8)</xref>. In a study on CAM use in pediatric neurology, the overall rates of CAM use at two centers were 78% (n=151) and 48% (n=55), respectively<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6)</xref>. As for the most commonly used CAM products, multivitamins were used in 84%, vitamin C was used in 37%, homeopathic remedies were used in 24%, and fish oil/omega-3s were employed in 22%<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6)</xref>. Regarding the most commonly used CAM practices, massage was used in 47%, and 37% used chiropractic methods, 18% used faith-healing, and aromatherapy, homeopathy, and relaxation were each used in 16%<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6)</xref>. Over half of patients disclosed to their physicians their use of CAM in addition to conventional medicine<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6)</xref>.</p><p>In a study examining the use of traditional herbal medicines in Korean elementary school children, 65% (n=905) of children were found to be taking herbal medicines<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12)</xref>. In a 2008 study in Korea, 65 of 378 children (17%) with epilepsy were found to be taking herbal medicines<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4)</xref>. In our study in 2014, 19% (n=398) of children with epilepsy used traditional Korean medicine (TKM) (acupuncture, moxibustion, herbal medicine)<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10)</xref>. These results suggest that TKM is not the favored method for attaining seizure control and that patients are careful about using TKM to treat epilepsy. In addition, 60% of children with epilepsy were receiving other types of CAM<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10)</xref>. According to a study by Lee et al.<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4)</xref>, patients with psychosomatic disorders used herbal medicine significantly more frequently, whereas in a study by Kim et al.<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13)</xref>, neurologically normal patients used it slightly more frequently; however, the difference did not have statistical significance. In our study, among receivers of combination treatments besides TKM, TKM was used more frequently in those receiving language, music, or art therapy than in those undergoing physiotherapy or other combination therapies<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10)</xref>. This finding suggests that the use of TKM is associated more with the purpose of treatment of cognitive function than motor functions, and parents of children with epilepsy may believe that TKM has an effect on the former rather than the latter<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10)</xref>. Additionally, regarding significant factors, in the group of patients using a greater number of antiepileptic drugs and having low seizure-free rates, the use of TKM was more frequent<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10)</xref>.</p><p>Regarding the effect of CAM on epilepsy, inconsistent results had been reported in previous studies. Recent Cochrane reviews show that some studies on the use of acupuncture and Chinese traditional herbal medicine did not succeed in providing clear evidence proving the effects of acupuncture and herbal medicine for epilepsy patients<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15)</xref>. According to the study by Lee et al.<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4)</xref>, 18% of respondents using herbal medicine reported its effectiveness for seizure control, but the rest of the respondents reported no effectiveness or even worsening of symptoms, although many patients (33%) agreed with using herbal medicine. It was also reported that most patients did not feel that CAM was superior to general epilepsy treatments, although 32% of them continued using CAM<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16)</xref>. It is presumed that this persistent usage is due to people's beliefs that herbal medicines are safe (not dangerous) and help to improve health and enhance cognitive function<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10)</xref>. In spite of these beliefs, however, according to the report of Kuan et al.<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16)</xref>, the most frequent adverse effect of CAM was aggravated seizures. It is presumed that this is due to the effects of seizure-inducing materials of herbal medicine or drug-drug interactions. Regarding the frequency of CAM use for epileptic patients in various countries, 49% (n=403) of Taiwanese were found to use CAM, 44% used it in Arizona, 37% (n=265) of Nigerians used CAM, and 32% (n=1,000) in India and 24% (n=92) in Ohio used CAM<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19)</xref>. Regarding commonly used forms of CAM for treatment of epileptic patients, prayer and stress relief were used in the West, whereas traditional herbal medicines were employed both in the East and in Africa<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19)</xref>. In US, the preferred modalities were biological therapies and mind-body practices<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7)</xref>.</p><p>In Canada, the commonly used methods were chiropractic manipulations, dietary therapy, multivitamins, and massage<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8)</xref>. However, in North Jordan, prayer/reciting the Quran was the most commonly used modality<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2)</xref>. In Korea, TKM was used commonly by neurologic patients. These differences in use of CAM between countries may be owing to their different cultures, religions, and traditions<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10)</xref>. The characteristics of the use of CAM in children with neurologic diseases are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>.</p></sec><sec><title>2. Characteristics of the use of CAM in adults with common neurologic conditions</title><p>According to the study by Barnes et al.<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9)</xref>, almost 40% (n=23,393) of US adults used CAM in 2007 and the most commonly used modalities were natural products (neither vitamin nor mineral) (18%) and deep breathing exercises (13%.). CAM was used more frequently in American adults with common neurological conditions (migraines, regular headaches, strokes, back pain with sciatica, seizures, dementia or memory loss) than in those without such conditions (44% [n=6,587] vs. 33% [n=16,806])<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20)</xref>. The frequency of use of each CAM modality was higher in adults with common neurological conditions than in those without<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20)</xref>. The most common modalities were mind/body therapies, and the least common were alternative medical systems<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20)</xref>. The reasons why those with common neurological conditions used CAM more frequently than those without such conditions included provider's recommendations or little effect achieved with conventional medicine or a cost that was too high<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20)</xref>. About 50% of adults with common neurological conditions did not report their use of CAM to their doctors<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20)</xref>. Factors that significantly influenced the use of CAM in those with common neurological conditions included higher educational level than high school education, positive history of anxiety, living in a western area, being a former smoker, and drinking alcohol lightly<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20)</xref>.</p><p>In the previous studies on the use of CAM in various neurologic conditions, the prevalence of use of CAM ranged from 19% to 43%<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23)</xref>. Compared to the frequency of use of CAM in children with common neurologic diseases, the frequency of use in adults with neurologic diseases was similar<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10)</xref>. For Korean adults with other diseases, several studies showed the following findings regarding CAM use: 60%&#x02013;70% of patients with stroke used CAM, 53% of those with cancer used it and 53% of patients with asthma and 48% of patients with psychiatric disorders used herbal medicines<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27)</xref>.</p><p>Preferred modalities of CAM use in children and adults had diverse features, and these results may be influenced by individuals' different cultures and traditions of use of CAM. The factor most commonly related to use of CAM in children with neurologic conditions was parental CAM use, and it could be presumed that the use of CAM in children may be due to such usage running in the family, as well as belief in or experience with the efficacy of CAM. In adults with neurologic conditions, increased educational level was the most common factor associated with use of CAM<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23)</xref>, and this result may relate to economic level. Characteristics of the use of CAM in adults with neurologic diseases are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>.</p></sec><sec><title>3. The use of CAM in children with other chronic diseases</title><p>In a systematic review on the use of CAM in pediatric cancer patients, the prevalence of use of CAM (since the diagnosis of cancer) ranged from 6% to 91% (n=2,871). The most common CAM modalities were herbal medicines, diets/nutrition, and faith-healing<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28)</xref>. The frequent reasons given for the use of CAM were to help cure or fight the child's cancer, relief of symptom, and support of ongoing use of conventional medicine<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28)</xref>. There were few factors related to patients' sociodemographic characteristics associated with use of CAM, and this result was different from the results of several other studies<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28)</xref>.</p><p>According to the study by Barnes et al.<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9)</xref>, for pediatric patients with specific diseases, the use of CAM was not highly prevalent. The proportions were 2% in insomnia, 3% in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), 5% in other musculoskeletal diseases, 5% in stress or anxiety, 7% in head or chest colds, and 7% in back or neck pain<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9)</xref>. From these results, it is presumed that patients in these cases use CAM to manage symptoms, to maintain and manage health, or to prevent illness, rather than to treat specific diseases<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28)</xref>. Many studies, however, reported a higher frequency of CAM use in pediatric patients with chronic diseases, such as asthma, autism, ADHD, cancer, and sickle cell anemia. Medical symptoms such as nausea and abdominal pain rather than certain medical diagnoses were found to be some of the factors associated with the use of CAM<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28)</xref>.</p><p>In the study by Oshikoya et al.<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29)</xref>, the researchers interviewed parents of children with epilepsy (n=122), asthma (n=78), or sickle cell anemia (n=118). Three hundred three types of CAM were used by 99 patients (31%) (epilepsy, 38%; sickle cell anemia, 36%; asthma, 25%). The most commonly used CAMs were biological products (58%), while alternative medical systems (27%) as well as mind/body interventions (14%) were also employed. Important factors influencing the use of CAM were relatives, friends, and neighbors. Eighty-five parents (86%) were going to report the use of CAM to their physicians, but had not yet done so. In 7% of the patients, adverse reactions were associated with CAM use.</p><p>Levy and Hyman<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30)</xref> investigated the use of CAM for children with autistic spectrum disorder (ASD). About 50%&#x02013;75% (n=50&#x02013;112) of children with autism were found to use CAM<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31)</xref>. Patients with comorbid intellectual disability may have a higher frequency of use of CAM. In the study by Levy et al.<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32)</xref>, one-third of children requested for examination of ASD were found to have already used CAM, even before diagnosis. The most frequently used form of CAM for children with ASD were mind/body practices<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30)</xref>.</p><p>In children with inflammatory bowel disease, adverse effect was the significant predictor of CAM use<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33)</xref>. In cases of children with asthma, the significant predictors of use of CAM were older age and worse control of symptoms. Also, more medications and more medical visits as well as more side effects were significant predictors in using CAM<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34)</xref>. A study in Italy showed that the most common reason for the use of CAM was a fear of side effects of conventional therapy for routine illness<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35)</xref>. In the study by Hanson et al.<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36)</xref>, 75% of parents of children with ASD chose the use of CAM because they felt CAM was perceived to be safe and it did not have side effect or they experienced side effects of conventional therapy previously. The purposes of the use of CAM in children with ASD are treatment of major symptoms of ASD, improvement of attention, enhancement of relaxation, treatment of gastrointestinal symptoms, regulation of sleep and promotion of general health<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31)</xref>. The characteristics of the use of CAM in children with other chronic diseases are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The use of CAM in children with neurologic diseases is common, ranging from 24%&#x02013;78% and it is more frequent than the use in healthy children.
