    "Patients with inherited diseases of the retina (IRD) often exhibit signs and symptoms of Flammer syndrome (FS). Acupuncture treatment has shown its positive effect on visual function in patients with IRD. The aim of the present study is to examine the effect of acupuncture on signs and symptoms of FS in a cohort of patients suffering simultaneously FS and IRD.A prospective pilot study was performed on 17 patients with FS and IRD: rod-cone dystrophy, Nr: 12 (RCD); cone-rod dystrophy, Nr: 3 (CRD) and inherited macular dystrophy, Nr: 2 (IMD; 12♀, 5♂; mean age: 44.19 y; SD ±17.09 y). Acupuncture treatment was done applying needle acupuncture of the body and the ears. The treatment was scheduled at 10 half-hour sessions over 5 weeks. Primary outcome was evaluation of the post-acupuncture effect on the signs and symptoms of FS in IRD patients using multiple-choice questionnaires.Following acupuncture, we found improvement in signs and symptoms of FS in patients suffering simultaneously IRD, as for instance (Nr. patients: improvement/suffering/total): a reduced tiredness (10/11/17), shorter sleep onset time (10/11/17), warmer feet and hands (10/10/17) and reduced frequency of headache attacks (9/11/17). Surprisingly, in four RCD patients and in one IMD patient, a reduction of macular edema was documented.The applied acupuncture protocol for FS in IRD patients showed improvement in FS signs and symptoms and was tolerated well. Nevertheless, the objective evaluation of this complementary therapy on FS in IRD patients remains to be elucidated."
